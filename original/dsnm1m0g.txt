DSNB200I UPDATE VVDS FAILED. DSNAME = dsn, MMRC=cccccccc CONNECTION-ID=xxxxxxxx, CORRELATION-ID=yyyyyyyyyyyy, LUW-ID=logical-unit-of-work-id =token
Explanation: DB2 was unable to update the data set high-used RBA in the VSAM volume data set (VVDS) when it
was ready to close a data set that was used by a RECOVER, LOAD, or REORG utility job. The error was detected by
the media manager catalog update function that issues system message IEC161I. The dsn indicates the DSNAME of
the data set. MMRC is the return code that DB2 received from the media manager catalog update service. Refer to
z/OS DFSMSdfp Diagnosis Reference for a description of these codes.
The connection ID, correlation ID, and logical-unit-of-work ID (LUW-ID) identify the user or application that
encountered the problem.
An LUW-ID of '*' indicates that the thread does not have an LUW-ID. If the LUW-ID is not an '*', the value is a
logical-unit-of-work-id that is assigned to the thread followed by an '=' sign and a token value which can be used in
place of logical-unit-of-work-id in any DB2 command that accepts logical-unit-of-work-id as input.
System action: DB2 continues closing this data set. However, the utility job is informed with a 00C2010C 'resource
unavailable' reason code. The utility job is left in a failed state.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: To determine the cause of the error, refer to system message IEC161I in the
appropriate MVS publication. Correct the error, and then notify the user to reinvoke the application.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v IDCAMS LISTCAT output for the ICF (VSAM) catalog that contains the DB2 subsystem catalog that defined the
failing index or table.
v IDCAMS LISTCAT output that shows the attributes of all active log data sets for the DB2 member that failed.
DSNB204I OPEN OF DATA SET FAILED. DSNAME = dsn
Explanation: A required data set of a DB2 table or index space could not be opened. The error was detected by the
media manager CONNECT function that issues system message IEC161I. The dsn indicates the DSNAME of the data
set.
After being issued for a given data set, this message is disabled for that data set.
System action: Buffer manager functions that detect this condition terminate.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: To determine the cause of the error, refer to system message IEC161I in the

DSNB209I csect-name-BUFFER MANAGER TABLESPACE/INDEXSPACE CLEAN-UP ROUTINE (DSNB1CFC) HAS BEEN SCHEDULED FOR DBNAME = database-name, SPACENAME = space-name , INSTANCEinstance-number , PSID = X'psid'
Explanation: DB2 detected an abnormal condition for one of the following reasons:
v The associated table space or index space contains modified pages that cannot be written to DASD for a period of
time that is longer than expected. This situation can be caused by either an unusually long period of continuous
updates or by an internal logic error.
v An abnormal termination occurred because of inconsistent data or an incomplete update to the page.
DB2 scheduled the table space or index space cleanup routine (DSNB1CFC) for the associated table space or index
space. DSNB1CFC acquires a drain lock to ensure that no updates are in progress. Data is inaccessible to users
during the cleanup process.
For recoverable inconsistent pages with unbalanced write intents, DB2 initiates the recovery process and reconstructs
the pages using the DB2 log. For other modified pages with unbalanced write intents, the buffer manager forces the
pages to be written back to DASD and then makes the buffer space available for reassignment.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
database-name
The name of the database that is associated with the action.
space-name
The name of the table space or index space that is associated with the action.
instance-number
The instance number of the table space or index space.
psid The internal identifier for the table space or index space. This value is used to associate this message with
the follow-on message DSNB221I, which might be issued.
System action: DB2 is ready to clean up the associated table space or index space. However, before any cleanup is
initiated, DB2 requests a drain on the table space or index space. DB2 waits indefinitely for this drain. Therefore, all
activities against the table space or index space, or both, must be quiesced before the cleanup process can proceed.
After the cleanup process completes, the table space or index space is automatically made accessible to users.
User response: If the cleanup activity does not seem to finish,DB2 might still be waiting for a drain on the table
space or index space. Issue a -DISPLAY DATABASE CLAIMERS command for the table space or index space in
question to determine whether the cleanup routine is still waiting for a drain. If it is still waiting, identify the
claimers of the table space or index space. If the jobs are holding claims for a very long duration (for example, they
are waiting for input), you might need to cancel those jobs in order to allow the cleanup process to proceed.

DSNB221I csect-name-BUFFER MANAGER TABLESPACE/INDEXSPACE CLEAN-UP PROCESS WAS NOT REQUIRED FOR PSID = X'psid'
Explanation: This message indicates that the buffer manager (BM) table space or index space cleanup process was
bypassed for the associated table space or index space. After quiescing all other activities against the table space or
index space, the buffer manager discovered that the table space or index space is no longer in active mode; that is, it
was closed.
The abnormal condition detected earlier was resolved by buffer manager close page set processing. Refer to the
corresponding message, DSNB209I, using psid as the matching field, for the reasons the buffer manager schedules the
table space or index space cleanup process. The psid is the internal identifier for the associated table space or index
space.
System action: Processing continues.
DSNB223I csect-name-BUFFER MANAGER TABLESPACE/INDEXSPACE CLEANUP PROCESS WAS SKIPPED FOR PSID = X'psid'
Explanation: This message indicates that the table space or index space cleanup process was bypassed for the
associated table space or index space. During the process of quiescing all other activities against the table space or
index space, an error that is not recoverable was detected. The error might be caused by any of the following
conditions:
v An out-of-storage condition was detected by IRLM.
v The table space or index space was dropped because of a backout.
It is assumed that the abnormal condition detected earlier can later be resolved by the close page set processing.
Refer to the corresponding message DSNB209I (use psid as the matching field) for the reasons for scheduling the table
space or index space cleanup process. The psid specifies the internal identifier for the associated table space or index
space.
System action: Processing continues.
System programmer response: The associated table space or index space might contain inconsistent data. Issue the
DB2 STOP TABLESPACE or INDEXSPACE command to allow close page set processing to perform cleanup for the
associated table space or index space.

function READ or WRITE
reason Reason code from the MVS IXLCACHE request
System action: The system action depends on the function being performed. If the function is a WRITE, or a READ
performed during rollback or DB2 restart, the page is added to the logical page list (LPL) for the data set and
message DSNB250E is issued. Otherwise, 'resource unavailable' is returned to the user with a reason code that
identifies the specific problem.

IXLCACHE reason code.
DSNB229I csect-name UNEXPECTED ERROR WHEN CHECKING FOR REQUEST COMPLETION FOR GROUP BUFFER POOL gbp-name MVS IXLFCOMP REASON CODE=reason
Explanation: DB2 received an unexpected error from MVS when checking for the completion of a write request to
the secondary group buffer pool for duplexing. gbp-name indicates the name of the group buffer pool. If the group
buffer pool is duplexed and the error was encountered on a request to the secondary group buffer pool, then
gbp-name indicates the name of the group buffer pool suffixed with '-SEC'.
reason is the reason code from the MVS IXLFCOMP service.

IXLFCOMP reason code.
DSNB232I csect-name - UNEXPECTED DATA SET LEVEL ID ENCOUNTERED - LEVEL ID =lvlid EXPECTED LEVEL ID=xlvlid DSN=dsn
Explanation: A required data set of a DB2 table space could not be opened. DB2 encountered an unexpected data
set level ID.
lvlid The unexpected level ID from the data set. If DB2 was unable to retrieve the level ID from the data set (for
example, if the data set had been deleted and redefined), the level ID is shown as "X''".
xlvlid The level ID recorded by DB2 previously and is the expected level ID for opening the data set
dsn The DSNAME of the data set.
This problem could be the result of data sets that were restored to a level that is inconsistent with other data sets,
inconsistent with the DB2 log, or both.
System action: DB2 sends back a 'resource unavailable' SQL code to the application and a reason code explaining
the error.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: To enable access to a data set reported as down level, take one of the following
actions:
v Restore the page set or partition to the proper level (use DSN1COPY, DFHSM, or another tool).
Identify the level ID of a copy of the page set or partition by running the DSN1PRNT(FORMAT) utility. The level
ID is found in the header page of the page set or partition.
v Recover the down level page set or partition to currency by running the RECOVER or RECOVER LOGONLY
utility.
v Accept the down levelling by running the REPAIR utility with the LEVELID option.
This option is only valid if DB2 is able to access the level ID (lvlid is not "X''").
Inconsistent data problems might result from this action and are the user's responsibility.
v Replace the contents of the page set or partition using the LOAD REPLACE utility.
v Explicitly restore the page set to a prior point in time with the RECOVER utility.
If the expected level ID is less than the encountered level ID, it is possible that the object identified in the message
was ported from another system improperly or it might indicate that DSNDB01.SYSLGRNX is down level. If the
problem is in the object identified in the message, the actions listed above can be used to allow access to the data. If
the problem is in SYSLGRNX, this is a serious situation that compromises the recoverability of all objects managed
by DB2. Investigate whether SYSLGRNX might have inadvertently been restored to a point in time inconsistent with
the rest of the DB2 system.
DSNB235A csect-name - GRS RESOURCE SHORTAGE DETECTED BY DB2
Explanation: A z/OS Global Resource Serialization (GRS) resource shortage was detected when DB2 opened or
closed a data set.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
System action: To relieve the GRS resource shortage, DB2 might close data sets that have not been used recently.
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
Message DSNB235A is deleted when DB2 detects that the GRS resource shortage has been relieved.
System programmer response: Work with your DB2 administrator to reduce the DB2 workload, or reduce the
number of open data sets.
Problem determination: GRS message ISG353E might be displayed when the resource shortage occurs. This
message identifies the specific storage area that has a shortage.
GRS message ISG354I displays when the resource shortage has been relieved.

DSNB250E csect-name A PAGE RANGE WAS ADDED TO THE LOGICAL PAGE LIST. DATABASE NAME=database-name, SPACE NAME=space-name, INSTANCE=instance-number, DATA SET NUMBER=data-set-number, PAGE RANGE X'low-page' TO X'high-page', START LRSN=X'start-lrsn', END LRSN=X'end-lrsn', START RBA=X'start-rba', LPL TRACE ID=trace-id, LPL REASON TYPE=reason-type
Explanation: DB2 added a page range to the logical page list (LPL) for the specified data set, because the pages in
the page range had a problem.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
database-name
The name of the database.
space-name
The name of the table space or index space that is associated with the action.
instance-number
The instance number of the table space or index space.
data-set-number
The data set number.
low-page and high-page
The range of pages that was added to the LPL. The values are hexadecimal page numbers.
start-lrsn and end-lrsn
The log range that is needed to recover the pages in the page range. These values are RBA values unless
DB2 is in a data sharing environment. In that case, these values are LRSN values. A zero value for end-lrsn
refers to the current end of the recovery log.
start-rba
In a data sharing environment, the starting RBA value of the recovery log range if the value is not zero. The
start-rba value applies to log records for only the DB2 member that issued the message.
trace-id A value that is used for serviceability by IBM Software Support.
reason-type
The reason why the pages were added to the LPL. reason-type can contain one of the following values:
DASD DB2 encountered a DASD I/O error when trying to read or write pages on DASD.
LOGAPPLY
DB2 cannot apply log records to the pages.
GBP DB2 cannot successfully read from or externalize the pages to the group buffer pool. This problem
occurred for one of the following reasons:
v a link or structure failure
v the group buffer pool is in rebuild status
v the group buffer pool was disconnected
LOCK DB2 cannot get the required page latch or page P-lock on the pages.
CASTOUT
The DB2 castout processor cannot successfully cast out the pages.
NOTLOGGD
Work on an object needs to be undone. However, the work was not logged, because the object has
the NOT LOGGED attribute.
System action: The pages are added to the LPL
For any reason-type value other than NOTLOGGD, DB2 initiates the automatic LPL recovery. The pages remain
inaccessible until they are recovered.
If you attempt to access a page in the LPL, DB2 returns SQLCODE -904 with reason code 00C20206.
If MVS detects a problem when accessing the group buffer pool, DB2 writes a SYS1.LOGREC entry that describes the
error.
System programmer response: Take the appropriate actions for the reason-type value based on the console message.
To recover pages from the LPL, perform one of the following actions:
v For a reason-type value other than NOTLOGGD, issue the START DATABASE command with the SPACENAM
option.
v Run the RECOVER utility
v Run the LOAD utility

DSNB301E csect-name GROUP BUFFER POOL gbp-name CANNOT BE CONNECTED DB2 REASON CODE = reason-code MVS IXLCONN REASON CODE = ixlconn-reason
Explanation: DB2 was not able to connect to the named group buffer pool. This message is generally issued once for
each DB2 subsystem for each DB2 reason code, except 00C20204, until the failure condition is corrected.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
gbp-name
The name of the group buffer pool.
reason-code
The DB2 reason code.
For DB2 reason code 00C20204, which indicates a problem during MVS IXLCONN processing, the DSNB301E message is issued once for each DB2 subsystem for each IXLCONN reason code until the failure
condition is corrected.
ixlconn-reason
When the DB2 reason code is 00C20204, the MVS IXLCONN reason code. For all other DB2 reason code
values, ixlconn-reason contains zeros.
System action: If the connection was requested on behalf of an access request by an SQL user on this DB2,
SQLCODE -904 (resource unavailable) is returned to the SQL user with the DB2 reason code shown in this message.
If the connection was requested on behalf of an SQL user on another DB2 in the data sharing group, SQLCODE -904
(resource unavailable) is returned to the SQL user with DB2 reason code 00C20252. This indicates that the requested
table space or index space is unavailable because another DB2 cannot connect to the group buffer pool.
If the MVS IXLCONN reason code is xxxx0C08 (structure allocation failed because there was no suitable facility to
allocate based on the preference list in the MVS CFRM administrative policy), or if the MVS IXLCONN reason code
is xxxx084C (user does not have proper Security Access Facility (SAF) authorization), then IFCID 0250, if active,
contains additional diagnostic information.
System programmer response: See the specified DB2 reason code for information about appropriate actions.

DSNB302I csect-name GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname IS ALLOCATED IN A VOLATILE STRUCTURE
Explanation: The DB2 group buffer pool structure is volatile.
One DB2 member issues this message whenever the structure has the volatile attribute. DB2 detects this either on the
first connection to the group buffer pool or when the attribute changes later. DB2 always requests nonvolatile group
buffer pools but allows allocation in a volatile structure if that is all that is available.
System action: DB2 processing continues.
System programmer response: To cause the group buffer pools to be allocated in nonvolatile coupling facilities,
ensure that:
v At least a subset of your coupling facilities are configured correctly for nonvolatility.
v The MVS CFRM policy correctly specifies the nonvolatile coupling facilities in the preference list for the group
buffer pool coupling facility structures.
Even when these things are correctly done, there might be instances when a suitable coupling facility in the
preference list cannot be found (for example, not enough free space), and therefore allocation occurs in a different
coupling facility. MVS tries to allocate the structure in the facility that best meets the structure allocation request as
follows:
1st choice:
Coupling facility that meets the volatility requirement, the space requirement, and the exclusion list
requirement.
2nd choice:
Coupling facility that meets the volatility requirement and the storage requirement.
3rd choice:
Coupling facility that has the best fit (most available free space) even though this might be less than the
amount requested.
4th choice:
Structure cannot be allocated.
IFCID 0250, if activated, contains a list of the coupling facilities on which allocation was attempted.
DSNB303E csect-name A LOSS OF CONNECTIVITY WAS DETECTED TO GROUP BUFFER POOL gpbname
Explanation: Connectivity to group buffer pool gpbname was lost.
System action: DB2 disconnects from the coupling facility structure with REASON=FAILURE.
The action taken in response to this problem depends on the attempted function, as follows:
v For a coupling facility read: SQLCODE -904 (resource unavailable) is returned to the SQL user with a reason code
indicating the specific error.
v For a coupling facility read during rollback, backout, or restart: The inaccessible page is added to the logical page
list (LPL) for the page set. Message DSNB250E is issued for the first page of each data set added to the LPL.
v For a coupling facility read during castout: The castout operation cannot complete.
v For a coupling facility write: The changed page is added to the LPL for the page set.
DSNB304I csect-name GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname WAS SET TO 'DAMAGE ASSESSMENT PENDING' STATUS
Explanation: A coupling facility structure for a group buffer pool was damaged.
System action:
v DB2 puts the group buffer pool into 'damage assessment pending' (DAP) status. Message DSNB304I indicates the
DAP status. The group buffer pool cannot be accessed until DAP status is cleared.
v The DB2 damage assessment process determines which table spaces and index spaces are using the failed group
buffer pool and puts those spaces into 'group buffer pool recovery pending' (GRECP) status.
v After DB2 sets all the necessary spaces to GRECP status, the DAP status for the group buffer pool is cleared.
Message DSNB305I indicates that DAP status is cleared.
DSNB305I csect-name 'DAMAGE ASSESSMENT PENDING' STATUS WAS CLEARED FOR GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname
Explanation: Damage assessment completed and the 'damage assessment pending' (DAP) status is cleared for the
group buffer pool (GBP). At this point, the group buffer pool status is no longer restricted and DB2 attempts to
reconnect to the group buffer pool on the next reference to a GBP-dependent page set within the associated buffer
pool.
Message DSNB304I precedes this message.
DSNB306I csect-name THE REQUESTED LENGTH OF THE LOCAL CACHE VECTOR COULD NOT BE ALLOCATED FOR GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname REQUESTED LENGTH = length1 ALLOCATED LENGTH = length2
Explanation: DB2 connected to the group buffer pool indicated by gbpname, but the MVS Cross-system Extended
Services (XES) component could not allocate the requested size of the local cache vector (LCV) in the hardware
system area (HSA). DB2 requires an LCV size that is large enough to handle all pages in the member's buffer pool.
length1 indicates the LCV size (in number of bits) that DB2 requested. length2 indicates the LCV size (in number of
bits) that XES was able to allocate.
To prevent flooding the operator console, this message is only issued once per DB2 member per group buffer pool
until the condition is corrected.
System action: DB2 disconnects from the GBP and issues message DSNB301E with reason code 00C20208, if it has
not yet been issued.
SQLCODE -904 is returned to the user with a reason code of 00C20208.
System programmer response: There is not enough HSA storage on the processor to support the size of the local
cache vector. The details of HSA allocation are machine-dependent and are defined by the hardware. To correct this
problem, take one or both of the following actions:
v Consult the documentation for your processor hardware to determine if the HSA storage allocation can be
increased, and if so, how to do it.
v Modify the software configuration in your parallel sysplex to reduce the number or size of the vectors that are in
use by other coupling facility structure users. Consider the following possible solutions:
C Use the DB2 ALTER BUFFERPOOL command to reduce the size of this local buffer pool. This means that you
might have to reduce the size of the virtual pool.
C Use the DB2 ALTER BUFFERPOOL command to reduce the size of another local buffer pool that is already
connected to a group buffer pool. This means that you might have to reduce the size of the virtual pool. If you
make a connected buffer pool smaller, DB2 can usually contract the size of the corresponding LCV dynamically,
making HSA storage available. However, DB2 cannot always do the dynamic LCV contraction. In cases where
DB2 cannot dynamically contract the LCV size, you can use the DB2 ALTER BUFFERPOOL command to either
force a deallocation of the LCV or to force a contraction of the LCV as follows:
1. Redefine the virtual pool to be smaller than the original size.
2. Take one of the following actions:
a. Make the virtual pool very small (perhaps 50 pages or less). Making the virtual pool sufficiently small
should let DB2 dynamically contract the LCV, or
b. Delete the virtual pool to let DB2 disconnect from the group buffer pool. This frees the entire LCV
associated with that member's connection to that group buffer pool.
C Consolidate your group buffer pool-dependent page sets into fewer buffer pools to reduce the number of group
buffer pool connections.
C Consult the documentation for the other software components that might be using a coupling facility cache or
list structure with an associated LCV to determine whether it is possible to either delete the connection or to
reduce the size of the LCV associated with the connection.
DSNB307I csect-name GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname WAS SUCCESSFULLY ALLOCATED BUT THE EXCLUSION LIST WAS NOT HONORED
Explanation: DB2 successfully connected to the group buffer pool and allocated the group buffer pool in a coupling
facility. However, the group buffer pool was allocated in a coupling facility containing a structure in the exclusion
list.
System programmer response: If you require that the exclusion list be honored, you must ensure that there is
sufficient space in the coupling facilities that are not in the exclusion list. IFCID 0250 provides information about
which facilities were attempted.
DSNB308I csect-name GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname WAS SUCCESSFULLY ALLOCATED BUT THE ALLOCATED SIZE OF alloc_size IS LESS THAN THE REQUESTED SIZE OF req_size
Explanation: DB2 successfully connected to the group buffer pool and allocated the group buffer pool in a coupling
facility. However, the allocated size of the group buffer pool was less than the requested size in the MVS CFRM
administrative policy because there is not enough space in the preference list facilities. Both alloc_size and req_size are
in 4KB blocks.
System programmer response: IFCID 0250 provides information about which coupling facilities were used for
attempted allocation.
DSNB309I csect-name GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname HAS BEEN DISCONNECTED WITH A REASON OF 'reason'
Explanation: DB2 disconnected from the named group buffer pool.
reason indicates one of the following values:
NORMAL
DB2 disconnected the group buffer pool normally. MVS deletes the connection.
FAILURE
DB2 disconnected the group buffer pool abnormally. MVS puts the connection into a 'failed-persistent' state.
DB2 disconnects the GBP with a reason of FAILURE when some type of error has been detected, and castout
processing cannot proceed. Usually the error involves a connectivity failure to either the coupling facility or
DASD. This message is preceded by message DSNB303E, and probably a series of DSNB311I and DSNB312I
messages.
If this message is issued because connectivity was lost to the group buffer pool, this message signifies that this DB2
member has completed its processing of the error.
System programmer response: See the system programmer response for message DSNB311I or DSNB312I.
DSNB310I csect-name GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname IS ALLOCATED IN A NONVOLATILE STRUCTURE
Explanation: The coupling facility storage in which the group buffer pool is allocated was previously volatile, but is
now nonvolatile. For availability reasons, we recommend that DB2 group buffer pools be allocated in nonvolatile
coupling facility storage. When DB2 connects a group buffer pool, it requests that the backing coupling facility
structure be allocated in nonvolatile storage. If the request for nonvolatile storage is not honored, DB2 issues message
DSNB302I.  System action: DB2 processing continues.  DSNB311I csect-name DBNAME database-name SPACENAME space-name INSTANCE instance-number HAS PAGES IN THE LOGICAL PAGE LIST
Explanation: This message is issued after a loss of connectivity to a group buffer pool is detected. The named table
space or index space has one or more pages in the logical page list (LPL) that need to be recovered. This message is
issued after DB2 has completed its processing for the table space or index space; this point is the earliest point at
which you can recover LPL pages for that table space or index.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
database-name
The name of the database that is associated with the recovery.
space-name
The name of the table space or index space that is associated with the recovery.
instance-number
The instance number of the table space or index space.
System action: The pages in the LPL are not accessible until they have been recovered.
System programmer response: Issue the START DATABASE command with the named table space or index to
recover the LPL pages. You must issue the START DATABASE command from a DB2 member that can connect to the
group buffer pool. Alternatively, you can use the RECOVER utility or the LOAD utility to recover the LPL pages.

DSNB312I csect-name DBNAME database-name SPACENAME space-name INSTANCE instance-number PARTITION partition-number HAS PAGES IN THE LOGICAL PAGE LIST
Explanation: This message is issued after a loss of connectivity to a group buffer pool is detected. A partition of the
named table space or index has one or more pages in the logical page list (LPL) that need to be recovered. This
message is issued after DB2 has completed its processing for the partition; this point is the earliest point at which
you can recover the LPL pages for that partition.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
database-name
The name of the database that is associated with the recovery.
space-name
The name of the table space or index space that is associated with the recovery.
instance-number
The instance number of the table space or index space.
partition-number
The partition number.
System action: The pages in the LPL are not accessible until they have been recovered.
System programmer response: Issue the START DATABASE command on the table space or index space partition
to recover the LPL pages. You must issue the START DATABASE command from a DB2 member that can connect to
the group buffer pool. Alternatively, you can use the RECOVER utility or the LOAD utility to recover the LPL pages.

DSNB313I csect-name GROUP BUFFER POOL gpbname TO BE DISCONNECTED REASON=reason LOSSCONN PERCENTAGE=percentage
Explanation: This DB2 member is disconnecting from group buffer pool gpbname because it has lost connectivity to
the coupling facility in which the group buffer pool is allocated.
reason is one of the following:
NOSFMPOL
MVS cannot determine the scope of the loss of connectivity because there is no active SFM policy with
CONNFAIL(YES).
LOSSCONN
MVS determined that the scope of the loss of connectivity was less than 100%.
NOXESEVL
MVS started to try to determine the scope of the loss of connectivity, but some condition occurred which
prevented MVS from being able to complete the evaluation. One example of such a condition would be that
the SFM policy became inactive while MVS was trying to do the evaluation.
If reason is LOSSCONN, then percentage indicates the percentage of lost connectivity that was calculated by MVS.
MVS evaluates the scope of the loss of connectivity in terms of SFM weights associated with the systems which have
lost connectivity and which have active connectors to the coupling facility structure (if there are systems that do not
have an active connector to the coupling facility structure, then those systems are not factored into the "percentage
loss of connectivity" calculation).
If reason is not LOSSCONN, then percentage is not applicable (it should appear as zero).
System action: The DB2 member disconnects the group buffer pool, putting its connection into a "failed-persistent"
state.
If there are transactions that are in progress at the time of the connectivity failure, DB2 might need to add pages to
the logical page list (LPL).
System programmer response: Use the START DATABASE command to recover the LPL pages. If DSNDB01 or DSNDB06 objects have LPL pages, you might need to recover these first, before proceeding with LPL recovery for other objects.  DSNB314I csect-name DAMAGE ASSESSMENT TO BE TRIGGERED FOR GROUP BUFFER POOL gpbname REASON=reason
Explanation: DB2 is about to initiate the damage assessment function for group buffer pool gpbname because of a
detected error in either the coupling facility in which the group buffer pool was allocated, or in the connectivity from
the MVS systems to the coupling facility.
reason is one of the following:
100%LCON
An error has occurred in a coupling facility or in the attachments of MVS systems to a coupling facility
which has caused all DB2 members to lose connectivity to the named group buffer pool.
STRFAIL
There was an error in the coupling facility in which the group buffer pool was allocated which caused a
failure of the coupling facility structure.
CONERROR
The named group buffer pool is currently allocated in a coupling facility, but DB2 cannot connect to the
group buffer pool because the system on which it is running does not currently have connectivity, and MVS
has indicated that currently no other member is actively connected and has connectivity.
DAP The named group buffer pool is in damage assessment pending (DAP) state.
System action: DB2 triggers the damage assessment function to ensure that any changed pages that might have
been cached in the affected group buffer pool get marked as "needing recovery" (the objects to which the pages
belong are marked in GRECP state). This message should be immediately followed by a DSNB304I message
indicating that the group buffer pool has been entered into damage assessment pending (DAP) state.
If there are transactions that are in progress at the time of the connectivity failure, DB2 might need to add pages to
the logical page list (LPL).
There is one case where DB2 triggers damage assessment for a group buffer pool, but no DSNB314I message is
issued. This case is where the group buffer pool was manually deleted (via MVS SETXCF FORCE commands) while
all connections to the group buffer pool were failed-persistent (e.g. all DB2 members were down). In this case, the
next DB2 member to connect to the group buffer pool will cause MVS to try to reallocate a new instance of the group
buffer pool in some coupling facility in the CFRM policy preference list. If the allocation succeeds, then DB2, by
doing a coupling facility structure version id comparison, will detect that the previous instance of the group buffer
pool had been lost, and will trigger damage assessment. But you will not receive the DSNB314I message in this case,
nor will you receive the DSNB304I or DSNB305I messages indicating that the group buffer pool has been put into
damage assessment pending (DAP) state. You will only receive a series of DSNB322I and/or DSNB323I messages
indicating those pagesets or partitions that have been put into GRECP state by the damage assessment process.
System programmer response: Use the START DATABASE command to recover the LPL pages and GRECP objects.
If DSNDB01 or DSNDB06 objects are in GRECP state or have LPL pages, you might need to recover these first, before
proceeding with GRECP or LPL recovery for other objects.
DSNB315I csect-name GROUP BUFFER POOL gpbname IS ALLOCATED AS GBPCACHE cacheatt
Explanation:
YES The group buffer pool will be used for data caching.
NO The group buffer pool will not be used for data caching. It will be used for cross invalidation only.
One DB2 member issues this message whenever the structure is allocated. DB2 detects this on the first connection to
the group buffer pool either in the mainline processing or during group buffer pool rebuild.
System action: DB2 processing continues.
DSNB316I csect-name GROUP BUFFER POOL gbp-name DELETED BECAUSE OF SUBSYSTEM PARAMETER SETTING
Explanation: The specified group buffer pool was deleted during DB2 restart processing.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
gbp-name
The name of the group buffer pool that was deleted.
The group buffer pool is deleted when there are no other DB2 subsystems connected to it, if the
DEL_CFSTRUCT_ON_RESTART subsystem parameter indicates that DB2 should attempt to delete all group buffer
pools.
System action: The group buffer pool named in the message is deleted.
User response: No action is required.
Related reference:
DEL CF STRUCTS field (DEL_CFSTRUCTS_ON_RESTART subsystem parameter) (DB2 Installation and
Migration)
DSNB319A csect-name THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF SPACE IN GROUP BUFFER POOL gbp-name
Explanation: The amount of storage in the group buffer pool (GBP) coupling facility structure available for writing
new pages is low. The GBP is 75 percent full with changed data. As the GBP fills with changed data, the castout
thresholds are continuously reached, and the castout engines must continuously work to attempt to keep the number
of changed pages in the GBP below the castout thresholds. Also, the more changed data the GBP contains, the less
efficiently it operates. Completely running out of GBP storage can result in transaction delays and in pages being
added to the logical page list (LPL).
System action: DB2 processing continues.
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
This message might not be automatically deleted in a pre SP5.2.1-JES3 environment.
Operator response: Contact the system programmer to fix the storage problem.
System programmer response: You can relieve the GBP storage shortage by taking one or more of the following
actions:
v Use the ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command to lower the CLASST and GBPOOLT castout thresholds.
v Use the ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command to lower the GBPCHKPT GBP checkpoint frequency.
v Use the MVS SETXCF START,REBUILD command to expand the GBP coupling facility structure. If you rebuild,
you can use the ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command to lower the RATIO so that a higher percentage of the
GBP storage is given to data entries over directory entries.
v If you are running on MVS 5.2 or a subsequent release, you can use the MVS SETXCF START,ALTER command to
expand the size of the GBP (the maximum size to which you can expand is determined by the SIZE parameter in
the CFRM policy that was used to allocate the GBP).
If you don't do anything to relieve the storage shortage, message DSNB325A appears if the GBP reaches 90 percent
full.
Message DSNB327I appears when the GBP storage shortage is relieved.
You can monitor the amount of GBP storage in use with the DISPLAY GBPOOL command and with the DB2 statistics
trace. Monitor the castout activity to ensure that castouts are keeping up with the rate of GBP-write activity. You can
use Performance trace classes 20 and 21 (specifically, IFCIDs 0261, 0262 and 0263) to do more detailed monitoring of
the DB2 castout processing.
DSNB320I csect-name DBNAME database-name SPACENAME space-name INSTANCEinstance-number PARTITION partition-number IN GROUP BUFFERPOOL pool-name IS IN GROUP BUFFERPOOL RECOVERY PENDING STATE
Explanation: The named table space or index space partition is in group buffer pool recovery pending (GRECP)
status.

The name of the control section that issued the message.
database-name
The name of the database.
space-name
The name of the table space or index space.
instance-number
The instance number of the table space or index space.
partition-number
The partition number.

The name of the group buffer pool.
System action: The data in the named partition is not accessible.
User response: Issue the START DATABASE command on the partition to remove the GRECP status and make the
data accessible again. You can also use the RECOVER or LOAD utility with the REPLACE option to clear the GRECP
status.

spaces or index spaces in GRECP status. First, start the failed DB2 members that hold retained P-locks on the table
space or index space.Issue the -START DATABASE command on the table space or index space to remove the GRECP
status and make the data accessible again. You can also use the RECOVER or LOAD utility with the REPLACE
option to clear the GRECP status.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNB325A csect-name THERE IS A CRITICAL SHORTAGE OF SPACE IN GROUP BUFFER POOL gbp-name
Explanation: The amount of storage in the group buffer pool (GBP) coupling facility structure available for writing
new pages is critically low. The primary or secondary GBP is 90 percent full with changed data. (A gbp-name that
ends in SEC is a secondary GBP in a duplexing environment.)
As the GBP fills with changed data, the castout thresholds are continuously reached, and the castout engines must
continuously work to attempt to keep the number of changed pages in the GBP below the castout thresholds. In
addition, the more the GBP is filled with changed data, the less efficient are the coupling facility storage management
algorithms. Completely running out of GBP storage can result in transaction delays and in pages being added to the
logical page list (LPL).
System action: DB2 processing continues.
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
This message might not be automatically deleted in a pre-SP5.2.1-JES3 environment.
Operator response: Contact the system programmer to fix the storage problem.
System programmer response: You can relieve the GBP storage shortage by taking one or more of the following
actions:
v Use the ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command to lower the CLASST and GBPOOLT castout thresholds.
v Use the ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command to lower the GBPCHKPT GBP checkpoint frequency.
v Use the MVS SETXCF START,REBUILD command to expand the GBP coupling facility structure. If you rebuild,
you can use the ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command to lower the RATIO so that a higher percentage of the
GBP storage is given to data entries over directory entries.
v If you are running on MVS 5.2 or a subsequent release, you can use the MVS SETXCF START,ALTER command to
expand the size of the GBP (the maximum size to which you can expand is determined by the SIZE parameter in
the CFRM policy that was used to allocate the GBP).
If you do not do anything to relieve the storage shortage, message DSNB228I appears if a write to the GBP fails due
to a 'GBP full' condition. If DB2 detects a 'full' condition, it will suspend the transaction, initiate castout activity, and
then retry the write to the GBP. If the GBP write still fails after several retry attempts, then DB2 adds the page to
LPL.
Message DSNB327I is displayed when the GBP storage shortage is relieved.
|||| |
You can monitor the amount of GBP storage in use with the DISPLAY GBPOOL command and with the DB2 statistics
trace. Monitor the castout activity to ensure that castouts are keeping up with the rate of GBP-write activity. You can
use Performance trace classes 20 and 21 (specifically, IFCIDs 0261, 0262 and 0263) to do more detailed monitoring of
the DB2 castout processing.
DSNB327I csect-name GROUP BUFFER POOL gbp-name HAS ADEQUATE FREE SPACE
Explanation: The group buffer pool (GBP) coupling facility structure has adequate space available for the writing of
new pages to the GBP.
This message may be issued when either of the following occurs:
v Rebuilding of GBP reduces changed page count to 60% or less of GBP capacity.
v 'changed data.' entries decrease to 60% or lower when they were previously 75% GBP capacity or higher.
System action: DB2 processing continues.
DSNB330I csect-name GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname CANNOT BE CONNECTED FOR REBUILD DB2 REASON CODE = reason1 MVS IXLCONN REASON CODE = reason2
Explanation: DB2 was not able to connect to the named group buffer pool for rebuild. reason1 is the DB2 reason
code. reason2 is the MVS IXLCONN reason code. See MVS/ESA Programming: Sysplex Services Reference for an
explanation of MVS IXLxxxx reason codes.
System action: DB2 stops the rebuild.
Problem determination: If the MVS IXLCONN reason code is xxxx0C08 (structure allocation failed because there
was no suitable facility to allocate based on the preference list in the MVS CFRM administrative policy), or if the
MVS IXLCONN reason code is xxxx084C (user does not have proper Security Access Facility (SAF) authorization),
then IFCID 0250, if active, contains additional diagnostic information.
DSNB331I csect-name REBUILD STARTED FOR GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname REASON = reason
Explanation: A rebuild has been initiated for the named group buffer pool. reason indicates the reason why the
rebuild was initiated. reason can be one of the following:
OPERATOR
The operator initiated a SETXCF command to initiate the rebuild.
LOSSCONN
MVS detected a loss of connectivity to the group buffer pool.
This message is issued by each DB2 member participating in the rebuild.
System action: The DB2 members that are actively connected to the named group buffer pool participate in the
rebuild. DB2 accomplishes the group buffer pool rebuild processing in two phases:
1. Quiesce phase. Each member quiesces all local access to the group buffer pool.
2. Connect phase. Each member connects to the new structure. Each page set or partition castout owner that has
connectivity to original structure is responsible for writing pages from the original structure to the new one. If
there are not enough data entries in the new structure, the page set and partition owners cast those pages out to
DASD instead. Each member issues message DSNB332I after it completes this activity. After all members have
completed their castout owner rebuild work, the group buffer pool structure owner does the final sweep and
checks to see if there are any changed pages still remaining in the original structure. If so, the structure owner
reads the changed pages from the original structure and writes them to the new one. The structure owner issues
message DSNB333I after it has completed the final sweep.
After all members have responded to MVS indicating that its connect phase processing is complete, MVS then
notifies each member that the rebuild is complete. Each DB2 member issues message DSNB338I indicating that the
rebuild has completed successfully.
If an error occurs during the rebuild, the rebuild is stopped. Each DB2 member issues message DSNB335I indicating
the reason why the rebuild is stopping, followed by message DSNB339I indicating that the rebuild has not completed
successfully. The operator can also stop rebuilds using the MVS SETXCF command.
DSNB332I csect-name THIS MEMBER HAS COMPLETED CASTOUT OWNER WORK FOR GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname PAGES CAST OUT FROM ORIGINAL STRUCTURE = value1 PAGES WRITTEN TO NEW STRUCTURE = value2
Explanation: This DB2 member has completed its part of the rebuild processing for the named group buffer pool for
the page sets and partitions for which it is the castout owner.
value1 indicates the number of pages that this member has castout to DASD for the rebuild. If the new structure has
a sufficient number of data entries, then value1 should normally be zero because DB2 writes the changed pages from
the original structure to the new structure. However, if the new structure does not have sufficient space, then value1
could be greater than zero because DB2 responds to insufficient space in the new structure by casting the changed
pages in the original structure to DASD instead of writing them to the new structure.
value2 indicates how many changed pages this member wrote to the new structure from the original as part of the
rebuild process. If the new structure has sufficient space, then each DB2 that has connectivity to the original structure
writes the changed pages for page sets and partitions for which it is the castout owner from the original structure to
the new structure, and value2 indicates the number of pages that the DB2 member wrote.
value1 and value2 would be zero if this member has no page set or partition castout ownership responsibility.
This message is issued by each DB2 member that has connectivity to the original group buffer pool, and it is always
be preceded by message DSNB331I or DSNB740I.
System action: If this DB2 member is not the group buffer pool structure owner, then its rebuild work is done, and
it notifies MVS that it has completed its part of the rebuild and awaits later notification that all members have
completed. If this member is the structure owner, then it proceeds to its final sweep processing (see DSNB333I).
Refer to "System Action" for message DSNB331I for an explanation of the group buffer pool rebuild processing.
DSNB333I csect-name FINAL SWEEP COMPLETED FOR GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname PAGES WRITTEN TO NEW STRUCTURE = value1
Explanation: DB2 has completed the final sweep for the rebuild of the named group buffer pool. A final sweep
means that the DB2 member that is the group buffer pool structure owner ensures that all changed pages have either
been cast out to DASD or have been written to the new structure after all the page set and partition owners have
finished their work. If any changed pages are found in the original structure during the final sweep, then the
structure owner writes them out to the new structure. value1 should be zero in most cases for a manual rebuild.
value1 will probably be greater than zero in most cases where the rebuild was initiated because a DB2 lost
connectivity to the group buffer pool.
This message is issued by the structure owner and is always preceded by message DSNB332I.
System action: Immediately after issuing this message, the structure owner notifies MVS that the rebuild has
completed, and MVS should soon begin notifying each participating member that the rebuild is complete.
Refer to "System Action" for message DSNB331I for an explanation of the group buffer pool rebuild processing.
DSNB335I csect-name REBUILD STOPPED FOR GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname REASON = reason1 DB2 REASON CODE = reason2
Explanation: A rebuild has been stopped for the named group buffer pool.
reason1 indicates why the rebuild was stopped:
OPERATOR
The operator initiated an MVS SETXCF command to stop the rebuild.
LOSSCONNNEW
One or more of the DB2 members lost connectivity to the new group buffer pool structure while the rebuild
was in progress.
LOSSCONNOLD
One or more of the DB2 members lost connectivity to the original group buffer pool structure while the
rebuild was in progress.
STRFAILNEW
The new group buffer pool structure failed while the rebuild was in progress.
STRFAILOLD
The original group buffer pool structure failed while the rebuild was in progress.
DB2REASON
DB2 decided to stop the rebuild. The reason code given in reason2 indicates why DB2 stopped the rebuild.
INSUFFCONN
New structure does not provide connectivity that is better than or equivalent to the current structure.
NOBETRCONN
New structure does not provide better connectivity than the current structure for a LossConn rebuild
If reason1 indicates 'DB2REASON', then reason2 specifies a DB2 reason code that indicates why DB2 stopped the
rebuild. If reason1 is not 'DB2REASON', then reason2 is zero.
This message is normally preceded by message DSNB331I, which indicates that the rebuild was started and the
reason why the rebuild was started. This message is issued by each DB2 member participating in the rebuild. This
message is followed by message DSNB339I.
System action: The new structure is discarded. If the original structure is still usable, then all members that still
have connectivity to the original structure resume using it. Members that do not have connectivity to the original
structure disconnect, and their connections become failed-persistent.
If the original structure is not usable, then DB2 initiates damage assessment processing for the group buffer pool.
System programmer response: If the rebuild stopped because of DB2REASON, see the explanation for the reason
code given.
DSNB338I csect-name THE REBUILD FOR GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname HAS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
Explanation: The rebuild for the named group buffer pool has successfully completed.
This message is preceded by message DSNB331I which indicates the reason why the rebuild was started. This
message is issued by each DB2 member participating in the rebuild.
System action: The original structure is discarded and all DB2s that are connected to the group buffer pool begin
using the new structure.
DSNB339I csect-name THE STOP OF THE REBUILD FOR GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname HAS COMPLETED
Explanation: The stop of the rebuild for the named group buffer pool has completed.
This message is preceded by message DSNB335I which indicates the reason why the rebuild was stopped. This
message is issued by each DB2 member participating in the rebuild.
System action: The new structure is discarded. If the original structure is still usable, then all members that still
have connectivity to the original structure resume using it, and members that do not have connectivity to the original
structure disconnect and their connection goes into a failed-persistent state.
If the original structure is not usable, then DB2 initiates damage assessment processing for the group buffer pool.
DSNB340I csect-name UNEXPECTED ERROR DURING REBUILD FOR GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname MVS service-name RETURN CODE = rc MVS service-name REASON CODE = reason
Explanation: DB2 received an unexpected error from MVS during rebuild processing for the named group buffer
pool.
service-name is one of the following:
v IXLREBLD
v IXLEERSP
rc is the return code from the MVS service and reason is the reason code.
System action: DB2 stops the rebuild.
System programmer response: See MVS/ESA Programming: Sysplex Services Reference for an explanation of the return
and reason code for the named MVS service.
DSNB350I csect-name DBNAME database-name SPACENAME space-name INSTANCE instance-number CANNOT BE AUTOMATICALLY RECOVERED. DB2 REASON CODE = reason-code

DSNB352I csect-name AUTOMATIC RECOVERY CANNOT BE INITIATED FOR GROUPBUFFER POOL gbp-name REASON = reason
Explanation: Following a failure of the named group buffer pool, DB2 is not able to initiate automatic recovery.
reason indicates the reason why automatic recovery was not initiated:
AUTORECNO
The AUTOREC option is set to NO for the group buffer pool.
CONNRELEASE
At least one actively connected DB2 member is not at the proper release to support automatic recovery.
System action: The page sets and partitions that are in group buffer pool recovery pending (GRECP) status remain
inaccessible.
User response: Use the DB2 -START DATABASE command on the page sets and partitions to remove the GRECP
status and make the data accessible. You can also use the RECOVERor LOAD utility with the REPLACE option to
clear the GRECP status.
If reason is AUTORECNO and you want to enable automatic recovery for the group buffer pool, use the ALTER
GROUPBUFFERPOOL command to set AUTOREC to YES for the group buffer pool.
If reason is CONNRELEASE, then you must ensure that all DB2 members in the group are running at the appropriate
release. Automatic recovery is not supported unless all members are running Version 5 or a later release.

DSNB353I csect-name ASYNCHRONOUS GRECP RECOVERY IN PROGRESS FOR GROUP BUFFER POOL bpoolname
Explanation: Following a group buffer pool failure, DB2 triggers an automatic recovery process to attempt to
recover GRECP page sets for the specified group buffer pool. This message is issued once by any DB2 member who
is the page set castout owner on one of the objects being recovered.
System action: Check for the DSNB354I message to verify the completion of the automatic recovery process.
DSNB354I csect-name ASYNCHRONOUS GRECP RECOVERY HAS COMPLETED FOR GROUP BUFFER POOL bpoolname.
Explanation: DB2 has completed the GRECP recovery process for those GRECP page sets in the group buffer pool
specified in the message. This message is issued once by any DB2 member who previously issued a DSNB353I
message, who is the page set castout owner on one of the objects being recovered.
DSNB357I csect-name AUTOMATIC LPL RECOVERY SUPPRESSED FOR OBJECT TYPE object-type OBJECT NAME object-name REASON reason-type
Explanation: One or more pages in the object that is identified in the message have been added to the logical page
list (LPL). However, DB2 cannot initiate automatic LPL recovery due to an environmental condition that prevents
automatic LPL recovery.
The object could be a table space, an index space, or a partition within a table space or an index space that is
identified by the object-type. object-name identifies the name.
If the object is a table space or an index space, the format of the name is dbname.spacename. If the object is a partition
within a table space or an index space, the format of the name is dbname.spacename.partnumber. dbname is the database
name. spacename is the table space or the index space name. partnumber is the partition number.
reason indicates the condition that prevents DB2 from being able to initiate automatic LPL recovery. Here is a list of
the potential values for reason:
DASD DB2 encountered a DASD I/O error.
RESTART
DB2 is in Restart or End_Restart mode.
GBP DB2 Group Buffer Pool structure failure or 100% loss of connectivity.
System action: The Automatic LPL Recovery is not initiated.
Programmer response: Check the reason that is specified to solve the system condition. To recover the LPL page,
perform one of the following actions:
v Issue the START DATABASE command with the SPACENAM option
v Run the RECOVER or LOAD utility with REPLACE keyword.
DSNB401I BUFFERPOOL NAME bp-name, BUFFERPOOL ID bp-id, USE COUNT use-count

BUFFER POOL SIZE = pool-size BUFFERS
The user-specified buffer pool size.
AUTOSIZE = autosize
The buffer pool AUTOSIZE attribute that is applicable to the current allocation of the buffer pool.
YES The buffer pool uses Workload Manager (WLM) services, if available, to automatically adjust the
size of the buffer pool. The size is adjusted based on dynamic monitoring of the workload goals
and the storage that is available on the system.
NO The buffer pool does not use WLM services for automatic sizing adjustment of buffer pools.
ALLOCATED = allocated-buffers
The number of allocated buffers in an active buffer pool.
TO BE DELETED = delete-buffers
The number of buffers to be deleted in an active buffer pool because of pool contraction.
IN-USE/UPDATED = current-buffers
The number of currently active buffers in the buffer pool. These buffers cannot be stolen.
 DSNB404I: Threshold information:
The information about allocation status is followed by information about the user-modifiable thresholds for the buffer
pool.
 DSNB404I - THRESHOLDS -
VP SEQUENTIAL = vpseq
DEFERRED WRITE = dwt
VERTICAL DEFERRED WRT = dwv1,dwv2

spseq The sequential steal threshold for the simulated pool, expressed as a percentage of the total simulated buffer
pool size.
dwt The free-buffer deferred write threshold for the buffer pool, expressed as a percentage of the total buffer
pool size.
dwv1 The vertical deferred write threshold for the buffer pool, expressed as a percentage of the total buffer pool
size.
dwv2 The vertical deferred write threshold for the buffer pool, expressed as an absolute number of buffers. dwv2 is
used to determine the threshold only if dwv1 is 0 and dwv2 is non-zero. Otherwise, dwv1 is used to
determine the threshold.
vppseqt The sequential threshold for parallel query processing, expressed as a percentage of the virtual sequential
steal threshold. When the threshold is set to 0, parallel query processing is not supported.
vpxpseqt
The assisting parallel sequential threshold, expressed as a percentage of the sequential threshold for parallel
query processing. Use the vpxpseqt value to control how much buffer resource is used when this DB2
member is assisting another member of the group in parallel processing. When the threshold is set to 0, this
buffer pool is not used to assist other data-sharing members in processing a query. In a non-data- sharing
environment, this value is ignored.

System action: After this message is issued, DB2 quiesces all current activities against this buffer pool. DB2 locks
the table space exclusively and performs physical close for all open table spaces or index spaces that reference this
pool. DB2 also prevents subsequent database access that references this pool. SQL applications get an SQLCODE -904
(resource not available) with reason code 00C200E0 to indicate that the requested buffer pool size is not initialized.
After the requested buffer pool is deleted, message DSNB521I is issued.
DSNB521I BUFFER POOL bpname HAS BEEN EXPLICITLY DELETED
Explanation: This message is issued after an active buffer pool is explicitly deleted with an ALTER BUFFERPOOL
command. This message is always preceded by a corresponding DSNB520I message.
System action: The virtual storage that is associated with this buffer pool is released.
DSNB522I VPSIZE FOR bp-name HAS BEEN SET TO specified-value
Explanation: This message is issued in response to an ALTER BUFFERPOOL command to indicate that the
requested change to the VPSIZE parameter was accepted. For an active pool, the actual expansion, contraction, or
deletion does not take place until after this message is issued.
bp-name
The name of the buffer pool.
specified-value
The value that was specified in the command.
System action: Processing continues.
System programmer response: Issue the DISPLAY BUFFERPOOL command to determine the actual virtual storage
usage for this pool.
DSNB524I VPSEQT FOR bpname HAS BEEN SET TO integer
Explanation: This message is issued in response to an ALTER BUFFERPOOL command. It indicates the successful
modification of the sequential steal threshold of the buffer pool.
DSNB526I DWQT FOR bpname HAS BEEN SET TO integer
Explanation: This message is issued in response to an ALTER BUFFERPOOL command. It indicates the successful
modification of the deferred write threshold of the buffer pool.
DSNB527I VDWQT FOR bpname HAS BEEN SET TO int1,int2
Explanation: This message is issued in response to an ALTER BUFFERPOOL command. It indicates the successful
modification of the vertical deferred write threshold of the buffer pool.
DSNB529I VPPSEQT FOR bpname HAS BEEN SET TO integer
Explanation: This message is issued in response to the ALTER BUFFERPOOL command. It indicates the successful
modification of the parallel sequential steal threshold of the buffer pool.
DSNB530I integer IS THE CURRENT VPPSEQT FOR BUFFER POOL bpname
Explanation: An ALTER BUFFERPOOL command specified a VPPSEQT equal to the current parallel sequential steal
threshold of the buffer pool.
System action: The parallel sequential steal threshold of the buffer pool is not changed. Processing for other
parameters, if requested, proceeds normally.
DSNB531I VPPSEQT FOR bpname MUST BE BETWEEN 0 AND 100
Explanation: An ALTER BUFFERPOOL command was issued to alter a buffer pool's VPPSEQT attribute to an
invalid value. VPPSEQT is the parallel sequential steal threshold of the buffer pool. Valid values range from 0 to 100.
System action: The VPPSEQT value is not changed.
System programmer response: Change the VPPSEQT attribute to a valid value and reenter the command.
DSNB532I VPXPSEQT FOR bpname HAS BEEN SET TO integer
Explanation: This message is issued from DSNB1ABP csect in response to the ALTER BUFFERPOOL command. It
indicates the successful modification of the assisting parallel sequential threshold of the buffer pool.
DSNB533I integer IS THE CURRENT VPXPSEQT FOR BUFFER POOL bpname
Explanation: An ALTER BUFFERPOOL command specified a VPXPSEQT equal to the current assisting parallel
sequential threshold of the buffer pool.
System action: The assisting parallel sequential threshold of the buffer pool is not changed. Processing for other
parameters, if requested, proceeds normally.
DSNB534I VPXPSEQT FOR bpname MUST BE BETWEEN 0 AND 100
Explanation: An ALTER BUFFERPOOL command was issued to change a buffer pool's VPXPSEQT attribute to an
invalid value. VPXPSEQT is the assisting parallel sequential threshold of the virtual buffer pool. Valid values range
from 0 to 100. This message is issued from DSNB1ABP csect.
System action: The VPXPSEQT value is not changed.
System programmer response: Change the VPXPSEQT attribute to a valid value and reenter the command.
DSNB536I csect-name THE TOTAL VIRTUAL BUFFER POOL STORAGE EXCEEDS THE REAL STORAGE CAPACITY
Explanation: This message is issued as a warning that the total amount of allocated virtual buffer pool storage for
this DB2 subsystem has exceeded the real storage capacity of the z/OS image. The amount of real storage should be
at least as much as the total amount of virtual buffer pool storage, and should also be enough to accommodate the
EDM pool and DB2 working storage in addition to the virtual buffer pool storage. Paging activity in the buffers is an
indication of a performance problem.
System action: Processing continues.
System programmer response: Allocate more real storage to the z/OS image. If there is not enough real storage to
hold the buffers, then the number of buffers needs to be reduced. This might mean fewer concurrent users. If the
number of buffers is reduced, then DB2 will issue the DSNB538I message when the total amount of virtual buffer
pool storage no longer exceeds the real storage capacity.
DSNB538I csect-name THE TOTAL BUFFER POOL STORAGE NO LONGER EXCEEDS THE REAL STORAGE CAPACITY
Explanation: This message is issued following a previous DSNB536I message to indicate that the total amount of
allocated buffer pool storage for this DB2 subsystem no longer exceeds the real storage capacity of the z/OS image.
System action: Processing continues.
DSNB539I csect-name AUTOLPL FOR bpname HAS BEEN SET TO value. IT WILL TAKE EFFECT ON THE NEXT ALLOCATION
Explanation: DB2 issues this message in response to an ALTER BUFFERPOOL command to ind that the requested
change to the AUTOLPL parameter was accepted. The new AUTOLPL value takes effect the next time the buffer pool
is allocated.
bpname is the name of the buffer pool.
value is one of the following:
YES DB2 automatically recovers pages that are in LPL status.
NO DB2 does not automatically recover pages in LPL status. To recover the LPL page, perform one of the
following actions:
v Issue the START DATABASE command with the SPACENAM option
v Run the RECOVER or LOAD utility
System action: Processing continues
DSNB540I csect-name INSUFFICIENT LOCAL CACHE VECTOR STORAGE TO EXPAND BUFFER POOL bpname TO SPECIFIED SIZE size1. BUFFER POOL SIZE IS NOW size2.
Explanation: The specified buffer pool could not be expanded to the requested size (size1). The associated group
buffer pool is connected, and the local cache vector could not be expanded to cover the requested buffer pool size.
The local cache vector is a bit array which tracks whether the page in a given buffer was modified by another system
(cross-invalidated). There must be one bit in the vector for each buffer in the buffer pool. For more information on
the local cache vector, see MVS/ESA Programming: Sysplex Services Reference.
System action: DB2 downgrades the expansion request to the size that can be supported by the available local cache
vector storage (size2).
System programmer response: Free local cache vector storage by contracting or deleting other buffer pools that are
connected to a group buffer pool. Then reattempt the pool expansion by reissuing the ALTER BUFFERPOOL
command.
DSNB541I csect-name THE TOTAL ACTIVE PGFIX YES BUFFER POOL STORAGE EXCEEDS THE DB2 ALLOWED REAL STORAGE CAPACITY WHEN ALLOCATING STORAGE FOR BUFFER POOL bpname REAL STORAGE CAPACITY = rsc MB.
Explanation: When allocating storage for a PGFIX YES buffer pool, DB2 detects that the total storage allocated for
the PGFIX YES buffer pools will exceed 80% of the real storage capacity on this z/OS image. The buffer pool name
identified on this message (bpname) will be allocated with the PGFIX NO attribute. The real storage capacity of this
z/OS image (rsc) is displayed in this message in units of megabytes (1 MB = 2**20 bytes).
System action: The buffer pool is created using the PGFIX NO attribute.
System programmer response: Either allocate more real storage to this z/OS image, reduce the requested size of the
buffer pool or use the PGFIX NO attribute.

DSNB542I csect-name THE TOTAL ACTIVE PGFIX YES BUFFER POOL STORAGE EXCEEDS THE DB2 ALLOWED REAL STORAGE CAPACITY WHEN EXPANDING STORAGE FOR BUFFER POOL bpname CURRENT VPSIZE = cbpsize NEW VPSIZE = nbpsize REAL STORAGE CAPACITY = rsc MB.
Explanation: When expanding the VPSIZE for an active PGFIX YES buffer pool, DB2 detects that the total storage
allocated for all active PGFIX YES buffer pools will exceed 80% of the real storage capacity on this z/OS image. The
ALTER BUFFERPOOL command fails and the buffer pool will continue to be active with the current VPSIZE value.
The buffer pool attributes and real storage capacity are:
bpname
The buffer pool name.
cbpsize
The current VPSIZE for the buffer pool.
nbpsize
The new VPSIZE that was specified on the ALTER BUFFERPOOL command.
rsc The real storage capacity of this z/OS image in units of megabytes (1 MB = 2**20 bytes).
System action: The ALTER BUFFERPOOL command fails. The buffer pool continues to be active with the current
VPSIZE.
System programmer response: Either allocate more real storage to this z/OS image, reduce the requested size of the
buffer pool or use the PGFIX NO attribute.
DSNB543I THE PGFIX ATTRIBUTE IS ALTERED FOR BUFFER POOL bp-name CURRENT ATTRIBUTE = cpgfix NEW ATTRIBUTE = npgfix THE NEW ATTRIBUTE IS IN PENDING STATE.
Explanation: An ALTER BUFFERPOOL command requested a change to the PGFIX attribute and the changes was
accepted. The new value will take effect the next time the buffer pool is allocated.
bp-name
The buffer pool name.
current-attribute
The current PGFIX value for the buffer pool.
new-attribute
The new PGFIX value that was specified on the ALTER BUFFERPOOL command.

DSNB544I AUTOSIZE FOR bpname HAS BEEN SET TO nasize
Explanation: This message is issued in response to an ALTER BUFFERPOOL command to indicate that the
requested change to the AUTOSIZE attribute has been accepted.
bpname The buffer pool name.
nasize The new AUTOSIZE value specified in the ALTER BUFFERPOOL command, either YES or NO.
System action: Processing continues.
DSNB551I BSDS READ ERROR, RC= integer, RSN=integer
Explanation: This message is issued in response to a failure of a READ function on the bootstrap data set (BSDS).
Users should check any previous error messages issued by MVS and DB2 against the corresponding BSDS. RC and
RSN indicate an error return code and reason code from the BSDS function.
System action: Processing continues.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Analyze the return and reason codes to determine what type of error occurred. Refer
to message DSNJ107I for more information.
DSNB552I BSDS WRITE ERROR, RC= integer, RSN= integer
Explanation: This message is issued in response to a failure of a WRITE function on the bootstrap data set (BSDS).
Check any previous error messages issued by MVS and DB2 against the corresponding BSDS. RC and RSN indicate
an error return code and reason code from the BSDS function.
System action: Processing continues.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Analyze the return and reason codes to determine what type of error occurred. Refer
to message DSNJ108I for more information.
DSNB553I BSDS INSERT ERROR, RC= integer, RSN= integer
Explanation: This message is issued in response to a failure of an INSERT function on the bootstrap data set (BSDS).
Check any previous error messages issued by MVS and DB2 against the corresponding BSDS. RC and RSN indicate
an error return code and reason code from the BSDS function.
System action: Processing continues.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Analyze the return and reason codes to determine what type of error occurred. For
more information, refer to message DSNJ109I or other DSNJ messages related to BSDS.
DSNB555I WLM RECOMMENDATION TO ADJUST SIZE FOR BUFFER POOL bpname HAS COMPLETED OLD SIZE = csize BUFFERS NEW SIZE = nsize BUFFERS
Explanation: This message is issued when Workload Manager (WLM) notifies DB2 to adjust the size of a buffer
pool. This recommendation is made based on WLM's dynamic monitoring of the effects of buffer pool I/O on the
achievement of workload goals, and also on the amount of available storage on the system. This message is issued
after the adjustment has completed.
bpname The buffer pool name.
csize The old size of the buffer pool.
nsize The new size of the buffer pool.
System action: Processing continues.
DSNB601I BUFFER POOL bpname FULL
Explanation: A buffer is required to access a database page that is not currently contained within the buffer pool. A
buffer cannot be assigned because all buffers in the buffer pool are in a nondisplaceable state. (Buffers are in a
nondisplaceable state when they contain actively referenced pages or updated pages for which writes are pending.)
This message can occur if there is an overload of concurrent activity for the buffer pool size. The variable bpname is
the buffer pool external name.
System action: Reason code 00C200E9 and the buffer pool external name are recorded in the cursor table (CT),
which is available in the SQL communication area (SQLCA) or messages. An SQLCODE -904 (resource not available)
is returned to the user.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Do one of the following:
v Reduce concurrent activity by reducing the number of DB2 threads.
v Use the ALTER BUFFERPOOL command to increase the size of the buffer pool.
DSNB602I UNABLE TO CREATE BUFFER POOL bpname. BUFFER POOL SIZE IS ZERO
Explanation: An attempt to create the buffer pool failed while opening a DB2 table space or index that specified its
use. The buffer pool size for bpname was zero. This indicates that the use of the pool is invalid.
System action: Reason code 00C200E0 and the buffer pool external name are recorded in the cursor table (CT),
which is available in the SQL communication area (SQLCA) or messages. An SQLCODE -904 (resource not available)
is returned to the user.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Use the ALTER TABLESPACE or ALTER INDEX statement to modify affected table
spaces or indexes to indicate a usable buffer pool. Use the DISPLAY BUFFERPOOL command to determine a usable
buffer pool. If necessary, use the ALTER BUFFERPOOL command to activate the failing buffer pool by setting its
VPSIZE to a nonzero value.
DSNB603I INSUFFICIENT STORAGE TO CREATE/EXPAND BUFFER POOL bpname TO SPECIFIED SIZE integer. BUFFER POOL SIZE IS NOW integer.
Explanation: A buffer pool could not be created or expanded to the requested size. Insufficient storage exists within
the ssnmDBM1 address space to build the buffer pool. The buffer pool size is set by the ALTER BUFFERPOOL
command and can be queried by using the DISPLAY BUFFERPOOL command.
System action: The buffer pool is created or expanded to the size allowed by the available storage. If the buffer pool
cannot be created at all, and the creation request was triggered by a page set open by an application, then an
SQLCODE -904 (resource not available) is returned to the user. Reason code 00C200E8 and the buffer pool external
name are recorded in the cursor table (CT), which is available in the SQL communication area (SQLCA) or messages.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Analyze the storage content of the ssnmDBM1 address space to determine further
action. If appropriate, use the ALTER TABLESPACE or ALTER INDEX statement to use a different buffer pool.
Otherwise, use ALTER BUFFERPOOL commands to balance storage use for all buffer pools.
DSNB605I UNABLE TO CREATE BUFFER POOL bpname TO SPECIFIED SIZE DURING STARTUP/RESTART.  INSUFFICIENT VIRTUAL STORAGE
Explanation: An attempt to create the buffer pool failed at the time that DB2 was performing its startup or restart
processing. Insufficient virtual storage exists within the ssnmDBM1 address space for building the buffer pool. The
name of the buffer pool is bpname.
System action: The buffer pool is not created. The table space or index open request, which triggered the attempt to
create the buffer pool, fails. An SQLCODE -904 (resource not available) is returned to the user. Reason code 00C200E8
and the buffer pool external name are recorded in the cursor table (CT), which is available in the SQL communication
area (SQLCA) or messages.
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer. This message remains on the console until the operator deletes
it.
System programmer response: Analyze the virtual storage content of the DSNDBM1 ssnmDBM1 address space to
determine further action. If appropriate, use ALTER BUFFERPOOL commands to balance virtual storage use for all
buffer pools.
DSNB609I VIRTUAL BUFFER POOL bpname CREATED USING DEFAULT SIZE DURING STARTUP/RESTART.  VIRTUAL BUFFER POOL SIZE IS ZERO
Explanation: While activating a buffer pool during DB2 startup or restart processing, the buffer pool size was zero.
A zero value might be caused by an unusable bootstrap data set (BSDS) or by a DB2 abnormal termination after
buffer pool size was altered to zero. The name of the buffer pool is bpname.
System action: DB2 creates the buffer pool using the startup restart default value.
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer. This message remains on the console until deleted by the
operator.
System programmer response: Use the ALTER TABLESPACE or ALTER INDEX statement to modify the affected
table spaces or indexes to indicate a usable buffer pool. To determine a usable buffer pool, use the DISPLAY
BUFFERPOOL command. If necessary, use the ALTER BUFFERPOOL command to activate the failing buffer pool by
setting the VPSIZE to a nonzero value.
DSNB610I csect-name MAXIMUM ALLOCATABLE BUFFER POOL STORAGE OF int1MB HAS BEEN REACHED. UNABLE TO CREATE/EXPAND BUFFER POOL bp-name TO SPECIFIED SIZE int2.  BUFFER POOL IS NOW int3
Explanation: A buffer pool could not be created or expanded to the requested size. The maximum amount of
allowable buffer pool storage, indicated by int1, has been reached. The maximum allowable buffer pool storage is
calculated to be twice the amount of real storage that is available on the z/OS image, or 1TB, whichever is less.
bpname
Indicates the name of the buffer pool that was affected.
int2 Indicates the size of the buffer pool that was requested.
int3 Indicates the actual size of the buffer pool that was created/expanded.
System action: The buffer pool is created or expanded to the size allowed by the available storage within the
maximum. If the maximum has already been reached, then the buffer pool is allocated at a minimum size as follows:
v 2,000 pages for 4K page size
v 1,000 pages for 8K page size
v 500 pages for 16K page size
v 250 pages for 32K page size
Once the maximum has been reached, buffer pool sizes are not allowed to be increased.
System programmer response: Analyze the buffer pool sizes and determine if any can be decreased, or consider
adding more memory.
DSNB740I csect-name ATTEMPTING TO ESTABLISH DUPLEXING FOR GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname REASON = reason
Explanation: DB2 has been requested to establish duplexing for the named group buffer pool. reason indicates the
reason why duplexing was initiated. reason can be one of the following:
OPERATOR
The operator initiated a SETXCF command to initiate duplexing.
POLICY
The currently active CFRM policy indicated that duplexing should be automatically established for the
group buffer pool.
This message is issued by each DB2 member participating in establishing duplexing.
System action: The DB2 members that are actively connected to the named group buffer pool participate in
establishing duplexing for the group buffer pool. Access to the group buffer pool is quiesced while duplexing is
being established.
DSNB741I csect-name DUPLEXING COULD NOT BE ESTABLISHED FOR GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname REASON = reason
Explanation: DB2 was unable to establish duplexing for the named group buffer pool. reason indicates the DB2
reason code indicating why duplexing could not be established.
System action: The group buffer pool goes back to simplex mode.
System programmer response: See the explanation for the reason code given.
DSNB742I csect-name DUPLEXING HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ESTABLISHED FOR GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname
Explanation: The process to establish duplexing for the named group buffer pool has successfully completed.
This message is preceded by message DSNB740I which indicates the reason why duplexing was initiated. This
message is issued by each DB2 member participating in establishing duplexing.
System action: Processing of mainline requests is resumed for the group buffer pool. Writes of changed pages to the
group buffer pool will be duplexed writes from this point forward.
DSNB743I csect-name DUPLEXING IS BEING STOPPED FOR GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname FALLING BACK TO PRIMARY REASON = reason1 DB2 REASON CODE = reason2
Explanation: Duplexing is being stopped for the named group buffer pool. To stop the duplexing, the secondary
group buffer pool will be deallocated, and DB2 will go back to simplex mode on the primary group buffer pool.
reason1 indicates why duplexing was stopped:
OPERATOR
The operator initiated an MVS command to stop duplexing.
POLICY
A new CFRM policy has been activated which specifies DUPLEX(DISABLED) for the group buffer pool.
LOSSCONNSEC
One or more of the DB2 members lost connectivity to the secondary group buffer pool structure.
STRFAILSEC
The secondary group buffer pool structure failed.
DB2REASON
DB2 decided to stop duplexing. The reason code given in reason2 indicates why DB2 stopped duplexing.
DUPCONNCHG
Duplexing rebuild stopped because of insufficient connectivity due to a change in the set of connectors.
If reason1 indicates 'DB2REASON', then reason2 specifies a DB2 reason code that indicates why DB2 stopped
duplexing. If reason1 is not 'DB2REASON', then reason2 is zero.
This message is issued by each DB2 member connected to the duplexed group buffer pool.
System action: The secondary group buffer pool structure is discarded, and DB2 enters back into simplex mode on
the primary group buffer pool structure. If DUPLEX(AUTO) is specified in the active CFRM policy for the group
buffer pool, then duplexing will be automatically reinitiated, if duplexing is still possible.
System programmer response: If the rebuild stopped because of DB2REASON, see the explanation for the reason
code given. If duplexing is not automatically reinitiated and duplexing is needed for the group buffer pool, then use
the MVS SETXCF command to reestablish duplexing.
DSNB744I csect-name DUPLEXING IS BEING STOPPED FOR GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname, SWITCHING TO SECONDARY REASON = reason1 DB2 REASON CODE = reason2
Explanation: Duplexing is being stopped for the named group buffer pool. To stop the duplexing, the primary
group buffer pool will be deallocated, and DB2 will switch to the secondary group buffer pool to go back to simplex
mode.
reason1 indicates why duplexing was stopped:
OPERATOR
The operator initiated an MVS command to stop duplexing.
POLICY
A new CFRM policy has been activated which specifies DUPLEX(DISABLED) for the group buffer pool.
LOSSCONNPRI
One or more of the DB2 members lost connectivity to the primary group buffer pool structure.
STRFAILPRI
The primary group buffer pool structure failed.
DB2REASON
DB2 decided to stop duplexing. The reason code given in reason2 indicates why DB2 stopped duplexing.
If reason1 indicates 'DB2REASON', then reason2 specifies a DB2 reason code that indicates why DB2 stopped
duplexing. If reason1 is not 'DB2REASON', then reason2 is zero.
This message is issued by each DB2 member connected to the duplexed group buffer pool.
System action: The primary group buffer pool structure is discarded, and DB2 enters back into simplex mode on
the secondary group buffer pool structure. If DUPLEX(ENABLED) is specified in the active CFRM policy for the
group buffer pool, then duplexing will be automatically reinitiated, if duplexing is still possible.
System programmer response: If the rebuild stopped because of DB2REASON, see the explanation for the reason
code given. If duplexing is not automatically reinitiated and duplexing is needed for the group buffer pool, then use
the MVS SETXCF command to reestablish duplexing.
DSNB745I csect-name THE TRANSITION BACK TO SIMPLEX MODE HAS COMPLETED FOR GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname
Explanation: The named group buffer pool has completed the transition from duplex mode back to simplex mode.
This message is preceded either by message DSNB743I or by message DSNB744I which indicates the reason why
duplexing was stopped. This message is issued by each DB2 member connected to the group buffer pool.
System action: The group buffer pool is now back in simplex mode which means that writes of changed pages to
the group buffer pool are now simplexed. If DUPLEX(ENABLED) is specified in the active CFRM policy for the
group buffer pool, then duplexing will be automatically reinitiated, if duplexing is still possible. This would mean
that the group buffer pool is only temporarily back into simplex mode (it is soon to be entered back into duplex
mode).
DSNB749I GBPCACHE NO IS NOT ALLOWED FOR GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname BECAUSE IT IS DUPLEXED
Explanation: This message is issued in response to an ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command that requests a
change of the GBPCACHE attribute from YES to NO, but because the group buffer pool is duplexed, the change from
YES to NO is not allowed.
System action: The request to change from GBPCACHE(YES) to GBPCACHE(NO) is rejected.
System programmer response: GBPCACHE(NO) and duplexing are mutually exclusive. If you want
GBPCACHE(NO), then you must put the group buffer in simplex mode before specifying GBPCACHE(NO). To put a
duplexed group buffer pool in simplex mode, do any of the following procedures:
v Activate a new CFRM policy that specifies DUPLEX(DISABLED) for the group buffer pool. This is the preferred
method if you do not intend to duplex the group buffer pool again for awhile.
v Ensure that DUPLEX(AUTO) is not specified in the active CFRM policy for the group buffer pool, and then issue
the MVS command SETXCF STOP,REBUILD,DUPLEX.
DSNB750I DISPLAY FOR GROUP BUFFER POOL gbpname FOLLOWS
Explanation: This message displays output from the DISPLAY GROUPBUFFERPOOL command.
Related information:
-DISPLAY GROUPBUFFERPOOL (DB2) (DB2 Commands)

Message DSNB751I is displayed if DB2 could not retrieve the z/OS CFRM administrative policy information for
the group buffer pool. Either the z/OS query request (IXCQUERY) did not successfully complete, or the backing
structure for the group buffer pool is not defined in the z/OS CFRM administrative policy. Therefore, the
information that is displayed for the group buffer pool is incomplete. For example, if the IXCQUERY request did
not complete successfully, a connection list is not displayed, even if the CONNLIST option was specified on the
DISPLAY GROUPBUFFERPOOL command.
gbpname
The name of the group buffer pool.
retcode The return code from IXCQUERY.
reason The reason code from IXCQUERY.

secondary-gbpname
The secondary group buffer pool name. This name is the primary group buffer pool name (such as GBP0)
suffixed with -SEC.
s2 The number of times that a write request from the coupling facility did not complete because the secondary
group buffer pool did not have enough storage.
s3 The number of times that DB2 checked whether a changed page was written to the secondary group buffer
pool, but the write operation was not yet complete. Thus, the transaction had to wait until the write to the
secondary group buffer pool completed.
s5 The number of requests to delete from the secondary group buffer pool a set of pages that were recently cast
out from the primary group buffer pool. If the group buffer pool was duplexed for the entire reporting
interval, this number should be roughly equal to the number of UNLOCK CASTOUT requests, as reported
in message DSNB796I.
s6 The number of requests to check for orphaned data entries in the secondary group buffer pool. Orphaned
data entries are changed data entries in the secondary group buffer pool without a corresponding changed
data entry in the primary group buffer pool.
The group buffer pool structure owner periodically issues these requests to determine whether orphaned
data entries in the secondary group buffer pool need to be cleaned up. Orphaned data entries are expected
periodically and do not indicate a data inconsistency problem. Orphaned data entries can be introduced by
certain transaction or system failures or by the unlikely circumstance that new group buffer pool write
activity occurred concurrently with castout processing.
s7 The number of requests to delete orphaned data entries from the secondary group buffer pool. The group
buffer pool structure owner issues these requests if it determines that orphaned data entries need to be
cleaned up.
s8 The number of asynchronous coupling facility requests that were sent to the secondary group buffer pool.
This number excludes the s3 value.

DSNB800I DIRECTORY ENTRY TO DATA PAGE RATIO SET TO value FOR gbpname. IT WILL TAKE EFFECT ON THE NEXT REALLOCATION
Explanation: This message is issued in response to an ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command that requests a
change to the directory entry to the data page ratio for a group buffer pool. It is also issued for the first ALTER
GROUPBUFFERPOOL command for a group buffer pool, even when no ratio value is specified on the command (in
this case, the default ratio value is being used). The new ratio takes effect the next time the coupling facility cache
structure is allocated.
The directory entry to data page ratio determines the number of directory entries and the number of data pages that
are allocated in the coupling facility cache structure for the group buffer pool. If the coupling facility structure is not
allocated, the first connect from any DB2 causes allocation of the structure and the new directory entry to data page
ratio to take effect.
If the structure size can be determined from the MVS CFRM administrative policy, message DSNB801I is issued to
indicate an estimate of the number of directory and data entries that are allocated based on the new ratio and the
current size of the coupling facility structure. Otherwise, message DSNB812I is issued.
System action: Processing continues.
System programmer response: Use the -DISPLAY GROUPBUFFERPOOL command to display the number of
allocated directory and data entries.
DSNB801I MAX STRUCTURE SIZE INDICATED IN MVS CFRM POLICY = size KB ESTIMATED NUMBER OF DIRECTORY ENTRIES = dir# ESTIMATED NUMBER OF DATA PAGES = data#
Explanation: This message is issued in response to an ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command after the directory
entry to data page ratio is successfully updated. It is also issued for the first ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command
for a group buffer pool, even when no ratio value is specified on the command (in this case, the default ratio value is
used). The group buffer pool is identified in message DSNB800I, which immediately precedes this message.
Because the actual ratio change does not take affect until the group buffer pool is reallocated, this message shows the
estimated number of directory entries and data pages that are allocated based on the new ratio and the maximum
size of the coupling facility structure, as indicated in the active CFRM policy definition. The actual number of entries
that are allocated varies based on the amount of coupling facility storage that is available at the time the allocation is
attempted, and on the amount of storage overhead necessary for the coupling facility control structures. Because DB2
cannot determine these variables, the estimated number of directory and data entries displayed in this message
assumes that the entire storage allocation for the coupling facility cache structure will be used for directory and data
entries, which is not the case.
System action: Processing continues.

DSNB802I "value" IS NOT A VALID PARAMETER FOR 'RATIO'
Explanation: An illegal value for the RATIO parameter was specified for an ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL
command. The RATIO value can be up to 6 characters, and must be a decimal number from 1.0 to 255 (inclusive).
For values less than 25, any digits after the first decimal place are ignored. If the value for the RATIO parameter is
greater than or equal to 25, any digits after the decimal point are ignored. Informational message DSNB803I is
displayed if the system ignores any precision that exceeds the limits of the RATIO parameter.
System action: The request is rejected.
System programmer response: Reissue the ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command, and specify an acceptable
value for RATIO.
DSNB803I RATIO IS TRUNCATED TO value
Explanation: The precision specified on the RATIO parameter on an ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command was
greater than allowed. For decimal numbers less than 25, any digits after the first decimal place are ignored: for
example, 5.67 is treated as 5.6. For decimal numbers greater than or equal to 25, any digits after the decimal point are
ignored: for example, 25.3 is treated as 25.
System action: Processing continues.
DSNB804I CLASS CASTOUT THRESHOLD SET TO class-threshold% FOR gbp-name
Explanation: This message is issued in response to an ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command that requests a
change to the class castout threshold value for a group buffer pool. It is also issued for the first ALTER
GROUPBUFFERPOOL command for a group buffer pool, even when no threshold value is specified on the command
(in this case, the default class castout threshold value is used).
class-threshold
The threshold at which class castouts are to be initiated, expressed as a percentage of the group buffer pool
size

DSNB806I GROUP BUFFER POOL CASTOUT THRESHOLD SET TO value% FOR gbpname
Explanation: This message is issued in response to an ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command that successfully
changes the group buffer pool castout threshold value for a group buffer pool. It is also issued for the first successful
ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command for a group buffer pool, even when no threshold value is specified on the
command (in this case, the default group buffer pool castout threshold value is being used).
System action: Processing continues.
DSNB807I value IS NOT A VALID PARAMETER FOR 'GBPOOLT'
Explanation: An ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command was issued with an illegal value specified on the
GBPOOLT (group buffer pool castout threshold) keyword. The GBPOOLT value must be an integer between 0 and
90, inclusive.
System action: The request is rejected.
System programmer response: Reissue the -ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command, specifying an acceptable value
for GBPOOLT.
DSNB808I GROUP BUFFER POOL CHECKPOINT INTERVAL SET TO value MINUTES FOR gbpname
Explanation: This message is issued in response to an ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command that successfully
changes the group buffer pool checkpoint interval value for a group buffer pool. It is also issued for the first
successful ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command for a group buffer pool, even when no interval value is specified
on the command (in this case, the default group buffer pool checkpoint interval value is being used).
System action: Processing continues.
DSNB809I value IS NOT A VALID PARAMETER FOR 'GBPCHKPT'
Explanation: An ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command was issued with an illegal value specified on the
GBPCHKPT (group buffer pool checkpoint) keyword. The GBPCHKPT value must be an integer between 1 and
999999, inclusive.
System action: The request is rejected.
System programmer response: Reissue the -ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command, specifying an acceptable value
for GBPCHKPT.
DSNB812I SIZE ESTIMATES ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE GROUP BUFFER POOL MVS IXCQUERY RETURN CODE = return code MVS IXCQUERY REASON CODE = reason code
Explanation: The directory entries and data pages estimates for the group buffer pool, identified on the preceding DSNB800I message, could not be computed because IXCQUERY was unable to obtain the backing structure's size
information from the MVS CFRM administrative policy definition. This can happen if an IXCQUERY processing error
occurred, or if the structure was not defined in the CFRM policy. The backing structure for the group buffer pool
must be defined in the CFRM policy before the group buffer pool can be allocated. The exact reason can be
determined from the return code and the reason code. For an explanation of the IXCQUERY codes, see MVS/ESA
Programming: Sysplex Services Reference.
System action: The command completes successfully, but without giving the estimates.
DSNB813I csect-name ALTER NOTIFICATION FAILED
Explanation: An ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command failed to propagate the request for castout threshold or
checkpoint interval change to other DB2s in the data sharing group. This error is triggered by an error encountered
by the IRLM notification process. As a result, different DB2s in the group might have different values for the castout
threshold or checkpoint interval. The RATIO change does not use the notification process and is, therefore, not
affected by such a failure.
System action: Processing continues.
System programmer response: Reissue the -ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command with the same parameters. If
the problem persists, it indicates a deeper problem, such as inadequate space for the locking structures.
DSNB814I csect-name NO CHANGES REQUESTED ON COMMAND
Explanation: An ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command without any parameters was issued for an existing group
buffer pool. If an ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command without any parameters is issued for a group buffer pool
that does not yet exist, a group buffer pool definition with default parameters values is created.
System action: The command is successful and processing continues.

Explanation: An invalid name was specified on an ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL or DISPLAY
GROUPBUFFERPOOL command.
name Either the DB2 group buffer pool name or the backing coupling structure name
You must either specify the DB2 group buffer pool name (gpbname) or the backing coupling facility structure name
(strname). Acceptable values for gbpname are GBP0, GBP1, ..., GBP49, GBP32K, GBP32K1, ... , GBP32K9. The strname
has the following format:
groupname_gbpname
The groupname is the DB2 data sharing group name. The underscore (_) is used as a delimiter between the groupname
and the gbpname.
System action: The request is rejected.
System programmer response: Reissue the command specifying a valid group buffer pool name.
DSNB892I grpname IS NOT A VALID GROUP NAME FOR THIS DB2
Explanation: The group name specified as part of the full coupling facility cache structure name on an ALTER
GROUPBUFFERPOOL or DISPLAY GROUPBUFFERPOOL command is incorrect. On the commands, you can specify
either the correct 16-byte coupling facility cache structure name or the DB2 group buffer pool name. The coupling
facility cache structure name is a 16-character name specified as follows:
groupname_gbpname
The gbpname can be GBP0, GBP1, ..., GBP49 GBP32K, GBP32K1, ..., GBP32K9. The groupname is the DB2 data sharing
group name. The underscore (_) is used as a delimiter between the groupname and the gbpname. The coupling facility
cache structure names are left-justified with a blank as the rightmost padding character. DB2 adds the padding
blanks if they are not specified on the command.
System action: The request is rejected.
System programmer response: Reissue the command, specifying a valid group buffer pool name.

incompatibility between itself and DB2. The current release_level of the DSN command processor code and the DB2
subsystem load modules is indicated as a string of three numeric characters as follows:
v Version
v Release
v Modification level
System action: The DSN command processor terminates.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you are unable to determine the problem, you can trace DSN execution through
DB2I or the DSN command processor.
User response: Check that your method of invoking DSN or DB2I allocates the correct libraries for DSN. If you
used JCL or a TSO logon procedure to execute DSN code, check your JOBLIB and STEPLIB allocations. If you used a
CLIST to execute DSN, ensure that you obtained the correct version of the DSN code. See your system programmer if
you invoke DSN using procedures supplied by your system programmer.
Problem determination: Ensure that coexistence is supported on both release levels (DSN and DB2). If coexistence is
supported, ensure that the lower level release has the correct SPE level code support that is required to coexist with
the current higher level release.

If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
DSNE340I INTERNAL ERROR - ILLEGAL TYPE IN MODULE module-name
Explanation: An internal DB2 problem has occurred. The named module has detected a nonexistent SQLTYPE.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
User response: Collect the SPUFI trace and ISPF log, and notify either the system programmer or the database
administrator.
You may have to rerun the failing job after you have turned on trace. This will enable you to send trace messages to
the ISPF log.
DSNE345I WARNING: DB2 DATA CORRUPTION CAN RESULT FROM THIS SPUFI SESSION BECAUSE THE CCSID USED BY THE TERMINAL IS NOT THE SAME AS THE CCSID USED BY SPUFI.  TERMINAL CCSID terminal-ccsid. SPUFI CCSID: spufi-ccsid. NOTIFY THE DB2 SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR.
Explanation: The current SPUFI session was initiated on a TSO terminal that uses a coded character set identifier
(CCSID) of terminal-ccsid. However, SPUFI was bound on the local DB2 server using a CCSID of spufi-ccsid. This
discrepancy can lead to unexpected data conversion, affecting any characters that do not map to the same code point
in the two CCSIDs.
If terminal-ccsid is blank, then the terminal code page and character set cannot be queried or they are not supported
by ISPF. Possible reasons why the terminal code page and character set cannot be queried include:
v Hardware limitation such as use of older terminals
v Improper configuration of the terminal emulator software
v Improper BTAM or control unit setup
A blank spufi-ccsid indicates that SPUFI might have received an unexpected SQLCODE when it attempted to query
the current application encoding scheme. Diagnostics for that SQLCODE appear directly after the DSNE345I message
in the message warning panel.
System action: SPUFI waits for the user to indicate whether to continue or quit.
System programmer response: On the local DB2, SPUFI expects to process only EBCDIC character data encoded in
the CCSID of spufi-ccsid. Ensure that the user's TSO terminal configuration is updated to use a CCSID of spufi-ccsid.
Verify the data integrity of all tables modified during the SPUFI session and follow standard recovery procedures.
Contact IBM for guidance if widespread or long term data corruption is evident (for example, if many users report
this message when using SPUFI).
Special considerations:
Blank CCSIDs
As noted previously, a blank terminal-ccsid setting occurs when the terminal code page and character set
cannot be queried or they are not supported by ISPF. Check for the following situations:
v If the message occurs when using a terminal emulator, verify that the emulator software is configured
with a CCSID setting.
v Check the VTAM? setup: The VTAM logmode entry used to define the session characteristics for the
terminal must have the EDS (extended data stream) bit turned 'on' in the PSERVIC (that is,
pservic=xx80xx..). For more information, consult OS/390 ISPF Planning and Customization and the z/OS
SNA Network Implementation Guide.
v Older terminal hardware such as the IBM 327x series do not support the EDS, so a CCSID cannot be
determined. You can instruct users of such devices to specify in the SPUFI defaults panel that the DSNE345I message should be suppressed. Note that suppression applies only when the terminal CCSID is
blank. You cannot use this field to suppress DSNE345I when terminal-ccsid is non-blank.
A blank spufi-ccsid indicates that SPUFI probably received an unexpected SQLCODE when it attempted to query the
current application encoding scheme. Check the diagnostics for the SQLCODE that is displayed directly after the DSNE345I message, and then respond to the diagnostics accordingly.
User response: Notify the system programmer. Depress the END key to quit or the ENTER key to continue.
Important: Continuing can result in corruption of data stored by DB2.

DSNE346I WARNING: ALL SHIFT-IN AND SHIFT-OUT CHARACTERS IN THE 'FOR BIT DATA' COLUMNS IN THE OUTPUT ABOVE HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY THE SUBSTITUTION CHARACTER '.'
Explanation: The current SQL query returned one or more columns that have a data type of CHAR FOR BIT DATA,
VARCHAR FOR BIT DATA, or both. Also, the current SPUFI session indicates that a graphic character set is being
used. To prevent the possible corruption of outputted data elsewhere in the report, all shift-in (code point x'0E') and
shift-out (code point x'0F') characters will be replaced with a substitution character of '.' (code point x'4B').
System action: SPUFI processing continues.
User response: To avoid the substitution character for shift-in and shift-out data, and in order to see all FOR BIT
DATA in hexadecimal format, go to the SPUFI defaults panel and change the setting of the FOR BIT DATA field from
ASIS to HEX.
DSNE351A EDIT PROCESSING OPTION MUST BE Y (YES) OR N (NO)
Explanation: The user specified an edit option other than 'YES', 'NO', or the abbreviation 'Y' or 'N'. A valid user
response determines whether SPUFI invokes the ISPF editor to allow the user to edit the input data set.
System action: SPUFI will wait until the user enters a valid response.
User response: Type in a 'Y' or an 'N', and press 'ENTER'.
DSNE352A EXECUTE PROCESSING OPTION MUST BE Y (YES) OR N (NO)
Explanation: The user specified an execute option other than 'YES', 'NO', or the abbreviation 'Y' or 'N'. A valid user
response determines whether SPUFI executes the SQL statements in the user input data set.
System action: SPUFI waits until the user enters a valid response.
User response: Type in a 'Y' or an 'N', and press 'ENTER'.
DSNE353A BROWSE PROCESSING OPTION MUST BE Y (YES) OR N (NO)
Explanation: The user specified a browse option other than 'YES', 'NO', or the abbreviation 'Y' or 'N'. A valid user
response determines whether SPUFI invokes ISPF BROWSE to allow the user to browse the output data set.
System action: SPUFI will wait until the user enters a valid response.
User response: Type in a 'Y' or an 'N', and press 'ENTER'.
DSNE354A AUTOCOMMIT PROCESSING OPTION MUST BE Y (YES) OR N (NO)
Explanation: The user specified an AUTOCOMMIT option other than 'YES', 'NO', or the abbreviation 'Y' or 'N'. A
valid user response determines whether SPUFI automatically commits all the changes to the database subsystem.
This was encountered as a result of executing the users SQL statement(s). The commit is done at the end of the
processing of an input data set, if it is requested and if there has been no SQL execution error.
System action: SPUFI waits until the user enters a valid response.
User response: Type in a 'Y' or an 'N', and press 'ENTER'.
DSNE355A CHANGE DEFAULTS PROCESSING OPTION MUST BE Y (YES) OR N (NO)
Explanation: The user specified a change-default option other than 'YES', 'NO', or the abbreviation 'Y' or 'N'. A valid
user response determines whether SPUFI displays the current-session SPUFI defaults and allows the user to change
the defaults.
System action: SPUFI waits until the user enters a valid response.
User response: Type in a 'Y' or an 'N', and press 'ENTER'.
DSNE359A OUTPUT DATA SET NAME REQUIRED FOR EXECUTE OR BROWSE
Explanation: The user did not specify the name of the output data set.
System action: SPUFI waits until the user specifies an output data set.
User response: Type in the correct entry, and press 'ENTER'.
DSNE360A THE OUTPUT DATA SET MUST RESIDE ON DASD
Explanation: The user has attempted to send the output of SPUFI to a SYSOUT data set. He must enter a generic
device class that contains only DASD devices.
System action: SPUFI waits until the user specifies a valid output device class.
User response: Type in the correct entry, and press 'ENTER'.
DSNE361I SPUFI PROCESSING COMPLETE
Explanation: This informational message is displayed after SPUFI successfully created the output data set. If errors
are encountered before the completion of output data set processing, or during the subsequent BROUSE OUTPUT
option for this data set, this message is replaced by either SPUFI or TSO/ISPF error messages.
System action: The system waits for the next user input.
User response: At this point you can change the SPUFI panel variable settings to initiate a new SPUFI request, or
you can exit SPUFI.
DSNE363A ONLY RR (REPEATABLE READ), CS (CURSOR STABILITY), OR UR (UNCOMMITTED READ) ALLOWED
Explanation: The user has entered an invalid isolation level. This value must be one of the following:
v RR
v CS
'Isolation level' here refers to the degree to which the SPUFI user wants to isolate SQL execution from the effects of
other concurrently executing DB2 applications.
RR
If the repeatable read (RR) level is specified and the AUTOCOMMIT option is 'YES', other applications can
modify the selected database values as soon as the SPUFI EXECUTE phase is completed and as soon as the
automatic COMMIT (or ROLLBACK, if an error was encountered) operation is performed. Therefore, it is
possible that the retrieved data being browsed by the user has already been modified by another
application.
If the RR level is specified and the AUTOCOMMIT option is 'NO', then no other DB2 application executing
concurrently can change any of the selected database values until the SPUFI user issues either a COMMIT or
a ROLLBACK. Therefore, other applications might be in a normal wait state while the SPUFI user is
browsing the output data set.
CS
If the cursor stability (CS) level is specified, it does not make any difference whether the AUTOCOMMIT
option is 'YES' or 'NO'. Other concurrently executing DB2 applications can change the selected database
values as soon as the SELECT has completed.
UR
If the uncommitted read (UR) level is specified, SPUFI queries can read data that has been changed, but has
not yet been committed by another application. It does not make any difference whether the
AUTOCOMMIT option is 'YES' or 'NO'. Other concurrently executing DB2 applications can change the
selected database values without waiting for the SELECT to complete.
System action: SPUFI waits until the user specifies a valid isolation level.
User response: Type in the correct entry, and press 'ENTER'.
DSNE364A token IS INVALID AS AN SQL STATEMENT TERMINATOR
Explanation: The user has entered an SQL statement terminator (token) that is not supported. The following values
are not valid for use as a SQL statement terminator:
v blank
v comma
v single and double quotes
v underscore
v left and right parenthesis
System action: The statement cannot be executed.
User response: Specify a valid SQL statement terminator.
DSNE365A SQL STATEMENT TERMINATOR HAS BEEN CHANGED TO token
Explanation: The SPUFI input data set contains a #SET statement that changes the SQL statement terminator to
token.
System action: token is the SQL statement terminator until another #SET statement changes it or the end of the input
data is reached.
DSNE366A ONLY THE LISTED RECFM TYPES ARE ALLOWED
Explanation: The user has entered an invalid record format for the output data set.
System action: The system waits until the user enters one of the allowed RECFM types.
User response: Enter a RECFM of V, VB, VBA, F, FB, or FBA.
DSNE367A ACTION MUST BE C (COMMIT) OR R (ROLLBACK) OR D (DEFER)
Explanation: This message requests the user to make a commit action decision.
User response: To commit all the changes made since the last commit point, enter a 'C'. To undo all the changes that
have been made since the last commit point, enter an 'R'. To defer the decision, enter a blank.
DSNE368A YES OR NO MUST BE ENTERED FOR EACH PROCESSING OPTION
Explanation: One of the processing options was left blank or set to blank by the user.
User response: Enter 'YES' or 'NO' for each processing option.
DSNE370A INPUT DATA SET COULD NOT BE OPENED
Explanation: The input data set could not be opened because of invalid data set attributes. The logical record length
(LRECL) of the input data set must be 80K. The record format (RECFM) must be either F or FB. The input data set
may be either sequential or partitioned.
User response: Specify an input data set having valid attributes.
DSNE371A OUTPUT DATA SET COULD NOT BE OPENED
Explanation: The output data set could not be opened because of invalid data set attributes. The logical record
length (LRECL) must be at least 80KB and less than 32KB. The record format (RECFM) must be F, FB, FBA, V, VB, or
VBA. The output data set must be sequential.
User response: Either specify an output data set having valid attributes, or enter correct attributes for this data set.
DSNE372A OUTPUT DATA SET MUST BE SEQUENTIAL
Explanation: The user has requested that a nonsequential output data set contain the output from execution of SQL
statements.
User response: Enter the data-set-name of a sequential data set for the output data set.
DSNE374A OUTPUT DATA SET MUST BE SEQUENTIAL
Explanation: The output data set is of unrecognized organization. It must be sequential.
System action: Processing does not begin until the panel entries are correct and the user presses 'ENTER'.
User response: The output data set must be sequential. Enter a sequential data-set-name (no member) in the output
data set field.
DSNE375A ACCESS TO INPUT DATA SET NOT AUTHORIZED
Explanation: A local installation-supplied exit has rejected access to the input data set specified by the user.
User response: Either specify the name of a data set for which authorization will be allowed, or arrange to
authorize the original data-set-name. Resubmit the request.
DSNE376A ACCESS TO OUTPUT DATA SET NOT AUTHORIZED
Explanation: A local installation-supplied exit has rejected access to the output data set.
User response: Either specify the name of a data set for which authorization will be allowed, or arrange to
authorize the original data-set-name. Resubmit the request.
DSNE377A INPUT DATA SET RECFM MUST BE F OR FB WITH LRECL 79 OR 80
Explanation: The user specified an input data set that does not have the required attributes (F or FB with LRECL 79
or 80).
Note: If the input data set has an LRECL of 79, SPUFI assumes the data set was exported by QMF?. Therefore, it is
recommended that you should not use an LRECL of 79 for a data set that is not exported from QMF.
User response: Correct the input data set attributes, and try again.
DSNE378A ASA CONTROL CHARACTER NOT ALLOWED ON INPUT DATA SET RECFM
Explanation: The user attempted to use an input data set containing forms control characters or machine control
characters. These characters are not allowed on the input data set.
User response: Remove the forms control characters or machine control characters from the input data set, and try
again.
DSNE379A text from DYNALLOC
Explanation: An attempt to allocate a data set has failed. This message contains the secondary explanation for the
failure.
User response: Correct the condition, and resubmit the subcommand.
DSNE381A UNEXPECTED ALLOCATION RETURN CODE return-code, reason-code
Explanation: An unexpected return code from the z/OS DYNALLOC (SVC 99) service was received.
return-code
The DYNALLOC return code.
reason-code
The reason code that is associated with the return code.
User response: See the DYNALLOC reason and return codes to determine how to correct the condition. Then
resubmit the subcommand.

DSNE383A INVALID OUTPUT DATA SET RECORD FORMAT. OPEN RETURN CODE rcode
Explanation: The data set format was invalid. Acceptable record formats are: F, FB, FBA, V, VB, or VBA.
User response: Enter a valid value in the record format field.
DSNE384A UNEXPECTED DEALLOCATION RETURN CODE return-code, reason-code
Explanation: A deallocation request has returned an unexpected return and reason code.
User response: Refer to the appropriate MVS publication for explanations of the return and reason codes.
DSNE385A ENTER MEMBER NAME. INPUT DATA SET IS PARTITIONED
Explanation: The input data set is partitioned, and the user did not enter the member name on the SPUFI main
menu.
System action: Processing does not begin until the panel entries are correct. If any of the processing options are
changed, this message is ignored, and processing will proceed according to the new settings.
User response: Enter the member name.
DSNE386A MEMBER member-name NOT PRESENT IN SPECIFIED INPUT DATA SET
Explanation: The named member is not in the input data set.
System action: Processing does not begin until the panel entries are correct.
User response: Enter a correct member name or a correct data-set-name.
DSNE387I DSNTIAR ERROR. RETURN CODE = return-code
Explanation: An internal DB2 error has occurred. DSNTIAR attempted to format a message to explain a nonzero
SQL code, but the attempt failed.
System programmer response: Print the ISPF log, and collect a dump of the TSO address space.
User response: Notify the system programmer.

DSNE388A INPUT DATA SET MUST BE SEQUENTIAL OR PARTITIONED
Explanation: The input data set organization is not recognized.
System action: Processing does not begin until the panel entries are correct.
User response: Enter a data-set-name with sequential or partitioned organization. It may be necessary to allocate a
sequential or partitioned data set.
DSNE389A A MEMBER HAS BEEN SPECIFIED FOR A SEQUENTIAL DATA SET
Explanation: The user has specified a member as input to SPUFI. However, the input data set specified is
sequential.
System action: Processing does not begin until the panel entries are correct.
User response: Enter the data-set-name without attempting to specify a member.
DSNE390A THE OUTPUT DATA SET ATTRIBUTES ARE INCONSISTENT
Explanation: This message indicates that the user made one of three possible errors in specifying block size and
logical record length (LRECL):
v The user specified a record format (RECFM) of F, but the block size is not equal to the logical record length
(LRECL)
v The user specified a record format (RECFM) of F, FB, or FBA, but block size is not evenly divisible by logical
record length (LRECL).
v The user specified a record format (RECFM) of VB, but the block size is less than logical record length (LRECL) +
4. The user must allow 4 bytes for the block header.
User response: Specify logical record length (LRECL) and block size appropriately on the DSNESP02 panel.
DSNE391I FREEMAIN ERROR IN MODULE module-name
Explanation: SPUFI encountered a FREEMAIN error in the specified module.
System action: This message is logged in the ISPF log data set. No abend occurs.
System programmer response: Print the ISPF log, and collect a dump of the TSO address space. If you suspect an
error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem,
see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: Notify the system programmer or system administrator.
DSNE392I GETMAIN ERROR IN MODULE module-name
Explanation: SPUFI encountered a GETMAIN error in the specified module.
System action: This message is logged in the ISPF log data set. User abend X'00C50003' is issued.
System programmer response: Ensure that enough storage is allocated to the TSO user.
User response: Notify the system programmer or system administrator.
DSNE393I SPF VDELETE ERROR IN MODULE DSNESM90. ERROR CODE = flag
Explanation: An internal SPUFI error has occurred. CSECT DSNESM90 tried to delete an ISPF dialog variable that
was not previously defined.
System action: This message is logged in the ISPF log data set. No abend is issued. However, if the problem
persists, notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Record the error code 'flag'. It has no user significance, but it can assist the IBM Support
Center in resolving the problem.
DSNE395I UNEXPECTED RETURN CODE FROM SPF SERVICE
Explanation: A return code of 4 from ISPF DISPLAY or a return code of 8 from the ISPF editor was encountered.
System action: The message is displayed on the SPUFI panel and logged in the ISPF log data set. No user abend is
issued.
System programmer response: If a new release of ISPF is used, determine whether the above return codes are now
assigned meaning by ISPF.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: This message may be issued if a previously unassigned (by ISPF) return code from the ISPF
DISPLAY or EDIT function is encountered. If a new release of ISPF is used, determine whether the above return
codes are now assigned meaning by ISPF.
DSNE396A YOU CANNOT SPECIFY DEFER WHEN LEAVING SPUFI
Explanation: You have attempted to leave SPUFI with outstanding database changes not yet committed or rolled
back. You cant leave SPUFI unless a decision has been made to commit or rollback.
System action: The system is waiting for new input to the panel.
User response: Specify COMMIT or ROLLBACK.
DSNE601I SQL STATEMENTS ASSUMED TO BE BETWEEN COLUMNS nn AND nn
Explanation: This message indicates which record columns in the input data set are scanned for SQL statements. For
data sets of type COBOL, columns 8 through 72 are scanned. For STANDARD data set types, if the LRECL is 79 then
columns 1 through 71 are scanned, and if the LRECL is 80 then columns 1 through 72 are scanned.
System action: This message is written to the SPUFI output data set along with other summary messages.
DSNE603E INPUT STATEMENT HAS UNBALANCED APOSTROPHES
Explanation: An opening apostrophe was detected in an input record, but the end of data set was reached before a
closing apostrophe was encountered.
System action: SPUFI processing stops. Correct the error, and start again.
User response: A closing apostrophe was probably omitted from a literal value. Add the missing apostrophe, and
execute the input file again.
DSNE604E THE SQL STATEMENT EXCEEDS THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED LENGTH
Explanation: This message indicates that the preceding SQL statement in the output data set exceeds the maximum
length allowed. An SQL statement may span up to a maximum of 29127 input records.
System action: SPUFI processing stops. Correct the error, and start again.
User response: Edit the SQL statement in question so that it resides on fewer input records.
DSNE605E THE INPUT DATA SET IS EMPTY
Explanation: The user has specified an input data set that does not contain any valid SQL statements.
System action: SPUFI processing stops. Correct the error, and start again.
User response: Edit SQL statements into the specified data set, or specify another input data set that contains valid
SQL statements.
DSNE606E INVALID USE OF AN SQL STATEMENT TERMINATOR
Explanation: An SQL statement terminator has been used improperly in an SQL input statement. Either two
successive statement terminators were encountered, or a series of blanks followed by a terminator was detected. The
proper use of the SQL statement terminator is to delimit the end of a valid SQL statement.
System action: SPUFI processing stops. Correct the error, and start again.
User response: Remove the extraneous terminator from the input data set.
DSNE607E PREVIOUS INPUT RECORD HAS UNBALANCED SO/SI CHARACTERS
Explanation: A shift out (SO) character was detected in the previous input record with no corresponding shift in (SI)
character in the record. The SO/SI characters delimit a DBCS string in the SPUFI input data set. SPUFI requires that
SO/SI characters be paired within an input record.
System action: SPUFI processing stops.
User response: A closing SI character was probably omitted from a literal value. Add the missing SI character, and
re-execute the input file.
DSNE609E INPUT STATEMENT HAS UNBALANCED QUOTES
Explanation: An opening quote () was detected in an input record, but a corresponding quote was not found at the
end. Two sets of quotes are used to delimit a statement.
System action: SPUFI processing stops.
User response: A closing quote was probably omitted from a literal value. Add the missing quote, and execute the
input file again.
DSNE610I NUMBER OF ROWS DISPLAYED IS nn
Explanation: Execution of an SQL SELECT statement causes one or more rows of data to be displayed. This
message appears in the output data set following the returned data for a SELECT. It gives a count, 'nn', of the
number of rows displayed.
System action: Input data set processing is completed, and this message is included in the SPUFI output.
DSNE611I COLUMN HEADER name FOR COLUMN NUMBER nn WAS TRUNCATED
Explanation: An SQL SELECT statement was executed, but the specified column name, identified by 'nn' in the
message, was truncated. This truncation occurred either because the column name was longer than the remaining
record width or because the name was longer than the user-specified maximum field length.
System action: Input data set processing is completed, and this message is included in the SPUFI output.
User response: If the truncation is caused by insufficient record width, use a larger LRECL for the output data set or
specify fewer data columns to be returned on the SELECT statement.
If the truncation is caused by the user-specified maximum field length setting, use a larger value for this setting.
DSNE612I DATA FOR COLUMN HEADER name COLUMN NUMBER nn WAS TRUNCATED
Explanation: An SQL SELECT statement was executed, but data for the specified column name, identified by 'nn' in
the message, was truncated. This truncation occurred either because the data was longer than the remaining record
width or because the data was longer than the user-specified maximum field length.
System action: Input data set processing is completed, and this message is included in the SPUFI output.
User response: If the truncation is because of insufficient record width, use a larger LRECL for the output data set
or specify fewer data columns be returned on the SELECT statement.
If the truncation is because of the user-specified maximum field length setting, use a larger value for this setting.
DSNE613I OUTPUT LRECL IS TOO SMALL TO DISPLAY THE FOLLOWING COLUMNS:
Explanation: An SQL SELECT statement was executed, but the logical record length of the output data set was not
large enough to display the column names and data values of all returned columns. The columns specified following
this message were not displayed because of insufficient remaining record width.
System action: Input data set processing is completed, and this message is included in the SPUFI output.
User response: This condition can be avoided by using a larger LRECL for the output data set or by specifying that
fewer data columns be returned on the SELECT statement.
DSNE614I AUTOCOMMIT IS NO, NO CHANGES COMMITTED
Explanation: The user delayed committing or rolling back changes made during execution of the input file until
later in the session. This is done by specifying an AUTOCOMMIT option of 'NO'.
System action: Input data set processing is completed, and this message is included in the SPUFI output.
User response: Commit or roll back these changes before ending the session.
DSNE615I NUMBER OF ROWS AFFECTED IS nn
Explanation: This message is written to the output data set following execution of an SQL data change statement, or
REFRESH statement. nn is a count of the number of rows that qualified to be deleted, inserted, or updated by that
statement, excluding rows affected by either triggers or referential integrity constraints. If the previous SQL statement
is a multiple-row FETCH, nn indicates the number of rows fetched.
Note: In the case of a mass delete of a table in a segmented table space, or a delete from a view when neither the
DELETE statement nor the definition of the view included selection criteria, this message will not be displayed. In
these cases, DB2 does not access nor count the individual rows.
System action: Input data set processing is completed, and this message is included in the SPUFI output.
DSNE616I STATEMENT EXECUTION WAS SUCCESSFUL, SQLCODE IS sql-code
Explanation: This message is written to the output data set following the successful execution of an SQL statement
from the input data set. The sql-code value specifies the SQL return code for the statement.
System action: Input data set processing is completed, and this message is included in the SPUFI output.
Related concepts:
SQL codes (DB2 Codes)
DSNE617I COMMIT PERFORMED, SQLCODE IS sql-code
Explanation: When an input file is executed successfully and the user specified an AUTOCOMMIT option of 'YES',
this message is written to the output data set to indicate the status of the COMMIT that was performed. The sql-code
value specifies the SQL return code for the COMMIT.
System action: Input data set processing is completed, and this message is included in the SPUFI output.
Related concepts:
SQL codes (DB2 Codes)
DSNE618I ROLLBACK PERFORMED, SQLCODE IS sql-code
Explanation: When an error is encountered while executing a SPUFI input file, and the user specified an
AUTOCOMMIT option of 'YES', this message will be written to the output data set to indicate the status of the
ROLLBACK that was performed. sql-code specifies the SQL return code for the statement.
System action: Input data set processing is completed, and this message is included in the SPUFI output.
Related concepts:
SQL codes (DB2 Codes)
DSNE620I NUMBER OF SQL STATEMENTS PROCESSED IS nn
Explanation: This message is written to the output data set after processing all SQL statements in the current input
data set. The term 'nn' is a count of the number of SQL statements processed.
System action: Input data set processing is completed, and this message is included in the SPUFI output.
DSNE621I NUMBER OF INPUT RECORDS READ IS nn
Explanation: This message is written to the output data set after processing all SQL statements in the current input
data set. The term 'nn' is a count of the total number of records read from the input data set.
System action: Input data set processing is completed, and this message is included in the SPUFI output.
DSNE622I NUMBER OF OUTPUT RECORDS WRITTEN IS nn
Explanation: This message is written to the output data set after processing all SQL statements in the current input
data set. The term 'nn' is a count of the total number of records written to the output data set.
System action: Input data set processing is completed, and this message is included in the SPUFI output.
DSNE623I SYNTAX ERROR AT RECORD xx, OFFSET xx
Explanation: A syntax error was detected in the SQL statement preceding this message in the output data set. 'xx'
identifies the erroneous line number in the SQL statement, and 'yy' identifies the offset (in characters) of the error
within that record.
System action: Input data set processing is completed, and this message is included in the SPUFI output.
User response: Correct the specified syntax error in the input data set, and execute the job again.
DSNE624I UNABLE TO LOAD ISPLINK MODULE. SPUFI PROCESSING TERMINATED
Explanation: During SPUFI initialization processing, an error was encountered attempting to LOAD the ISPF
interface module, ISPLINK. This module could not be located in the LNKLST or STEPLIB library concatenation.
System action: SPUFI processing is terminated.
User response: Rearrange your library concatenation so that the ISPLINK module can be located. This module

DSNE953I csect-name PRECISION OF DECIMAL COLUMN colname EXCEEDS THE MAXIMUM PRECISION FOR THE lang LANGUAGE.
Explanation: DCLGEN was building a COBOL or PL/I language declaration for a table when it encountered a
decimal column with a precision greater than the precision supported by the language.
System action: DCLGEN set the return code to 4 and processed the rest of the table.
User response: This is a warning. Be aware that the declaration for column 'colname' causes a compiler error. You
must edit the declaration before including it in an application program.
DSNE954I csect-name USE OF THE DCLGEN COLSUFFIX(YES) OPTION WILL RESULT IN A MIXED FIELD NAME FOR COLUMN colname. THE lang LANGUAGE DOES NOT SUPPORT MIXED FIELD NAMES.
Explanation: The COLSUFFIX(YES) option and a double-byte NAMES prefix were specified in a DCLGEN
invocation, but column colname contains single-byte characters. This combination would result in a generated field
name with a mixture of double-byte and single-byte characters, but the lang language does not support mixed field
names.
System action: DCLGEN set the return code to 4 and generated the field name as requested.
User response: This is a warning. Be aware that the declaration for column colname causes a compiler error. You
must edit the declaration before including it in an application program.
DSNE955I csect-name COLSUFFIX(YES) WAS SPECIFIED WITHOUT A NAMES PREFIX. COLUMN NAMES WILL BE USED FOR FIELD NAMES
Explanation: When COLSUFFIX(YES) is specified in a DCLGEN invocation, DCLGEN generates field names by
concatenating the NAMES prefix with the column names. However, no NAMES prefix was specified.
System action: DCLGEN set the return code to 4 and used the column names as field names.
User response: This is a warning. Specify a NAMES prefix when you specify COLSUFFIX(YES).
DSNE956A A FIELD NAME PREFIX MUST BE SPECIFIED WHEN COLUMN SUFFIX VALUE IS YES.
Explanation: When YES is specified for the COLUMN SUFFIX field on the DCLGEN panel, DCLGEN generates
field names by concatenating the value in the FIELD NAME PREFIX field with the column names. However, no
value was specified for FIELD NAME PREFIX.
System action: The DCLGEN panel generated this error message.
User response: Specify a FIELD NAME PREFIX value, or change the COLUMN SUFFIX value to NO.
DSNE957I THE LENGTH OF ONE OR MORE NAMES EXCEEDS THE STANDARD MAXIMUM ALLOWED BY THE language LANGUAGE
Explanation: DCLGEN was building a COBOL or PL/I language declaration for a table when it generated a host
variable name that is longer than the language permits.
language
The language that the declaration uses: COBOL or PL/I
The new declaration might cause a compiler error.
System action: DCLGEN issues return code to 4 and processes the rest of the table.
User response: If you want to use this declaration in an application, edit the declaration so that the length of the
host name variable is within the permitted range for the language.
DSNE958I DCLGEN DOES NOT SUPPORT THE SQL DATA TYPE data-type (SQLTYPE sql-type) FOR THE language LANGUAGE
Explanation: The specified table or view contains a column with a data type that is either not supported by or not
recognized by DCLGEN.
data-type
The data type of the column.
sql-type Numeric representation of the data type.
language
The programming language that was used for the data declaration: COBOL, PL/I, C, or C++.
System action: DCLGEN issues return code 8 and finishes processing the table. A declaration for the table or view
is created, but it is incomplete and will not compile successfully without modifications.
User response: If the reported data type is UNKNOWN, contact IBM Software Support and provide the SQLTYPE
value and programming language from the message.
For all other data types, verify that the data type that you want to use is supported by DCLGEN. If the data type
that you originally chose is not supported, you might be able to identify an alternate data type. If you want to use
the table or view declaration that DCLGEN created, update the generated declaration by either removing the column
or changing the data type.

User response: Correct the SQL statement. Determine if you skipped either this keyword or another keyword earlier
in the SQL statement. The assumed token is printed in the SYSTEM error message. This token might not be what you
intended, even though it is the only symbol allowed in the clause at this point.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNH019I W csectname OPTION: INVALID OPTION option
Explanation: The identified option was requested, but it is not a precompiler option.
System action: The option is ignored.
User response: Check the valid precompiler options to determine if your spelling is correct for this option. This
problem might cause additional errors if the APOST, APOSTSQL, COMMA, HOST, MARGINS, QUOTESQL, or
TWOPASS option is needed but not specified. The other options are either defaults or affect only the listing. Correct
the problem and run the precompile again.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNH021I W csectname OPTION: SUBOPTION NOT PERMITTED WITH OPTION option
Explanation: The identified option cannot have suboptions, but one or more were specified.

Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNH026I W csectname OPTION: INVALID MARGINS FOR HOST LANGUAGE
Explanation: The host language does not permit the specified margins.
System action: The MARGINS option is ignored.
User response: Ensure that the source statements are within the proper margins and that the margins are specified
correctly. The margins for COBOL must be 8, 72. The margins for FORTRAN must be 1, 72.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNH027I W csectname SUBOPTION suboption TOO LONG, TRUNCATED AFTER numofchar CHARS
Explanation: The version ID is greater than numofchar bytes long. The maximum length for the version ID is 64
bytes.
System action: The option is honored, but the version ID is truncated after 64 bytes.
User response: Refer to the 'options used' list in the precompiler output to see what version ID was used.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNH028I W csectname ATTACH SUBOPTION suboption NOT PERMITTED WITH HOST (FORTRAN) SPECIFIED.
Explanation: The identified suboption for precompiler option ATTACH cannot take effect when the application is a
FORTRAN application because the interface code for FORTRAN is always DSNHFT.

User response: None is required. However, you can either code ATTACH(TSO) or specify no ATTACH precompiler
option
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNH029I E csectname LINE nnnn COL cc INTO CLAUSE REQUIRED
Explanation: SELECT statements embedded in an application program must have an INTO clause to denote where
the results of the SELECT are to be placed. Dynamic SELECT statements do not permit the INTO clause.
System action: The statement is replaced by host language statements that, if executed, set an error code in the
SQLCA.
User response: Add the INTO clause to the SELECT statement, and precompile the application program again.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNH030I W csectname LINE nnnn COL cc STATEMENT CONTAINS WRONG NUMBER OF 'INTO' VARIABLES
Explanation: The number of variables specified in an INTO clause is not the same as the number of select-list
elements (taking into account expansion of host structures and '*' or 'table.*' select entries according to the
declarations supplied).
System action: Processing continues.
User response: Ensure the included table declarations are correct. If the declarations are correct, this statement
causes an error when the application program is bound. If the declarations are incorrect, you can proceed, but the
declarations should be corrected. Otherwise, you need to correct the SQL statement and precompile again.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNH031I W csectname LINE nnnn COL cc STATEMENT CREATES A COLUMN WITH NAME name1 WHICH DOES NOT MATCH DECLARED NAME name2
Explanation: The column name specified in a CREATE statement (name1) is not the same as the name of the
corresponding column in the DECLARE TABLE statement (name2).
System action: Processing continues.
User response: Ensure that the DECLARE TABLE matches the CREATE TABLE. You can use the cross-reference and
source listings to help find the two statements.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNH032I W csectname LINE nnnn COL cc STATEMENT CREATES A COLUMN name WHOSE ATTRIBUTES DO NOT MATCH THE DECLARATION
Explanation: The column name is specified in a CREATE statement with a different data type or length than was
specified for the corresponding column in the DECLARE TABLE statement.
System action: Processing continues.
User response: Correct the DECLARE TABLE or CREATE TABLE statement. If the DECLARE TABLE statement is
incorrect, some warnings might also be incorrect or might not be generated when needed. If the CREATE TABLE
statement is incorrect, you must correct it.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNH033I W csectname LINE nnnn COL cc STATEMENT CREATES MORE OR LESS COLUMNS THAN WERE DECLARED
Explanation: The number of columns specified in a CREATE statement is different from the number of columns
specified in the DECLARE TABLE statement.
System action: Processing continues.
User response: Ensure that the DECLARE TABLE matches the CREATE TABLE. If the DECLARE TABLE statement
is incorrect, some warnings might also be incorrect or might not be generated when needed. If the CREATE TABLE
statement is incorrect, you must correct it.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNH034I W csectname LINE nnnn COL cc STATEMENT INSERTS MORE OR LESS VALUES THAN THE NUMBER OF COLUMNS DECLARED
Explanation: The number of values specified in an INSERT operation is different from the number of columns
specified in the DECLARE TABLE statement for the receiving table.
System action: Processing continues.
User response: Insert the correct number of values. If the DECLARE TABLE statement is incorrect, this warning
might also be incorrect. If the INSERT operation is incorrect, you must correct it.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNH038I S csectname LINE nnnn COL cc PROGRAM OR SUBPROGRAM CONTAINS MORE THAN 32767 SQL STATEMENTS
Explanation: The number of SQL statements in an application program or a FORTRAN subprogram is greater than
32767.
System action: The precompiler terminates.
User response: Divide the application program or subprogram into smaller programs or reduce the SQL statements
in each program unit so that the maximum number of SQL statements is not exceeded.
Severity: 12 (severe error)
DSNH041I W csectname OPTION: MISSING HOST OPTION
Explanation: The host language was not specified in the OPTION field.
System action: HOST(COBOL) is assumed.
User response: Specify the host language if it is not COBOL. It is probably best to specify the host language and
remove all warnings.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNH042I W csectname OPTION: option OPTION INVALID FOR HOST LANGUAGE
Explanation: The option identified in the message is not valid. The QUOTE and COMMA options are not permitted
with HOST(ASM), HOST(PLI), or HOST(C). The TWOPASS option is not permitted with HOST(COBOL).
System action: The specified option is ignored.
User response: Remove the invalid option, or correct the host specification.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNH049I W csectname RETURN CODE IS FORCED TO 4 BECAUSE OPTION SQL(ALL) IS IN EFFECT, ORIGINAL RETURN CODE WAS nnn
Explanation: One or more SQL-related error messages were detected by the precompiler, but because of option
SQL(ALL), the return code is forced to 4 in order to let the application proceed with compilation.
The SQL syntax checking is deferred until bind time because the source might contain non-DB2 SQL syntax that the
DB2 precompiler does not recognize and flags as an error. The DBRM produced by this precompilation cannot be
bound successfully by DB2 if there are SQL syntax errors or non-DB2 SQL syntax.
The return code remains untouched if there are host-related syntax or semantic errors in the source.
System action: Processing continues.
User response: Ensure that the intention of this precompilation is for executing it in a non-DB2 system.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNH050I I csectname WARNINGS HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED DUE TO LACK OF TABLE DECLARATIONS
Explanation: One or more warning messages were suppressed because no table declarations were found before the
first SQL statement that referenced a table or column.
System action: Processing continues. Suppression is discontinued if a table declaration is found.
User response: Insert (or INCLUDE) table declarations before they are referenced in order to permit table and
column checking.
Severity: 0
DSNH051I E csectname LINE nnnn COL cc sqltype name PREVIOUSLY DECLARED OR REFERENCED
Explanation: The variable sqltype is TABLE, CURSOR, or STATEMENT. The identifier name was already defined
with the given sqltype. The definition might have occurred implicitly. For example, name might have been found in
the FROM clause of a SELECT, causing it to be defined as a table.
System action: The name is installed in the symbol table as a duplicate.
User response: Remove duplicate definitions, or correct the references. Avoid implicit definitions by inserting (or
including) table declarations before they are referenced. Check the number of passes used. Use the cross-reference
and source listings to help resolve this type of error.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNH052I E csectname LINE nnnn COL cc COLUMN name IS ALREADY DEFINED IN TABLE table-name
Explanation: The identified name is already defined as a column in the table named table-name. The definition might
have occurred implicitly. For example, table-name might have been found in a select-list, causing name to be defined
as a column within table-name if table-name was not declared as a host variable.
System action: The name is installed in the symbol table as a duplicate.
User response: Remove duplicate definitions, or correct the references. Avoid implicit definitions by inserting (or
including) table declarations before they are referenced.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNH053I W csectname NO SQL STATEMENTS WERE FOUND
Explanation: No SQL statements were found in the precompiler input file. An empty DBRM member was written.
System action: Processing continues.
User response: If you embedded SQL statements in your application program and none were found, make sure
your column margins are properly defined for your application program.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNH057I E csect-name LINE line-number COL column number RETURN STATEMENT IN AN SQL FUNCTION MUST RETURN A VALUE

The location of the error in the source program.
System action: The statement can not be processed.
User response: Add a return value to the statement, and try the request again.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNH060I E csectname LINE nnnn COL cc INVALID type SPECIFICATION: spec
Explanation: The type is either SCALE or LENGTH. The spec is the given SCALE or LENGTH specification in an
SQL declaration. Length and scale specifications must be unsigned integers. The scale specification, where permitted,
cannot exceed the length. The length specification cannot be 0.
System action: Processing continues.
User response: Correct the length or scaling.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNH078I E csect-name LINE line-number COL column number PARAMETER NAMES MUST BE SPECIFIED FOR ROUTINE routine-name
Explanation: The routine does not have parameter names specified for all parameters.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
line-number and column number
The location of the error in the source program.
routine-name
The name of the routine.
When the SQL routine is defined with LANGUAGE SQL, a parameter name is required for each parameter that is
defined. For native SQL procedures, LANGUAGE SQL is optional, but for external SQL procedures, LANGUAGE
SQL is required.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Ensure that each defined parameter includes a parameter name.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNH080I E csectname LINE nnnn COL cc usage VARIABLE name IS NOT type TYPE
Explanation: The usage is INDICATOR or STRING. The type is SMALLINT, VARCHAR, or CHARACTER. The data
type of the variable name is not acceptable. All indicator variables must be small integers. PREPARE and EXECUTE
strings must be variable character strings, except for FORTRAN, which requires character type.
System action: If the containing SQL statement is a declaration, it is discarded. If the containing SQL statement is
executable, it is replaced by host language statements that will, if executed, set an error code in the SQLCA.
User response: Specify a host variable of the proper type.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNH081I W csectname LINE nnnn COL cc STATEMENT DOES NOT CONFORM TO ANS SYNTAX STANDARD - REASON CODE ccc
Explanation: When the precompiler option STDSQL(YES) is in effect, the SQL syntax is checked to see if it conforms
to the ANSI/ISO SQL standard of 1992. Reason codes are:
000 Aggregate function with DISTINCT as an arithmetic-operation operand does not conform to the ANSI/ISO
SQL standard of 1992.
001 FOR UPDATE OF as part of a DECLARE CURSOR statement does not conform to the ANSI/ISO SQL
standard of 1992.
System action: Processing continues.
System programmer response: Check the SQL statement.
User response: You have the option of changing or not changing the syntax to conform to the ANS syntax standard.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNH083I I csectname LINE nnnn COL cc IBM SQL RESERVED WORD ibmkeywd SPECIFIED AS AN IDENTIFIER NAME
Explanation: When the precompiler option SQL(ALL) is in effect, IBM SQL reserved words should not be used as
identifier names. Using IBM SQL reserved words limits the portability of the statement.
System action: Processing continues.
User response: If possible, change the identifier name to a non-IBM SQL reserved word so that the statement
conforms to the IBM SQL standard. Not changing the identifier name means that the program is less portable within
the IBM SQL environment.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNH084I W csectname LINE nnnn COL cc UNACCEPTABLE SQL STATEMENT
Explanation: The referenced SQL statement is not allowed in this situation, but it will not cause an error. Depending
on the option specified at precompile time, one of the following occurred.
v The BEGIN DECLARE SECTION(*), END DECLARE SECTION(*), and UPDATE STATISTICS statements are
flagged as not compatible.
* For C applications, BEGIN and END DECLARE SECTION are not flagged.
* For other languages, the statement is only allowed with precompiler option STDSQL(YES).
v Using the STDSQL(YES) precompiler option, the INCLUDE SQLCA statement is flagged as a warning.
System action: The BEGIN DECLARE SECTION, END DECLARE SECTION, and INCLUDE SQLCA statements are
ignored. The other statements are replaced by host language statements that will, if executed, set a warning code or
SQLCODE -84 in the SQLCA.
User response: Unless this application program is used in a portable manner, remove the statement.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNH088I W csectname LINE nnnn COL cc THIS STATEMENT WILL action AN ENTIRE TABLE
Explanation: The action is either DELETE or UPDATE. The referenced SQL statement has no WHERE clause and
will delete or update all rows of the specified table. This message is printed as a warning to the programmer.
System action: Processing continues.
User response: Be sure that you intend to delete or update all rows, or add a suitable WHERE clause.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNH090I S csectname LINE nnnn COL cc HOST VARIABLE NOT PERMITTED HERE: name
Explanation: Host variable references are not permitted in this type of SQL statement. The name is invalid.
System action: The statement is replaced by host language statements that will, if executed, set an error code in the
SQLCA.
User response: Specify a literal or a column name rather than a host variable. The colon (:) indicates that the name
that follows is a host variable. Remove it to specify a column name.
Severity: 12 (severe error)
DSNH091I I csectname LINE nnnn COL cc EBCDIC CCSID used for string-expression.
Explanation: In a PL/1 application program, a string-expression was specified for a PREPARE or EXECUTE
IMMEDIATE statement, and the precompiler-generated structures for this string-expression specify an EBCDIC
CCSID.
System action: Processing continues.
User response: If you intended that the string-expression should be treated as a string expression, then no action is
required.
If the string-expression consists of just one host variable, and you intended that the string-expression should be
treated as a host variable, then the host variable must be preceded by a colon, and at least one DECLARE VARIABLE
statement must be contained in your program source.
If you add a DECLARE VARIABLE for any host variable in your program source, and re-precompile your
application, the variable previously treated as a string-expression by the precompiler will be treated as a host variable
and this message will not be issued.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNH097I E csectname LINE nnnn COL cc. THE USE OF LONG VARCHAR OR LONG VARGRAPHIC IS NOT ALLOWED IN THIS CONTEXT.
Explanation: The statement attempted to use the LONG VARCHAR or LONG VARGRAPHIC syntax. This syntax
cannot be used for the following statements:

DSNH101I S csectname THE STATEMENT IS TOO LONG OR TOO COMPLEX.
Explanation: The statement cannot be executed because it exceeds the system limits for either length or complexity.
System action: The statement cannot be executed.
User response: Break the statement into shorter or less complex SQL statements.
Severity: 16
DSNH102I E csectname STRING CONSTANT IS TOO LONG. STRING BEGINS string
Explanation: The string constant beginning with string has a length greater than the maximum allowed length. Most
strings have these limits:
v For a hexadecimal constant (X, GX, or UX), the number of hexadecimal digits must not exceed 32704.
v Any other character string constant must be short enough so that its UTF-8 representation requires no more than
32704 bytes.
v Any other graphic string constant must be short enough so that its UTF-8 representation requires no more than
32704 bytes.
v The sum of the lengths of the UTF-8 representations of the constant values in an ENDING AT clause must not
exceed 765 bytes. This clause applies to CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, CREATE INDEX, or ALTER INDEX.
In some contexts, however, the limit is smaller.
For special registers, the allowable length depends on the particular special register. A string that exceeds the limit
can be specified only through assignment from a host variable. If this release of DB2 increases the maximum allowed
length of a string constant, then an attempt to exploit the new length before using the New Function Mode produces
this SQL return code.
Two consecutive string delimiters are used to represent one string delimiter within the character string, but these
count as 2 bytes when calculating the lengths of character string constants.
System action: If the SQL statement containing the string is a declaration, it is discarded. If the SQL statement
containing the string is executable, it is replaced by host language statements that, if executed, set an error code in
the SQLCA.
User response: Correct the string. If a shorter string is acceptable, reduce the length of the string constant. If a long
string is required, a host variable is required.

DSNH103I E csectname constant IS AN INVALID NUMERIC CONSTANT
Explanation: The token was found. It begins with a digit, but it is not a valid integer, decimal, or float literal.
Identifiers cannot begin with a digit except for the WHENEVER statement with HOST(FORTRAN), and the
identifiers in COBOL.
System action: If the containing SQL statement is a declaration, it is discarded. If the containing SQL statement is
executable, it is replaced by host language statements that will, if executed, set an error code in the SQLCA.

DSNH104I E csectname LINE nnnn COL cc ILLEGAL SYMBOL "token". SOME SYMBOLS THAT MIGHT BE LEGAL ARE: token-list
Explanation: A syntax error was detected where the symbol "token" occurs in the SQL statement. The list of symbols
that might be legal shows some alternate symbols that could possibly be correct at that point, if the preceding part of
the statement is entirely correct.
However, the preceding part of the statement might be incorrect. For example, if an important keyword is omitted,
DB2 detects the error later, and not always immediately after the point where the keyword should appear. The list of
alternate symbols are only suggestions.
System action: If the containing SQL statement is a declaration, it is discarded. If the containing SQL statement is

v The UNION operator is not allowed in an embedded SELECT clause.
v A CREATE TABLESPACE statement cannot specify LOCKPART without the NUMPARTS option.
v An ALTER TABLESPACE statement cannot specify LOCKPART for a non-partitioned table space.
v A table space with LOCKPART YES cannot be altered to LOCKSIZE TABLESPACE.
v A table space with LOCKSIZE TABLESPACE cannot be altered to LOCKPART YES.
v The LARGE clause without the NUMPARTS option is not allowed in a CREATE TABLESPACE statement.
v DESCRIBE INPUT statement can not have USING clause.
v The table being updated in a POSITIONED UPDATE statement can not be assigned a correlation name.
v On a CREATE INDEX statement, the INCLUDE clause is not allowed for any of the following indexes:
C A non-unique index
C A partitioning index, when index-controlled partitioning is being used
C An XML index
C An extended index
System action: If the containing SQL statement is a declaration, it is discarded. If the containing SQL statement is
executable, it is replaced by host language statements that will, if executed, set an error code in the SQLCA.
User response: Remove the clause. You might need to use a cursor to perform the processing. The ORDER and FOR

DSNH113I E csectname LINE nnnn COL cc INVALID CHARACTER FOUND IN string, REASON CODE - nnn
Explanation: The string contains an invalid character. It can be an SQL ordinary identifier name, a host variable
name, or a DBCS comment.
Certain SQL identifiers (for example names of buffer pools, databases, and plans) must contain only uppercase
alphabetic or national characters and numerics; the first character must be alphabetic or national.
The following reason codes apply to SBCS identifiers:
000 An invalid character was found in the SBCS identifier (including the case in which a DBCS identifier was
used where only an SBCS identifier is allowed).
The following reason codes apply to DBCS identifiers or comments:
101 An odd number of bytes exists between the shift-out and the shift-in character.
102 Either a shift-in or shift-out character is missing.
103 DBCS blanks X'4040' are not allowed.
104 There are no characters between the shift-out and the shift-in characters.

csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.

The numeric representation of the column. The first column is identified as column 1, the second as column
2, and so on.
variable-name
The name of the variable that caused the error.
This message is issued only at reference time.
System action: If the SQL statement that contains the variable is a declaration, it is discarded.
If the SQL statement that contains the variable is executable, it is replaced by host language statements that, if
executed, set an error code in the SQLCA.
User response: Check the declaration and the attributes of the named host variable. If you intended the name to
refer to a column, the colon (:) must not be present. If you intended a literal, enclose the value in string delimiters
(apostrophes or quotation marks).
If you intended to use a host variable, only a subset of the possible variable declarations are valid for use as a DB2
host variable. See the information about rules for host variables in an SQL statement.
To determine the source of the problem, use the cross-reference listing and the source listing to determine whether
any of the following situations apply:
v If you use the STDSQL(YES) SQL processing option, make sure that all of the host variable declarations are
declared within the BEGIN DECLARE SECTION and the END DECLARE SECTION.
v If the cross-reference listing does not contain the host variable name, the declaration is missing. If the source for a
declaration is present, a missing terminator from a comment or from a string might cause this type of error. The
margin settings might also cause this type of error.
v If the name is present, but the data type is not listed, the host variable is not usable; it does not follow the rules for
valid host variable definitions.
v If several definitions exist for the name, the first reference might occur before the definition. In this situation, the
TWOPASS SQL processing option helps by processing DECLARE statements before the other types of statements.
However, host variable declarations and cursor declarations are processed in the same pass. The host variables that
are referenced in cursor declarations must be defined before the cursor is defined in the application program. This
rule applies regardless of whether the ONEPASS or TWOPASS SQL processing option is used.
v A parameter marker is expected rather than a host variable in an EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement.
v The data type of a host variable that is passed in a CALL statement is not CHAR or VARCHAR.
v The length attribute of a CHAR or VARCHAR host variable that is passed in a CALL statement exceeds 255
characters.
v If you are using the precompiler for COBOL, check whether the named host variable is declared in a structure that
contains FILLER elements. The FILLER elements might invalidate the variables in the structure.

Explanation: DB2 parses SQL statements in Unicode UTF-8 (CCSID 1208). The DB2 precompiler or coprocessor will
convert the application program internally (not externally) from the application source EBCDIC CCSID to UTF-8 for
processing. In some cases, DB2 also converts portions from UTF-8 back to the source EBCDIC CCSID. This message
indicates that the conversion could not take place.

error:
000 An invalid ccsid was specified on the CCSID option.
001 No conversion is defined from the original CCSID to the target CCSID
System action: The precompiler or coprocessor is terminated.
System programmer response: Make sure that the Unicode System Services conversion image includes the required
conversions.
User response: Check that the value of the CCSID option is valid. Run the precompilation again with a valid CCSID
if you do not want to use the EBCDIC system CCSID.

DSNH350I E csect-name column-name WAS IMPLICITLY OR EXPLICITLY REFERENCED IN A CONTEXT IN WHICH IT CANNOT BE USED
Explanation: The ALTER, CREATE, or DECLARE TEMPORARY TABLE statement is invalid for one of the following
reasons:
v A LOB, DECFLOAT, or XML column cannot be specified as a column of the primary key in a PRIMARY KEY
clause.
v A LOB, DECFLOAT, or XML column cannot be specified as a column of a UNIQUE KEY.
v A LOB, DECFLOAT, XML, or security label column cannot be specified as a column of a foreign key in a
referential-constraint clause.
v A LOB, DECFLOAT, XML, or security label column cannot be specified as a column of a parent key in a
REFERENCES clause.
v A LOB, DECFLOAT, or XML column cannot be specified as a column of a partitioning key for range partitioning.
v A LOB or XML column cannot be defined in a temporary table (created global temporary table or declared global
temporary table).
v A LOB, DECFLOAT, or XML column cannot be defined in a table that has an EDITPROC.
v A LOB, DECFLOAT, or XML column cannot be specified as a column of an index key, and the result data type,
including the intermediate result, of a key expression for an index cannot be a LOB, DECFLOAT, XML, or a
distinct type based on a LOB or DECFLOAT data type. Exception: For an XML index, only XML columns can be
specified, and the result type of the index key can be DECFLOAT.
v A hidden column or security label column cannot be specified in a key expression for an index.
v A ROWID, LOB, or XML data type cannot be the data type of a column in the result table of an as-result-table
clause of a CREATE TABLE or DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE statement.
v A security label column column-name exists in the result table of the as-result-table clause; however, it is not the only
security label column in that result table. A table can be defined only with a single security label column.
v A LOB or XML column cannot be defined in a table that has an edit procedure that is defined with row attribute
sensitivity.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Correct the syntax, and reissue the statement.

DSNH372I E csectname ONLY ONE ROWID, ROW CHANGE TIMESTAMP, SECURITY LABEL OR IDENTITY COLUMN IS ALLOWED IN A TABLE
Explanation: An attempt was made to do one of the following actions:
v Create a table with more than one ROWID column.
v Add a ROWID column to a table that already has one.
v Create a table with more than one identity column.
v Add an identity column to a table that already has one.
v Add a security label column to a table that already has one.
v Create a table with more than one security label column.
v Create a table with more than one row change timestamp column.
v Add a row change timestamp column to a table that already has one.
v Create a table without a security label in the Common Criteria environment which requires a security label column
on every table created.
System action: The statement cannot be executed.
User response: For a CREATE TABLE statement, select only one column to have the row ID data type, the
IDENTITY attribute, the SECURITY LABEL attribute, or the row change timestamp attribute. For an ALTER TABLE
statement, a ROWID column, identity column, or security label column already exists for the table. Do not attempt to
add another column with the data type row ID, with the AS IDENTITY attribute or the AS SECURITY LABEL to the
table. If the Common Criteria environment is set (DSN6SPRM COMCRIT= YES), then every table created must have
a security label. Designate a column AS SECURITY LABEL or change the subsystem parameter.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNH385I ASSIGNMENT TO AN SQLSTATE OR SQLCODE VARIABLE IN AN SQL PROCEDURE routine-name MAY BE OVER-WRITTEN AND DOES NOT ACTIVATE ANY HANDLER
Explanation: SQL routine routine-name was created, but it contains an assignment statement that specifies the
SQLCODE or SQLSTATE variable as the target. Assignment to an SQLSTATE or SQLCODE variable in an SQL
routine only changes the value in the variable, and does not activate any handler. The SQLSTATE and SQLCODE
variables are assigned values by processing of SQL statements in the SQL routine. Therefore, any value assigned
might be over-written as a result of SQL statement processing.
System action: The routine definition is processed successfully.
Programmer response: No recovery is necessary. If the intent was to signal an error or warning, specify the SIGNAL
or RESIGNAL statement instead of the assignment. To prevent this warning, remove any assignments to the
SQLSTATE or SQLCODE special variables.

Explanation: The SQLSTATE specified in the RAISE_ERROR function, RESIGNAL statement, or SIGNAL statement
of a trigger or a routine does not conform to the rules for a valid SQLSTATE.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Correct the SQLSTATE specified in the RAISE_ERROR function or SIGNAL or RESIGNAL statement.
The SQLSTATE must be a character string containing exactly 5 characters. It must be of type CHAR defined with a
length of 5, or a type VARCHAR defined with a length of 5 or greater. The SQLSTATE value must follow the rules
for application-defined SQLSTATEs as follows:
v Each character must be from the set of digits ('0' through '9') or non-accented upper case letters ('A' through 'Z').
v The SQLSTATE class (first two characters) cannot be '00' since this represents successful completion.

because of errors.
System action: If the containing SQL statement is a declaration, it is discarded. If the containing SQL statement is
executable, it is replaced by host language statements that will, if executed, set an error code in the SQLCA.
User response: Correct or add the required cursor declaration.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNH506I E csectname LINE nnnn COL cc DECLARE CURSOR FOR STATEMENT NAME MUST PRECEDE THE PREPARE STATEMENT FOR THAT STATEMENT NAME
Explanation: This DECLARE name CURSOR statement is preceded by a PREPARE name statement. In DB2,
declarations must precede action statements. This is not the same as in SQL/DS.
System action: The declaration is noted as being in error and discarded.
User response: Move the DECLARE or PREPARE statement so that they are in the proper order, or specify the
TWOPASS option if the host language is PLI, ASM, or C. The TWOPASS option has the precompiler check for
declarations on the first pass and avoids this problem.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNH520I E csectname THE OPEN STATEMENT FOR CURSOR cursor-name IS INVALID BECAUSE THE CURSOR WAS DEFINED BY AN ALLOCATE CURSOR STATEMENT
Explanation: The cursor was not successfully declared, so it was assumed to be defined by an ALLOCATE CURSOR
statement. A cursor defined by an ALLOCATE CURSOR statement is open after successful completion of the
statement. Attempting to OPEN an allocated cursor is an error.
System action: The statement cannot be executed.
User response: Add or fix the declaration of the cursor. If the cursor is supposed to be defined by an ALLOCATE
CURSOR statement then remove the OPEN statement.
Severity: 8 (error)

DSNH527I WARNING: THE PRECOMPILER OR DB2 COPROCESSOR ATTEMPTED TO USE THE DB2-SUPPLIED DSNHDECP MODULE.
Explanation: The DSNHDECP module that is supplied by DB2 is being used to run the DB2 precompiler or
coprocessor. The precompiler or coprocessor requires site-dependent settings that are specified in the DSNHDECP
module that was created when DB2 was installed. The installation-generated DSNHDECP module typically resides in
the SDSNEXIT library.
System action: Processing halts.
System programmer response: The following actions are required to enable the DSNH CLIST to load your
user-supplied DSNHDECP module rather than the DB2 DSNHDECP module that was supplied by DB2:
1. The JOBLIB or STEPLIB concatenation of any job or TSO userid that calls DSNH needs to allocate the library
where the user-supplied DSNHDECP module resides (usually prefix.SDSNEXIT) ahead of the library where the
DB2-supplied DSNHDECP module resides (prefix.SDSNLOAD).
2. The DSNH call should include the PCLOAD parameter, and it should be coded as shown here:
PCLOAD('*(DSNHPC)').
User response: Check the STEPLIB, JOBLIB, or system link list concatenation used in the DB2 address spaces. To
ensure that the proper DSNHDECP module is used, verify that the library that contains the DSNHDECP module that
is generated during installation precedes the SDSNLOAD library that contains the DSNHDECP module that was
supplied by DB2.

Explanation: The CURRENT PATH special register is defined as a VARCHAR(254). The content of the string
includes each schema name delimited with double quotes and separated from the next schema name by a comma.
The total length of the string of all schema names in the CURRENT PATH cannot exceed 254 characters. A SET
CURRENT PATH statement causing this message would exceed this limit.
System action: The statement cannot be executed.
User response: Remove schema names to reduce the total length to fit the 254 character maximum length. If all the
schema names are required, it may be necessary to consolidate some user-defined functions so that fewer schema
names are required for the CURRENT PATH.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNH587I A list of item-references are not in the same family.
Explanation: Each item-reference in the SET assignment statement is either a host-variable or a transition-variable.
The list of item-references must be of the same family, meaning if one of the item-references is a transition-variable,
then all of the item-references in the list must be a transition-variable. If the statement is used in the triggered action
of a CREATE TRIGGER statement, each item-reference must identify a transition variable. If the statement is used in
any other context, each item-reference must identify a host variable.
System action: The corresponding SQL statement is replaced by host language statements that will, if executed, set
an error code in the SQLCA.
User response: Correct the syntax of the SQL statement and precompile the program again. Refer to the DB2 SQL

Explanation: The CREATE INDEX, CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW or ALTER TABLE statement specifies the same
'column-name' for two (or more) columns of the index, table, view, or the UPDATE OF clause of a trigger definition
specifies the same column name more than once. Column names must be unique within an index, a table, a view, or
in the UPDATE OF clause of a trigger definition. A column cannot be specified in more than one ALTER TABLE
clause except if it is specified in an ALTER COLUMN clause and ADD CHECK CONSTRAINT clause.
System action: The statement cannot be executed.
User response: Correct the CREATE statement to specify unique names for each of the columns of the index, table,
view, or the columns in the UPDATE OF clause of a trigger definition. Correct the ALTER statement to specify
unique names for each of the ALTER COLUMN clauses.
This error can also occur on CREATE TABLE when a column list of a PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, or UNIQUE

DSNH683I E csectname LINE nnnn COL cc. THE SPECIFICATION FOR COLUMN, DISTINCT TYPE, FUNCTION, OR PROCEDURE data-item CONTAINS INCOMPATIBLE CLAUSES
Explanation: There is an error in the data item specification in a statement. Incompatible specifications are present
such as "INTEGER and FOR BIT DATA", or "INTEGER AS LOCATOR". The location of the error is given by data-item
as follows:
v For a CREATE or ALTER TABLE statement, data-item gives the name of the column containing the error. The error
could be an invalid specification of FOR BIT DATA, FOR SBCS DATA, FOR MIXED DATA, or FIELDPROC for
column data-item.
v For a CREATE FUNCTION or CREATE PROCEDURE statement, data-item is a token that identifies the area of the
problem in the statement. For example, "PARAMETER 3", "RETURNS", or "CAST FROM".
v For a CREATE DISTINCT TYPE statement, data-item gives the name of the type being defined
v Otherwise, data-item is a token that identifies the area of the problem in a parameter list for a function. For
example, "PARAMETER 5".

DSNH741I process1(NO) IMPLIES THAT process2 CANNOT BE RUN
Explanation: An inconsistent processing set was specified. An earlier phase and a later phase were requested, but
not the intermediate step needed to process data between them. For example, requesting the precompile and the link
edit without the compiler produces this error. Values for process1 are PRECOMP, CICSXLAT, COMPILE, LINK, or
BIND. Values for process2 are COMPILE, LINK, or RUN.
This message is issued by the following CLIST: DSNH
System action: process2 is not performed, but other processing is done.
User response: Specify a consistent combination of processing. Application program preparation needs to run all the
steps to provide a correct application program. The process does allow beginning or ending steps to be run at a
different time. See message DSNH740I for the required step order.

DSNH752I INPUT DATA SET NAME IS MISSING OR NONE
Explanation: The DSNH CLIST requires a value for the input data set name (INPUT). You cannot use an input data
set name of NONE.
This message is issued by the following CLIST: DSNH
System action: The CLIST prompts for a name, if prompting is allowed. If prompting is not allowed, for example in
batch or when PROFILE NOPROMPT was entered, the CLIST terminates.
User response: Specify an INPUT name. See message DSNH753I.
Severity: 0 (successful)
DSNH753I ENTER INPUT DATA SET NAME
Explanation: The CLIST is requesting the name of the input data set.
This message is issued by the following CLIST: DSNH
System action: The system waits for user to enter data set name or for the CLIST to be terminated.
User response: Enter the name of the data set. Do not specify the parameter or command, but just enter the name of
the data set. The standard TSO prefixing will be done if the data set name is not entered within apostrophes.
Severity: 0 (successful)
DSNH754I clist OUTNAME PARAMETER name MUST NOT CONTAIN SPECIAL CHARACTERS
Explanation: The DSNH and DSNHC CLISTs, clist, use the OUTNAME parameter to build names for a number of
data sets that are passed from phase to phase. These names are prefixed by an authorization ID or TSO prefix value
and have a number of suffixes. For this reason, OUTNAME parameter name must not contain special characters. It
can contain a period or national characters. It cannot have apostrophes to specify a single data set name.
System action: The CLIST is terminated.
User response: Correct the input request. The default for this parameter is TEMP, which should be adequate for
most usage.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNH755I OUTNAME PARAMETER name MUST NOT BEGIN THE SAME AS INPUT input
Explanation: The DSNH CLIST uses the OUTNAME parameter name to build a number of data sets that are passed
from phase to phase. These data sets could conflict with the INPUT data set (input) if the names are the same,
causing the INPUT data set to be overwritten. To avoid this problem, the names are not allowed to have the same
initial characters.
This message is issued by the following CLIST: DSNH
System action: The CLIST is terminated.
User response: Correct the input request. Specify a different OUTNAME. The default for OUTNAME is TEMP.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNH756I clist PRINT PARAMETER name MUST NOT CONTAIN SPECIAL CHARACTERS
Explanation: The DSNH and DSNHC CLISTs (clist) use the PRINT parameter to build names for data sets used for
the print listings from various phases. These names are prefixed by an authorization ID or a TSO prefix value and
have a number of suffixes. The PRINT parameter name can contain a period or national characters, but it cannot
contain special characters. It cannot have apostrophes to specify a single data set name.
The data set names built using the PRINT(print) qualifier are the following:
print.CXLIST
CICS Command Translator
print.LINKLIST
Linkage Editor
print.LIST
Compiler or Assembler
print.PCLIST
DB2 Precompiler
print.SYSCPRT.LIST

System action: The CLIST terminates.
User response: Use the specified language in the TSO or batch environment.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNH759I clist TERMINATING, phase RC = retcode
Explanation: The DSNH or DSNHC clist terminated at phase because the return code retcode was greater than or
equal to the RCTERM parameter value.
System action: The CLIST terminates.
User response: Determine the cause for the high return code. If the parameters include TERM(NONE) and direct
the PRINT to a data set, you might need to search the print data sets for the listing of the error. Refer to message DSNH756I for an explanation of the print data set names assigned during processing.
Problem determination: The location of the messages describing the prior errors depends upon the values of the
TERM and PRINT parameters. The messages can be directed to the terminal, to preallocated data sets, or to data sets
dynamically allocated during CLIST processing.
If TERM(NONE) PRINT(NONE) was specified, the messages are not available. Execute the CLIST again and specify a
location for the error messages.
To find the documentation, note the immediately preceding DSNH740I message for the location of the listings. If the
'LISTING IN data-set' portion of the message is missing, specify a PRINT data set, SOURCE(YES) and XREF(YES),
and execute the CLIST again. Use TERM(TERM) to direct error messages to your terminal. These listings and
execution of the DSNH CLIST are required for problem diagnosis.
If the error is in the CLIST or the error location is CLIST CHECKING, use CONTROL(SYMLIST) to produce a
detailed trace of the CLIST execution and provide the trace listing.
Check for DSNH751I messages that describe the error.

Explanation: An internal compiler consistency check failed. The following list contains the possible reason codes:
000 The message formatter was called with an unlisted internal message number.
001 The parser received a token code of 0 from the lexical scan. Lexical scan refers to a scan of words rather
than syntax.
002 Error in storage suballocation control blocks.
v The error might have occurred because a DB2 SQL statement limitation was exceeded. The SQL statement
might be referencing, creating, or declaring more columns than the DB2 defined maximum number
allowed for an SQL statement. Another possibility is that too many host variables are being referenced in
the SQL statement.
003 Error in a storage suballocation request.
v This error might have occurred because of storage constraints when building the DBRM entry for the SQL
statement or because the SQL statement exceeds the DB2 maximum statement length.
004 Error in pointer structures.
005 On BIND or REBIND, a host variable was not found.
006 Unexpected value for parser option.
007 The size of a DBRM entry exceeds the maximum size.
008 Internal conversion error.
v An error occurred when converting a timestamp version-id.
System action: The precompiler or coprocessor is terminated immediately.

DSNH902I U csect-name SEVERE INTERNAL PRECOMPILER OR DB2 COPROCESSOR ERROR IN CONVERSION FROM CCSID ccsid-1 TO CCSID ccsid-2, REASON reason-code
Explanation: DB2 parses SQL statements in Unicode UTF-8 (CCSID 1208). The DB2 precompiler or coprocessor will
convert the application program internally (not externally) from the application source EBCDIC CCSID to UTF-8 for
processing. In some cases, DB2 also converts portions from UTF-8 back to the source EBCDIC CCSID. This message
indicates that a severe error has occurred in the internal conversion.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
ccsid-1 The original CCSID.
ccsid-2 The converted CCSID.
reason-code
A numeric value that indicates the reason for the failure. A numeric value that indicates the context of this
error:
001 The internal buffer is too small for the conversion.
002 An invalid code point was found during conversion.
003 The string being converted does not conform to the rules for valid data.
004 A miscellaneous error occurred on conversion.
System action: The precompiler or coprocessor is terminated immediately.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.

The name of the control section that issued the message.
line-number and column-number
The location of the error in the source program.
When NEWFUN(NO) is specified, you cannot use syntax for functions that are introduced by the current version of
DB2. When NEWFUN(V9) is specified, you cannot use syntax for any functions that were introduced after Version 9.
When the value of NEWFUN(V8) is specified, you cannot use syntax for any functions that were introduced after
Version 8.
System action: If the containing SQL statement is a declaration, it is discarded. If the containing SQL statement is
executable, it is replaced by host language statements that will, if executed, set an error code in the SQLCA.
Programmer response: Check the value of the SQL processing option setting for NEWFUN. If the NEWFUN option
is not specified, then the installation default value is used.
Do one of these things:
v Restrict your program to functions that earlier releases of DB2 introduced. These functions are allowed regardless
of the value of NEWFUN.
v Process your program with a value of YES for the NEWFUN option. However, you cannot BIND the DBRM until

DSNH5033I DECLARE VARIABLE NOT VALID FOR variable
Explanation: Host variable variable specified in a DECLARE VARIABLE statement is not valid. The DECLARE
VARIABLE statement occurs after any SQL statement (in a COBOL or FORTRAN application program) or after a
DECLARE CURSOR statement (in an application program in any other host language), where the SQL statement and
the DECLARE VARIABLE refer to the same variable.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Ensure that the DECLARE VARIABLE occurs before the use of the host variable in an SQL statement
in the application.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNH5034I DECLARE VARIABLE NOT VALID FOR variable
Explanation: Host variable variable specified in a DECLARE VARIABLE statement is not valid for one of the
following reasons:
v A reference is made to a variable that does not exist.
v A reference is made to a variable that is a structure.
v A reference is made to a variable that is a component of two more structures.
v The host variable is not defined as character, varying-length character, graphic, varying-length graphic, CLOB, or
DBCLOB. In this case, CLOB AS LOCATOR or DBCLOB AS LOCATOR is not considered a CLOB or DBCLOB.
v FOR BIT DATA, CCSID 65535, FOR MIXED DATA, FOR SBCS DATA is specified and the variable is defined as
graphic, varying-length graphic, or DBCLOB.
v FOR BIT DATA, or CCSID 65535 is specified and the variable is defined as CLOB.

specified two or more times in one DECLARE VARIABLE statement. A host variable can be specified once at most in
a DECLARE VARIABLE statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Specify the host variable at most once in a DECLARE VARIABLE statement.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNH5036I CCSID VALUE OUT OF RANGE
Explanation: The CCSID for a DECLARE VARIABLE or CAST statement is outside the range of 1 to 65533, or the
the value 65535. The value must be within the range of 1 to 65533, or the value must be 65535.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: If this message is issued for a "DECLARE VARIABLE CCSID integer"or "CAST CCSID integer"
statement, change the value to be within the range of 1 to 65533 or the value 65535. If this message is issued for a
DECLARE VARIABLE statement with the "FOR SBCS DATA" or "FOR MIXED DATA" clause, then the CCSIDs
specified on panel DSNTIPF at installation time need to be updated with valid values.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNH5037I DECLARE VARIABLE STATEMENT FOUND WITH ONE-PASS PRECOMPILATION
Explanation: A DECLARE VARIABLE statement was found, but the source program is being precompiled with only
one pass. If a DECLARE VARIABLE is used in an assembler source program, the ONEPASS precompiler option must
not be used. If a DECLARE VARIABLE is used in a C, C++, or PL/I source program, the TWOPASS precompiler
option must be used.
System action: The source program cannot be precompiled.
User response: Specify the TWOPASS precompiler option or, for assembler, do not specify the ONEPASS
precompiler option.

DSNH20129I E csectname LINE nnnn COL cc LOCAL SPECIAL REGISTER IS NOT VALID AS USED
Explanation: An attempt was made to reference a special register, but the syntax was invalid for the special register.
The CURRENT PACKAGE PATH special register, or a local special register such as CURRENT SERVER or CURRENT
PACKAGESET cannot be referenced in an assignment statement (SET or VALUES INTO) where the special register is
part of an expression in the source value, or where multiple source values are being assigned to multiple targets.
The only valid uses of these special registers in a SET host-variable statement or VALUES INTO statement are:
v SET :hv= CURRENT APPLICATION ENCODING SCHEME;
v SET :hv= CURRENT SERVER;
v SET :hv= CURRENT PACKAGESET;
v SET :hv= CURRENT PACKAGE PATH;
v VALUES CURRENT APPLICATION ENCODING SCHEME INTO :hv;
v VALUES CURRENT SERVER INTO :hv;

This error can occur when the STACKED keyword is specified in a GET DIAGNOSTICS statement outside of an SQL
procedure.
System action: The statement was processed.
Programmer response: Modify the application logic so that the STACKED diagnostic is only accessed from within a
handler. If the routine is an external SQL procedure, or a host language program then the STACKED keyword cannot
be used.
DSNH20289I INVALID STRING UNIT unit SPECIFIED FOR FUNCTION function-name
Explanation: The statement invoked a built-in function using a string length unit that is not valid with the type of
data that is provided to the function. This can occur for the following reasons:
v Binary data was specified with unit. CODEUNITS16, or CODEUNITS32 are not valid with binary string data.
v Graphic data was specified with OCTETS as the string length unit. OCTETS is not valid with graphic data.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
System programmer response: Change the invocation of the function to remove the invalid string length unit
specification or change it to a valid string length unit for the data type being processed.

that is the object of the RECOVER.
LOGRBA gives the log RBA of the log record that is unavailable.
System action: The resource is not started (or recovered) and remains in the current state. If this is a START
command, the resources are processed normally if there are other databases or spaces to be started and they do not
involve reading the log.
System programmer response: Run the print log map (DSNJU004) utility. This may be run with DB2 up or down.
Find the data set that contains the requested RBA in the output of DSNJU004. If the required RBA is not in a listed
data set, one of the following may have occurred:
v The data set was deleted from the bootstrap data set by a run of the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility. In
this case, rerun the utility to insert the missing data set name. DB2 must be down to run this utility.
v The bootstrap data set has been damaged. In this case, the BSDS must be restored from the dump that occurred
with the most recent archive log data set. DSNJU003 must be run to supply changes that occurred during and after
the last offload operation. Changes may be determined from the operator's console listing.
If a listed log data set contains the required RBA, this message will be preceded by one or more error messages from
the log manager (DSNJ). See these messages for appropriate action.
User response: Resubmit the utility, or reissue the START command, when the problem with the log has been
resolved.
Problem determination: Issue the -DISPLAY command to verify what got started.

System action: Automatic recovery for the page has been scheduled. The current agent will abend with reason code
'00C90105', and a dump will be taken. The page will be unavailable to this and other agents until the online recovery
has completed successfully. Message DSNI010I will be issued, and a 'resource unavailable' condition will be returned
to any agents that attempt to access the page. If the online recovery fails, the page will be marked as broken until it
is repaired or recovered (see message DSNI012I).
User response: Save the dump. Watch for message DSNB215I (indicating successful recovery of the page), or
DSNI012I (indicating failure of recovery of the page).  DSNI012I PAGE LOGICALLY BROKEN TYPE type NAME name MODNAME modname ERQUAL erqual
Explanation: The page identified by TYPE and NAME is logically incorrect. Additional attempts to access the page
will be denied.
The TYPE and NAME identify the resource that is currently unavailable. The TYPE code identifies the type of the
resource as well as the format and content of the resource NAME. Refer to Appendix C, Resource types, on page
1131 for an explanation of resource type codes.

DSNI015I OBJECT name IS ALREADY STARTED FOR RW ACCESS. THE OBJECT WILL REMAIN STARTED FOR RW ACCESS
Explanation: The -START DATABASE command with the ACCESS(FORCE) keyword was entered, but the object
specified was already started for read/write access.
DSNI016I RESOURCE TYPE type NAME name MUST FIRST BE STOPPED BEFORE IT CAN BE STARTED IN A DIFFERENT ACCESS MODE
Explanation: When issuing the -START DATABASE command on the ROSHARE OWNER system, the object to be
started must first be stopped before changing access modes. For example, if a table space in a database defined as
ROSHARE OWNER is started for RW access, before it can be started for RO access it must be stopped via the -STOP
DATABASE command. It can then be started for RO access via the -START DATABASE command.
System action: The -START DATABASE command is not allowed to proceed.
User response: Issue a -STOP DATABASE command to stop the object before attempting to start it.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNI017I RESOURCE TYPE type NAME name IS INCONSISTENT DUE TO ONE OR MORE PENDING STATES
Explanation: There are two possible reasons for this message:
1. The header page of a table space, index, or partition belonging to a database defined as ROSHARE OWNER
could not be marked as consistent during the processing of the STOP DATABASE command because one or more
of the following was true:
v The table space, index, or partition is in recovery pending status.
v The table space, index, or partition is in check pending status.
v The table space, index, or partition has pages in the logical page list (LPL).
v The table space, index, or partition status has a utility in progress (UTUT status on the output from a DISPLAY
DATABASE command).
v The table space, index, or partition has a utility in progress that allows read-only access (UTRO on the output
from a a DISPLAY DATABASE command).
v An I/O error range exists.
2. A retained lock is held on the table space, index, or partition. The retained lock could be signifying a pending
status.
If the STOP DATABASE command was issued without specifying the SPACENAM parameter, then one or more of
the conditions stated above is true for one or more table spaces, indexes, or partitions in the specified database.
System action: For case 1, if the STOP DATABASE command was specified with the SPACENAM parameter, the
table space, index, or partition is stopped. DB2 does not allow access to an inconsistent table space, index, or
partition by any ROSHARE READ system.
For case 2, no access to an inconsistent table space, index, or partition is allowed until the retained lock is released by
the failed system at completion of its restart.
User response: Issue a DISPLAY DATABASE command to display the status of the object in question. Resolve the
pending states and then reissue the STOP DATABASE command to ensure that the consistency indicator is reset.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNI018I UNABLE TO GET LOCK FOR RESOURCE TYPE type NAME name. WILL RETRY TO GET LOCK.
Explanation: The resource identified by 'type' and 'name' could not be locked because of lock contention. The lock
request is made again for this resource.
The 'type' and 'name' identify the resource trying to get a lock. The 'type' code identifies the type of resource as well
as the format and content of the resource 'name'.
Refer to Appendix C, Resource types, on page 1131 for an explanation of resource type codes.
System action: The lock request is made again for the specified resource.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNI019I THE STOP COMMAND FOR OBJECT name WAS OVERRIDDEN BY A START FORCE. THE STOP COMMAND IS IGNORED.
Explanation: The object identified by 'name' was not stopped because a START FORCE command on this object was
subsequently issued and processed.
This message is informational only.
System action: The object is not stopped.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNI020I csect-name UNABLE TO DRAIN RESOURCE TYPE type NAME name. WILL RETRY DRAINING THE RESOURCE.
Explanation: The resource identified by 'type' and 'name' could not be drained. The 'type' code identifies the type of
resource as well as the format and content of the resource 'name'. The drain request is made again for this resource.
Refer to Appendix C, Resource types, on page 1131 for an explanation of resource type codes.
System action: The drain request is made again for the specified resource.
DSNI021I csect-name GRECP OR LPL RECOVERY FOR function-name - ID = function-id TYPE object-type NAME object-name HAS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY.

DSNI023I csect-name PAGE SET dbnam.psnam PART part IS status ON BEHALF OF UR urid. BACKOUT TO logpoint IS REQUIRED.
Explanation: The value of status is either RESTP (Restart Pending) or AREST (Advisory Restart Pending). This
message indicates that the named UR has backout work pending against the named page set or partition. The
backout work for this UR against this page set or partition will be complete after backward processing of the log
reaches the identified logpoint. The value for logpoint will be 'RBA rba' for non-datasharing and 'LRSN lrsn' for
datasharing environments.
For non-partitioned page sets, the partition given in the message is the string n/a.
DSNI024I csect-name BACKOUT PROCESSING IS COMPLETE FOR PAGE SET dbnam.psnam PART part.
Explanation: This message indicates that backout processing is complete for the named table space, index space, or
partition. If the object was in restrictive restart pending state, that state is lifted. If the object was in an advisory
restart pending state, locks held on the object on behalf of postponed abort URs by the DB2 member issuing the
message are released. The advisory restart pending state is lifted if the DB2 member issuing the message is the only
member still contributing to the state.
For non-partitioned page sets, the partition given in the message is the string "n/a".
DSNI025I csect-name THE FAST LOG APPLY PROCESS REQUIRES aaaaaaaa BYTES OF STORAGE, BUT GOT ONLY bbbbbbbb BYTES
Explanation: The Fast Log Apply process could not obtain all the required storage. However, the storage acquired is
enough for the Fast Log Apply process to continue.
System action: The Fast Log Apply process continues with the smaller amount of storage for the log buffers.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNI026I csect-name THE FAST LOG APPLY PROCESS IS DISABLED BECAUSE ALL OF THE ALLOWABLE STORAGE IS EXHAUSTED
Explanation: There is no ssnmDBM1 storage available for the Fast Log Apply process to use. There are too many
jobs (RECOVER or -START DB command) running in parallel.
System action: The recovery of the requested objects continues without the Fast Log Apply process.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNI027I csect-name THE FAST LOG APPLY PROCESS IS DISABLED BECAUSE IT IS UNABLE TO ACQUIRE THE MINIMUM REQUIRED STORAGE
Explanation: There is not enough ssnmDBM1 storage available or reserved for the Fast Log Apply process to use.
System action: The recovery of the requested objects continues without the Fast Log Apply process.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNI028I csect-name THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED LOG RECORDS READ DURING THE FAST LOG APPLY PROCESS IS log-records AND THE NUMBER OF FAST LOG APPLY BUFFERS PROCESSED ARE fla-buffers
Explanation: This informational message is issued during the Fast Log Apply process. log-records indicates the
number of log records that have been applied during the Fast Log Apply process. fla-buffers indicates the number of
buffers used by the Fast Log Apply process.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNI029I csect-name THE FAST LOG APPLY PROCESS IS ACTIVE AND THE AVAILABLE ssnmDBM1 STORAGE IS bytes BYTES
Explanation: This informational message is issued during the Fast Log Apply process for member ssnm. There is
sufficient storage for the Fast Log Apply process to continue, and the remaining amount of available storage is
displayed in hexadecimal as bytes.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNI030I csect-name BACKOUT PROCESSING IS CONTINUING BEYOND THE REQUESTED LIMIT DUE TO CATALOG OR DIRECTORY ACTIVITY OF UR urid.
Explanation: The number of log records requested to be processed during restart's backward phase have been
processed. Under other circumstances further backout processing would be postponed. However, because the
indicated UR has catalog or directory updates that are not backed out yet (and because backout against catalog or
directory page sets cannot be postponed), backout processing is continuing. It will continue until this UR's backout is
complete.
System action: Backout processing continues.
DSNI031I csect-name - LOCK ESCALATION HAS OCCURRED FOR RESOURCE NAME = resource-name, LOCK STATE = lock-state, PLAN NAME : PACKAGE NAME = plan-name:package-name, COLLECTION-ID = collection-id, STATEMENT NUMBER = statement-number, CORRELATION-ID = correlation-id, CONNECTION-ID = connection-id, LUW-ID = luw-id, THREAD-INFO = thread-information
Explanation: Lock escalation has occurred for the specified object.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
resource-name
The name of the escalated resource. The format of resource-name depends on the type of table space:
Simple or partitioned table spaces

v The name of the user's workstation.
v The ID of the user.
v The name of the application.
v The statement type for the previously executed statement: dynamic or static.
v The statement identifier for the previously executed statement, if available. The statement identifier can be
used to identify the particular SQL statement. For static statements, the statement identifier correlates to
the STMT_ID column in the SYSIBM.SYSPACKSTMT table. For dynamic statements, the statement
identifier correlates to the STMT_ID column in the DSN_STATEMENT_CACHE_TABLE table. That
statement might not have contributed to the current failure.
v The name of the role that is associated with the thread.
v The correlation token that can be used to correlate work at the remote system with work performed at the
DB2 subsystem. The correlation token, if available, is enclosed in '<' and '>' characters, and contains three
components, separated by periods:

DSNI032I csect-name CANCEL THREAD NOBACKOUT COMMAND FAILED FOR THE THREAD = token REASON = reason
Explanation: DB2 displays this message when it cannot grant a request to cancel a thread without backing out data
changes. The reason code explains why the request was rejected.
token Identifies a thread whose processing you requested to cancel. The token is a 1- to 15-digit decimal number.
reason Indicates the reason why the command failed.
System action: Processing terminates normally.
User response: The reason code specifies the action to be taken.
DSNI033I csect-name PAGE SET dbname.psname PART part-number IS MARKED REFP AND status ON BEHALF OF UR ur-id. RECOVERY TO logout IS REQUIRED.
Explanation: No further backout processing will be attempted on the specified page set or partition because backout
for the specified unit of recovery was canceled. The specified page set or partition is placed in refresh-pending
(REFP) status.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
dbname.psname
The database and page set.
part-number
The value that identifies the partition or data set.
status Additional status set on the specified object.
ur-id The unit of recovery.
logout RBA or LRSN value.
User response: If the object in refresh-pending status is a table space, you can resolve the REFP,LPL state of the
specified page set or partition in one of the following ways:
v Run the RECOVER utility to perform a point-in-time recovery.
v Run the LOAD utility with the REPLACE option to resolve the REFP,LPL state.
If the page set is an index space, run the REBUILD INDEX utility to perform a point-in-time recovery and resolve the
REFP,RBDP or REFP,LPL status. You can use the RBA or LRSN value in this message for point-in-time recovery.
The DSNI033I message might be issued multiple times for a page set. (The message is issued once per unit of
recovery.) If you run the RECOVER utility with point-in-time recovery to resolve the exception states, use the highest
of the logout points.

DSNI034I csect-name TABLE SPACE table-space-name IS IN AUX WARNING STATE
Explanation: DB2 attempted to recover table space table-space-name, but no log records exist because the table space
was created with the LOG NO option. The table space is placed in an auxiliary warning state. You can use SQL
statements to update the LOB values that are in error or to delete the row that contains the LOB values. In addition,
you can use SQL statements to access valid LOBs. However, you cannot use SQL statements to retrieve a LOB value
that is not valid.
System action: DB2 marks the LOB values that are in error as not valid. Processing continues.
Programmer response: Use SQL statements to update or delete the LOB values in error. Use the CHECK LOB utility
to verify that all errors were corrected and to reset the auxiliary warning state. The auxiliary warning state can also
be reset using the REPAIR utility with SET NOAUXWARN.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNI036I csect-name THE REAL-TIME STATISTICS COLLECTION PROCESS IS DISABLED
Explanation: An error prevents DB2 from externalizing the in-memory statistics. The error is generally a persistent
error and must be remedied before the process can be enabled. Look for prior messages to identify the nature of the
problem.
System action: The statistics database is implicitly stopped and no further attempt will be made to externalize the
in-memory statistics.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Inspect the console for prior messages and refer to those messages for problem
determination.
DSNI037I csect-name THE REAL-TIME STATISTICS COLLECTION PROCESS COULD NOT ACCESS AN OBJECT IN THE REAL-TIME STATISTICS DATABASE
Explanation: An error prevents DB2 from externalizing the in-memory statistics. An attempt failed to insert, update,
or delete a row in the statistics database. The error is generally transient (lock timeout or resource unavailable). If the
operation is retried, it is likely to succeed.
System action: The statistics are kept in-memory until the next opportunity to externalize them.
DSNI038I csect-name THE REAL-TIME STATISTICS COLLECTION PROCESS IS ENABLED
Explanation: The statistics database started successfully. The required object descriptors in the statistics database
exist and have the correct attributes. DB2 proceeds to externalize in-memory statistics for all modified objects.
System action: The database is started R/w.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNI040I csect-name RESTORE SYSTEM UTILITY PROCESSING LOG RANGE FROM rba/lrsn xxxxxx TO yyyyyy
Explanation: This message periodically shows the progress of system level recovery made by the RESTORE
SYSTEM utility. In non-data sharing, the log range is RBA. In data sharing, the log range represents LRSN value. The
value for xxxxxxxx is the RBA or LRSN value of the current log record being processed and the yyyyyyyy value is the
RBA or LRSN of the last log record to be processed by the RESTORE SYSTEM utility.
System action: System Level Point-In-Time recovery continues.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNI041I csect-name START ACCESS(FORCE) CANNOT BE ISSUED AGAINST TARGET obj-type obj-qual.obj-name part DUE TO STOPPED UTILITIES ON VERSION version-number. REQUEST IS REJECTED.
Explanation: The object cannot be started due to outstanding utilities on a different version. The status of the object
is unchanged.
version-number is the version on which the utility was running.
obj-type is table space or index space.
obj-qual is the database name.
obj_name is the table space or index space name.
part represents the partition number for a partitioned table space.
System action: The request is rejected.
User response: Use the DISPLAY UTILITY command to see what utilities are outstanding. Issue the -START
DATABASE ACCESS(FORCE) command on the same version as the version on which the stopped utility was
running. If there is more than one utility outstanding on the object and the utilities were submitted on a different
release of DB2, start the correct version of DB2 and use the -TERM UTILITY command to terminate each utility.

DSNI045I OPEN FAILED FOR DB dbname SPACE NAME tsname, PART partno
Explanation: The data set for the database name, space name, and partition number failed to be physically opened
through an -ACCESS DATABASE command with keyword MODE(OPEN). PART will be unavailable for
non-partitioned data sets.
Operator response: Examine the console for other related error messages. Ensure the bufferpool is activated, and
then re-issue the command. If the failure persists, then contact DB2 Technical Support.
DSNI046I csect-name OBJECT IN ERROR REASON reason-code ERQUAL error-qualifier NAME object-name DBID database-id OBID object-id LRSN log-record>
Explanation: An error occurred during processing of a table space, table space partition, index space, index
partition, or logical index partition. One of the following conditions occurred:
v An error occurred when DB2 processed a DBET exception state for a table space, index space, or partition of a
partitioned object.
v An error occurred when DB2 was unable to access a page set in backward log recovery phase during restart.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
reason-code
The DB2 reason code that is listed in the dump that accompanies this message.
error-qualifier
The abend in the control section that caused this message to be issued.
object-name
The name of the table space or index space that encountered the problem. A partition number is included
where applicable.
database-id
The database identifier (DBID).
object-id
The object identifier (OBID).
log-record
The LRSN or RBA of the log record that was being processed when the error occurred. If no log record was
being processed, this value is blank.
System action: The system action depends on the situation in which the error occurred:
Accessing a page in backward log recovery phase
DB2 places the table space or index space in RECP and DBETE status. It then abends and generates a dump.
DB2 tolerates the page set access error so that it can restart.
Processing a DBET exception state
DB2 places the table space or index space in RECP, RBDP, or PSRBD status and DBETE status. It then
abends and generates a dump. DB2 tolerates the exception state error so that it can restart or the RESTORE
SYSTEM utility can continue.
User response: Issue the appropriate DISPLAY command to see the status of the object. Use one of the following
methods to reset the DBETE and RECP, RBDP, or PSRBD statuses:
v Use the RECOVER utility or the LOAD utility with the REPLACE option to recover a table space or index space.
v Use the REBUILD INDEX utility to rebuild an index space.
v Use the START DATABASE command with the following options:
START DATABASE(database-name)
SP(space-name) ACCESS(FORCE)
Contact IBM Software Support to report the problem. DB2 log records need to be analyzed in order to diagnose the
cause of the problem, and determine if the exception state error needs to be handled.

DSNI047I csect-name UNABLE TO ACCESS OBJECT TYPE object-type OBJECT NAME object-name REASON reason TYPE type NAME name
Explanation: The resource identified could not be accessed because it was unavailable. The resource could be a
database, a table space, an index space, or a partition within a table space or index space. The object-type identifies
the type. The object-name identifies the name. If the DB2 catalog is unavailable, then object-type contains binary zeros
and object-name contains blanks.
The resource that was unavailable is identified by type and name. The type code identifies the type of the resource, as
well as the format and content of the name. The reason contains the reason code explaining why the resource was
unavailable.
System action: The specified database, space, or partition is not accessed, and remains in tis current state. If there
are other databases , spaces, or partitions to be accessed, they are processed normally.
User response: Correct the resource unavailable problem and reissue the -ACCESS DATABASE command.

DSNI048I mod-name CLAIMERS EXIST FOR DATABASE dbname, SPACE NAME tsname, PART partno. GROUP BUFFERPOOL DEPENDENCY CANNOT BE REMOVED.
Explanation: An -ACCESS DATABASE MODE(NGBPDEP) command was issued while one or more claimers still
exist for the indicated object. DB2 cannot remove group buffer pool dependency while the claimers still exist. PART is
not available for non-partitioned page sets.
Operator response: Use the -DISPLAY DATABASE CLAIMERS command to determine which threads hold claims
that are blocking the ACCESS DATABASE MODE(NGBPDEP) command. Reissue the command after these threads
have released their claims. Only write claimers will block the command on the member to which the command is
issued. For all other members, either a read claimer or a write claimer will block the command.
DSNI049I csect-name GRECP OR LPL RECOVERY FOR function-name - ID = function-id HAS COMPLETED.
Explanation: The group buffer pool recovery pending (GRECP) or logical page list (LPL) exception state of table
spaces or index spaces in a recovery function has been completed.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
function-name
The function that triggered the recovery: Expected values are:
v START DATABASE COMMAND
v AUTOMATIC GRECP RECOVERY
v AUTOMATIC LPL RECOVERY
function-id
A decimal number that represents a recovery function. This number corresponds to the function ID number
in DSNI006I and DSNI021I messages.
Messages DSNI006I (beginning of recovery) and DSNI021I (end of recovery) report about recovering a single table
space or index space within a recovery function. A recovery function can recover multiple objects.
Message DSNI049I indicates the end of a recovery function.
System action: The recovery function that is identified by function-name completes normally.
Operator response: No action is required.

DSNJ001I csect-name CURRENT COPY n ACTIVE LOG DATA SET IS DSNAME=..., STARTRBA=..., ENDRBA=...
Explanation: This message is generated for one of two reasons:
1. When the log manager is initialized, it sends this informational message to identify the current active log data
sets (copy-1 and, if dual logging is used, copy-2).
2. When the current active log data set is full, DB2 will switch to the next available active log data set. This message
identifies the next available active log data set which will be used for logging.
The value specified by the STARTRBA=value keyword is the RBA of the first byte of log data in the named data set.
The value specified by the ENDRBA=value keyword is the RBA of the last possible byte in the data set. These values
may later be needed for a conditional restart.
System programmer response: None required. However, if recovery is required, information from this message may
be required as input to the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility.
DSNJ002I FULL ACTIVE LOG DATA SET DSNAME=..., STARTRBA=..., ENDRBA=...
Explanation: This message is sent at the time the log manager fills an active log data set and switches to a new
empty data set. The message shows the name and log RBA range of the full data set.
System programmer response: None required. However, if recovery is required information from this message may
be required as input to the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility.
DSNJ003I csect-name FULL ARCHIVE LOG VOLUME DSNAME=..., STARTRBA=..., ENDRBA=..., STARTxxxx=..., ENDxxxx=..., UNIT=..., COPYnVOL=..., VOLSPAN=..., CATLG=...
Explanation: Offloading for the specified archive log data set was successfully completed for the given volume. If
the data set spans multiple tape volumes, this message is generated for each tape volume. If the data set spans
multiple DASD volumes, only one message will be generated displaying the first VOLSER, appended with a plus
sign ('+') to indicate the data set spans multiple volumes. 'xxxx' is replaced by either TIME or LRSN.
System action: An archive log data set has been created, and the archive log data set inventory in the bootstrap data
set (BSDS) has been updated with the information in the message:
DSNAME
The name of the archive log data set.
STARTRBA
The starting RBA contained in the volume.
ENDRBA
The ending RBA contained in the volume.
STARTLRSN
The starting LRSN contained in the volume for data sharing systems.
ENDLRSN
The ending LRSN contained in the volume for data sharing systems.
STARTTIME
The starting store-clock value of the log records in the volume for non-data sharing systems.
ENDTIME
The ending store-clock value of the log records in the volume for non-data sharing systems.
UNIT The device unit to which the data set was allocated.
COPYnVOL
The name of the volume. This message keyword is displayed as COPY1VOL if this is the copy-1 archive log
data set, and as COPY2VOL if this is the copy-2 archive log data set.
VOLSPAN
An indicator to denote one of four conditions:
v If '00', the data set is entirely contained on the volume specified by 'COPYnVOL'.
v If '01', this is the first entry of a multivolume data set.
v If '11', this is the middle entry of a multivolume data set.
v If '10', this is the last entry of a multivolume data set.
CATLG
An indicator to denote one of two conditions:
v If 'NO', the archive log data set is uncataloged.
v If 'YES', the archive log data set is cataloged.
The BSDS is automatically updated with the information contained in this message; however, if recovery is required,
information from this message may be required as input to the change log inventory utility (DSNJU003).
DSNJ004I ACTIVE LOG COPY n INACTIVE, LOG IN SINGLE MODE, ENDRBA=...
Explanation: This message is sent when the dual active logging option is selected and copy 'n' becomes inactive. A
log copy becomes inactive when the next active log data set is not ready when required. ENDRBA is the last byte of
log data written on copy 'n'. This is usually caused by a delay in off-load.
System action: The log is switched to single mode until the next data set for copy 'n' is ready for logging.
If DB2 is shut down or abends while in single mode with the ZPARM option still set for dual active data sets, the
previous state of the active log data sets determines what happens when DB2 is started, as follows:
v If fewer than two data sets are available (not flagged as STOPPED) for each set of active logs, DB2 startup
terminates and message DSNJ112E is issued.
v If an active log data set is in NOTREUSABLE state, DB2 can be started in single logging mode, but dual mode
takes effect when the other active log data set becomes available after offloading.
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
Operator response: Execute an MVS Display System Requests command (D R,L for example) to ensure that there are
no outstanding requests that are related to the log off-load process. Take the necessary action to satisfy any requests,
and permit off-load to continue.
System programmer response: If the switch to single mode was caused by the lack of a resource required for
off-load, the necessary resource should be made available to allow off-load to complete and thus permit dual logging
to proceed. If recovery is required, information from this message might be required as input to the change log
inventory (DSNJU003) utility.
DSNJ005I ACTIVE LOG COPY n IS ACTIVE, LOG IN DUAL MODE, STARTRBA=...
Explanation: This message is sent when copy 'n' of the log becomes active after previously being flagged as inactive.
STARTRBA is the RBA of the first byte of log data written on copy 'n' after it was activated.
System programmer response: None required. However, if recovery is required, information from this message may
be required as input to the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility.
DSNJ006I ALLOCATION FOR NEW ARCHIVE LOG DATA SET HAS BEEN CANCELLED BY OPERATOR.
Explanation: This message is sent if the operator answers 'N' to the WTOR message DSNJ008E.
System action: If the allocation is for copy 1 archive log data set, offload terminates processing until the next time it
is activated. If copy 1 has already been allocated and this request is for copy 2, offload switches to single offload
mode for this data set only.
DSNJ007I csect-name OPERATOR CANCELED MOUNT OF ARCHIVE VOL SER= volser
Explanation: If the operator answers 'N' to the WTOR message DSNJ009I, this message is issued. The variable
'volser' is the volume serial of an archive log volume required for the read request.
System action: The read request for the archive log volume fails. If the request was issued with the COND=YES
parameter, return code 12 and reason code 00D1032B are returned to the requester. Otherwise, DB2 abends with
reason code 00D1032B.
DSNJ008E nn OF mm ACTIVE LOGS ARE FULL. ssname NEEDS ARCHIVE SCRATCH. REPLY Y WHEN DEVICE READY OR N TO CANCEL.
Explanation: The installation has requested a WTOR before archive log data set allocation. DB2 needs a scratch
volume for offloading an active log data set.
ssname The name of the DB2 subsystem.
nn The number of full active log data sets.
mm The total number of active log data sets.
System action: The offload task waits for the operator's reply.
Operator response: The operator has three options:
v Get a scratch volume ready, make sure there is an available unit for the volume, and reply 'Y'. DB2 then continues
with the offload.
v Determine from the number of active log data sets available whether the offload can be delayed until the next time
an active log data set becomes full. If the process can be delayed, then reply 'N'.
This response has two possible effects.
C If dual archive logging is in effect and this allocation is for a copy 1 archive data set, the 'N' response delays the
offload process until the next active log data set becomes full.
C However, if the copy 1 archive data set has already been allocated and this request is for copy 2, the 'N'
response causes the offload to switch to single archive mode (the switch is for this data set only).
v Defer giving a response. This causes offload to wait before processing. However, because offload is a separate
service task, the wait does not affect DB2 performance.
If offloading to DASD, an error has occurred attempting to allocate an archive log data set. Reply 'Y' to receive the
error messages.
DSNJ009E ssname NEEDS VOL SER=nnnnnn. REPLY Y TO CONTINUE OR N TO CANCEL
Explanation: The installation requested WTOR before archive log data set allocation. DB2 needs the specified
archive volume for a read operation. The subsystem name is 'ssname'.
System action: The archive log read service task waits for the operator's reply. This wait affects the agent for which
the log read was issued and any other agents that might be waiting on the log read service task queue.
Operator response: Locate the requested volume, ensure that a device is available, and reply 'Y'. DB2 continues with
dynamic allocation and then begins reading the log.
If dual archiving is in effect, a response of 'N' causes archive read to reissue the message for the copy 'Z' copy 2
archive VOLSER with the same RBA range. A response of 'N' to this second WTOR, or to the initial WTOR for single
archiving, causes the archive read service task to fail with unpredictable results.
DSNJ010I csect-name INVALID RESPONSE. WTOR WILL BE REPEATED.
Explanation: A WTOR was issued during archive data set allocation. The user did not respond correctly to the
message. Either 'Y' or 'N' must be entered.
System action: The original WTOR is repeated.
Operator response: Reply as indicated in the repeated message.
DSNJ011I CONDITIONAL RESTART RECORD record-identifier CREATED AT timestamp WAS FOUND. REPLY Y TO USE, N TO CANCEL
Explanation: When the log manager was initialized, a conditional restart control record was found in the bootstrap
data set.
This message provides the following information to help identify the conditional restart record that will be used:
v A record identifier, which is a 4 byte hexadecimal number
v The creation timestamp, in the format yy.ddd hh:mm:
yy Two-digit indicator for the year.
ddd Three-digit indicator for the day of the year.
hh:mm Indicator for the time of the day.
System action: The system action depends on the reply.
'Y' DB2 is started conditionally, using the record that was found.
'N' DB2 startup terminates.
Operator response: If a DB2 conditional restart is to be done and if the date and time displayed are correct, then
reply 'Y' to the outstanding message. If you are not sure, or if you do not want to use the indicated record, contact
the system programmer.
System programmer response: If a normal restart of DB2 has failed and you have created a conditional restart
control record with the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility, check whether the time and date in the message
agree with when you created that record. If they do agree, reply 'Y' to the outstanding WTOR. If they do not, reply
'N' and investigate the discrepancy.

DSNJ012I ERROR ccc READING RBA rrr IN DATA SET ddd CONNECTION-ID=xxxxxxxx, CORRELATION-ID=yyyyyyyyyyyy
Explanation: While scanning log records read into a buffer, the log manager detected a logical error with reason
code 'ccc'. 'rrr' is the log RBA of the segment in the buffer at which the error was detected. 'ddd' is the name of the
active or archive log data set from which the record was read. If 'ddd' is blank, the data was read from an active log
output buffer.
The connection and correlation IDs identify the user or application that encountered the problem. Messages that have
the same connection ID and correlation ID relate to the same user. Correlation IDs beginning with '0nn' where 'nn' is
a number from 01 to 28, identify system agents.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference. for information
about recovery from log failures.
System action: The application program that invoked the log manager is terminated with reason code 'ccc'.
However, information in this message may be useful in diagnosing the abend that will follow.
DSNJ013I TERMINAL ERROR ccc IN BUFFER rrr BEFORE ACTIVE LOG WRITE
Explanation: A scan of the log output buffer just prior to writing the buffer detected an inconsistency in the log
data. 'ccc' is the abend reason code associated with the SDUMP that is produced. 'rrr' is the log RBA at which the
error was detected.
System action: DB2 will terminate with a dump, and will not write the damaged buffer to either COPY 1 or COPY
2 active log data set.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer. Start DB2 after it terminates.
System programmer response: Because the damaged buffer has not been written to a log data set, DB2 may be
restarted. No corrective action is required.
Problem determination: In the DB2 formatted block section of the dump, locate the chain of LBCE blocks. Those are
log buffer control elements, and each LBCE controls one 4KB log output buffer. LBCEBUFF, at offset X'20' in the
LBCE, points to the buffer, which is always on a 4KB boundary. The log RBA of the first byte of the buffer is in a
6-byte field at offset X'FF2' in the buffer itself. The layout of the buffer is described by the DSNDLCID mapping
macro. The header of each record within the buffer is described by the DSNDLRH mapping macro. Locate the buffer
that contains the log RBA from the message and find the damage by referring to the description of the reason code
later in this book.
DSNJ014I TERMINAL ERROR ccc IN BUFFER rrr AFTER ACTIVE LOG WRITE.
Explanation: A scan of the log output buffer, after writing to the COPY 1 active log data set and before writing to
COPY 2, detected an inconsistency in the log data. 'ccc' is the abend reason code associated with the SDUMP that is
produced. 'rrr' is the log RBA at which the error was detected.
System action: DB2 will terminate with a dump, and will not write the damaged buffer to the COPY 2 data set.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: The block containing the indicated log RBA may be damaged. The buffer was found
to be in error at the completion of the write to the COPY 1 data set of the active log.
If dual active logs are being used, use print log map (DSNJU004) to list the active log data sets for both copies of the
active log. Find the COPY 2 data set with the corresponding RBA, and copy that data set (using access method
services REPRO) to the COPY 1 data set. Start DB2.
If only a single active log is used, contact the IBM support center for assistance. An attempt to start DB2 may succeed
if the damage to the buffer occurred after completion of the write to DASD.
Problem determination: In the DB2 formatted block section of the dump, locate the chain of LBCE blocks. Those are
log buffer control elements, and each LBCE controls one 4KB log output buffer. LBCEBUFF, at offset X'20' in the
LBCE points to the buffer, which is always on a 4KB boundary. The log RBA of the first byte of the buffer is in a
6-byte field at offset X'FF2' in the buffer itself. The layout of the buffer is described by the DSNDLCID mapping
macro. The header of each record within the buffer is described by the DSNDLRH mapping macro. Locate the buffer
that contains the log RBA from the message and find the damage by referring to the description of the reason code
later in this book.
DSNJ015I CSRONLY PROHIBITS LOG ALTERATIONS. RECORD rrr CREATED .... REPLY Y TO USE, N TO CANCEL.
Explanation: During DB2 startup, the log manager found an inactive conditional restart control record in the
bootstrap data set. Because this control record indicates CSRONLY, no log data sets will be modified. If log truncation
was specified, it will be simulated. Only the first phase of restart (current status rebuild) will be performed. The
hexadecimal identifier (rrr) and creation timestamp (yy.ddd hh:mm) identify the record found.
System action: A 'Y' reply will continue the conditional restart. A 'N' reply will terminate DB2 startup.
Operator response: To continue this CSRONLY processing, reply 'Y' to this message. If you are not sure, contact the
system programmer.
System programmer response: The conditional restart control record will not be deactivated at the end of the
CSRONLY processing. To deactivate this record, either cancel this record or create a new record. If you suspect an
error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem,
see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference. for more information.
DSNJ016E csect-name WARNING - SYSTEM CHECKPOINT PROCESSOR MAY HAVE STALLED. LAST CHECKPOINT WAS TAKEN date-time.
Explanation: While switching active log data sets, DB2 found that there has not been a system checkpoint taken
since the last time DB2 switched active log data sets. date-time is the date and time of the last system checkpoint.
There should be at least one system checkpoint on each log data set.
System action: DB2 continues processing. If statistics class 3 is active, IFCID 0335 is written.
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
This message is deleted when a system checkpoint is taken.
System programmer response: This message might be an indication that the system checkpoint processor may no
longer be functioning. This situation can result in a very long restart if logging continues without a system
checkpoint. You should monitor system checkpoint activity very closely. You can use the -DISPLAY LOG command or
run the Print Log Map utility (DSNJU004) to display the most recent checkpoint. If DB2 continues logging beyond
the defined checkpoint frequency, you should quiesce activity and terminate DB2 to minimize the restart time.
Prior to terminating DB2, obtain a dump of the DB2 address spaces for problem determination.
DSNJ017E csect-name WARNING - OFFLOAD TASK HAS BEEN ACTIVE SINCE date-time AND MAY HAVE STALLED.
Explanation: While switching active log data sets, DB2 found that the offload task has been active since the last time
DB2 switched active log data sets. The offload task began archiving an active log data set at date-time.
System action: DB2 continues processing. If statistics class 3 is active, IFCID 0335 is written. This message will be
deleted when the offload task completes the archive process.
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
System programmer response: This may be an indication that there may be an outstanding tape mount request or
that the offload task may no longer be functioning. This situation can result in a log-full situation if DB2 can not
archive log data sets when they fill. You should reply to any tape mount requests and monitor offload activity very
closely. You can issue the -DISPLAY LOG command to display the status of the offload task, and the -ARCHIVE LOG
CANCEL OFFLOAD command can be used to terminate and restart the offload process.
Prior to terminating the offload task, obtain a dump of the DB2 MSTR address space for problem determination.
DSNJ020I csect-name RECEIVED REPLY OF N TO msg-num. SUBSYSTEM STARTUP IS TERMINATED.
Explanation: The operator chose to terminate DB2 startup by answering 'N' to 'msg-num'.
System action: DB2 will not restart.
Operator response: To restart DB2, follow the 'operator response' of 'msg-num'.
DSNJ030I RBA RANGE start-rba TO end-rba NOT AVAILABLE IN ACTIVE LOG DATA SETS
Explanation: Previous errors have made the active log data sets that contain the relative byte address (RBA) range
reported in the message unavailable to DB2. The status of these logs is STOPPED in the bootstrap data set (BSDS).
System action: DB2 terminates with a dump.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: The log RBA range must be available for DB2 to be recoverable. Correct previous
errors and restore the active log data set(s) that contain the RBA range reported in the message.
v If the log data sets are recoverable, the active log data set inventory in the BSDS must be modified to reset the
STOPPED status.
1. Use the print log map (DSNJU004) utility to obtain a copy of the BSDS log inventory.
2. Use the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility to delete the active log data sets that are marked STOPPED,
by using DELETE statements.
3. Add the data sets again by using NEWLOG statements of the DSNJU003 utility. The starting and ending RBA
for each active log data set must be specified on the NEWLOG statements.
v If the log data sets are not recoverable, conditionally restart DB2.
Problem determination: Examine previous messages to determine the reason the active log data sets are unavailable
to DB2.

System action: Processing continues. If statistics class 3 is active, IFCID 0313 is written.
This message is repeated each time the threshold is reached.
System programmer response: Consult with the application programmer to determine if this UR is problematic.
If an application program caused the UR to reach its threshold number of log records, you can use CANCEL
THREAD (token) to cancel the UR. If you cancel an uncommitted UR, DB2 rolls back the changes. The amount of
time that is required for this process depends on the amount of work that was done by the UR.
Programmer response: Ensure that the application commits frequently enough, or consult with your DB2
administrator about increasing the threshold number of log records. Use the URLGWTH subsystem parameter.

DSNJ032I csect-name alert-level- APPROACHING END OF THE LOG RBA RANGE OF maximum-value.  CURRENT LOG RBA IS current-level
Explanation: The current log RBA is approaching the end of the log RBA range. The current log RBA should not be
allowed to advance to the maximum-value.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
alert-level
The type of alert, based on the current log RBA level:
WARNING
The current log RBA reached x'F00000000000'.
CRITICAL
The current log RBA value reached x'FFFF00000000'.
maximum-value
The maximum value is FFFFFFFFFFFF.
current-level
The current log RBA value.
System action: DB2 continues processing if the alert-level value is WARNING or if DB2 is restarting. Otherwise, DB2
terminates with reason code 00D10251.
Any attempt to restart DB2 in general access mode, following the termination will cause DB2 to restart in light mode,
and DB2 will shut down after restart completes the recovery of the incomplete units-of-recovery.
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
If DB2 terminates and restarts in light mode, wait until it completes the recovery of incomplete units-of-recovery, and
then restart it in ACCESS(MAINT) mode to recover any indoubt units-of-recovery, start any table spaces in a
restricted state such as LPL or GRECP, or terminate any utilities that are in progress.
System programmer response: Use the instructions for resetting the log RBA to determine when to reset the log and
how to reset it, depending on your data sharing environment.

DSNJ050I LOAD MODULE DSNJL003 DOES NOT HAVE RMODE(24) ATTRIBUTE
Explanation: The named load module was not link edited with the required RMODE(24) attribute.
System action: DB2 startup is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer of the failure.
System programmer response: Verify that all installation and maintenance activities against this module were
executed using SMP. Verify that the JCLIN for SMP includes the correct RMODE control statement, and that the
Linkage Editor provided with the Data Facility Product (DFP) for the version of MVS being used was invoked by
SMP for the link edits. Correct the procedure or JCL which caused the error and rerun the necessary SMP jobs.
Problem determination: The MVS service aid AMBLIST provides Linkage Editor module attributes in the summary
section of the LISTLOAD function output.
DSNJ070I csect-name ARCHIVE LOG DSN PREFIX NOT IN PROPER FORMAT TO RECEIVE TIMESTAMP DATA. TIMESTAMPING OF dsnname BYPASSED
Explanation: By way of a ZPARM parameter, the user has specified that the date and time of creation of an archive
log data set be included as part of the archive log data set name (DSN). To accomplish this, the DB2 subsystem
requires that the length of the archive log data set name prefix not exceed 19 characters if using the standard DATE
format (YYDDD), or 17 characters if using the extended DATE format (YYYYDDD). If the prefix requirement is not
met, this message is issued just prior to the allocation of the archive log data set specified in the message.
System action: The archive log data set will be allocated using the archive log prefix. However, the archive log DSN
will not contain the date and time as the user requested.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: The values of TSTAMP and ARCPFXn subsystem parameters are not consistent with
one another and must be changed.

DSNJ071I csect-name TIMER FAILURE CAUSED TIMESTAMPING OF ARCHIVE dsname TO BE BYPASSED
Explanation: By way of a ZPARM parameter, the user has specified that the date and time of creation of an archive
log data set be included as part of the archive log data set name (DSN). However an attempt to get the current date
and time from the system failed. This message is issued just prior to the allocation of the archive log data set
specified in the message.
System action: The archive log data set will be allocated using the archive log prefix. However, the archive log DSN
will not contain the date and time as the user requested.
DSNJ072E ARCHIVE LOG DATA SET dsname HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO NON-TAPE DEVICE AND CATALOGED. ZPARM CATALOG OPTION OF 'NO' HAS BEEN OVERRIDDEN.
Explanation: The following archive log subsystem parameters specified that all archive log data sets are to be
allocated to a non-tape device and uncataloged:
v The UNIT subsystem parameter specified a non-tape device.
v The CATALOG subsystem parameter value was specified as NO.
However, DB2 requires that all archive log data sets that are allocated to non-tape devices must be cataloged.
dsname The archive log data set.
System action: The specified archive log data set was allocated to a non-tape device, as specified by the UNIT
subsystem parameter, and was cataloged. The specified CATALOG subsystem parameter value of NO was
overridden. The BSDS reflects that the data set was cataloged.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Change the values of the UNIT and CATALOG subsystem parameters so that they
are consistent with one another

DSNJ073I LOG ARCHIVE UNIT ALLOCATION FAILURE DETECTED, RETURN CODE=nnnn.  ALLOCATION OR OFFLOAD OF ARCHIVE LOG DATA SET MAY FAIL.
Explanation: While building the SVC99 text entries to dynamically allocate a new archive log data set, a unit
allocation failure was detected. This message is only generated when a trace for IFCID 320 is active. The reason code,
indicated by 'nnnn' in the message, further clarifies the problem as follows:
4 (X'04')
The device type (unit name) on which the archive log data set is to be allocated is specified by the user in
the DB2 system parameters. No UCBs could be found for the device type (unit name).
8 (X'08')
The device type (unit name) on which the archive log data set is to be allocated is specified by the user in
the DB2 system parameters. This device type (unit name) could not be found in the MVS eligible device
table (EDT).
32 (X'20')
DB2 was able to obtain a list of devices corresponding to the device type (unit name) specified in ZPARMs.
However, it was determined by DB2 that this list contained a mixture of tape and nontape devices.
40 (X'28')
The device type (unit name) specified by the user in ZPARMs is valid. However, no devices are currently
associated with the given device type (unit name).
44 (X'2C')
The device type (unit name) specified by the user in ZPARMs is valid. However, no DASD volumes are
available with a volume use attribute of 'storage'.
48 (X'30')
The CVT indicates that UCB services are not available.
System action: This message is issued by DB2 after the SVC99 text entries are built, but prior to the allocation of the
new archive log data set. As a result of the error, the dynamic allocation of the archive log data set will be attempted
using standard default values. The standard default values are generally acceptable; however, the allocation may fail
or the subsequent offload may produce undesirable processing results. For example:
v A return code of 4 or 44 (X'2C') will foretell an allocation error (DSNJ103I) when the SVC99 is issued for the
archive data set.
v Offload processing to tape may fail. DB2 uses a volume count of 20 when allocating to tape, and uses the standard
MVS volume count default of 5 volumes when writing to nontape devices. In the case of most of the above errors,
it would be impossible for the DB2 subsystem to determine the device type on which the data set is to be
allocated. Therefore, the standard MVS default is assumed for the volume count. If the data set is successfully
allocated to a tape device, and the volume of data is such that more than five volumes will be used for the archive
data set, the offload processing will receive an MVS ABEND 837-08 with message IEC028I when attempting to
write to the sixth tape volume.
v Offload processing to a direct access device may fail. When allocating a new archive log data set on a direct access
device, the DB2 subsystem will use a unit count to facilitate multivolume archive data sets. With most of the above
errors, it may be impossible for the DB2 subsystem to correctly determine the type of device on which the data set
is to be allocated. Therefore, the standard default (1) is assumed for the unit count. If the data set is successfully
allocated to a direct access device, and during the offload processing it becomes necessary to extend the data set to
another device, the offload processing will receive an MVS B37 (out of space) ABEND, and the archive log data set
will be deallocated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: The required action is based on the return code indicated in the message.
4 (X'04') or 8 (X'08')
The most likely cause is an incorrect specification in the archive log ZPARMs (DSNTIPA panel). Correct the
DEVICE TYPE field. If the DEVICE TYPE field from the archive log ZPARMs appears to be correct, check
the EDT to ensure that the esoteric or generic unit name specified in the ZPARMs is actually in the EDT.
Subsequent offload processing will archive the log data which could not be previously archived due to the
allocation failure (DSNJ103I).
32 (X'20') or 40 (X'28')
To correct this situation, change the archive log DEVICE TYPE ZPARM to use a device type (unit name)
which contains homogenous devices, or modify the device list associated with the device type (unit name)
via a system generation to supply a list of homogenous devices.
44 (X'2C')
To correct this situation, issue an MVS mount command to change the volume use attribute of a mounted
'private' volume to 'storage'. If this is a recurring problem, a system generation may be required to add
permanently resident volumes with a volume use attribute of 'storage' to the esoteric or generic unit, or
ZPARMs may have to be changed to use a different esoteric or generic unit name for the DEVICE TYPE (on
the DSNTIPA installation panel).
48 (X'30')
UCB services became available in MVS/ESA Version 4.1 (HBB4410).
DSNJ096E csect-name CRCR ENDLRSN RBA VALUE OF rrr IS INVALID, NO TRUNCATION WILL OCCUR
Explanation: Truncation cannot take place because the RBA value specified on the active CRCR record is not equal
to the RBA of a log record. rrr is the ENDLRSN specified in the active record. The ENDLRSN RBA value must match
the start of a log record in a non-data sharing environment.
System action: DB2 startup is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Confirm that the ENDLRSN value specified in the Conditional Restart control record
is correct. Run the Change Log Inventory (DSNJU003) utility with the CRESTART CANCEL parameters to cancel the
conditional restart. If log truncation is needed, run the DSNJU003 utility with the correct ENDLRSN value. Restart
DB2.
DSNJ098E csect-name CRCR ENDLRSN OF rrr IS xxx THAN ANY KNOWN yyyy, NO TRUNCATION WILL OCCUR
Explanation: Truncation cannot take place because the CRCR ENDLRSN is not in the range of LRSN or RBA values
known to either the active or archive logs. rrr is the end LRSN specified in the active record. xxx is replaced by either
HIGHER or LOWER. In a data sharing environment, if xxx is HIGHER, the CRCR ENDLRSN is higher than the
LRSN of the last record written to the log data sets. If xxx is LOWER, the CRCR ENDLRSN is lower than the starting
LRSN of the oldest archive data set. yyyy is replaced by LRSN. In a non-data sharing environment, if xxx is HIGHER,
the CRCR ENDLRSN is higher than the RBA of the last record written to the log data sets. If xxx is LOWER, the
CRCR ENDLRSN value is an RBA value that is lower than the starting LRSN of the oldest archive data set. yyyy is
replaced by RBA.
System action: DB2 startup is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Confirm that the ENDLRSN value specified in the Conditional Restart control record
is correct. If it is not correct, run the Change Log Inventory (DSNJU003) utility with the CRESTART CANCEL
parameters to cancel the conditional restart. If log truncation is needed, run the DSNJU003 utility with the correct
ENDLRSN. Restart DB2.
DSNJ099I LOG RECORDING TO COMMENCE WITH STARTRBA=...
Explanation: This message is generated when the log manager is initialized during DB2 startup. The value specified
by the STARTRBA=value keyword is the RBA of the next byte of log data to be recorded in the DB2 active log data
set(s). This information may later be needed for a conditional restart.
This message is preceded by one DSNJ001I message (if single logging) or two DSNJ001I messages (if dual logging).
System programmer response: None required. However, if recovery is required, information from this message may
be required as input to the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility.
DSNJ100I csect-name ERROR OPENING BSDSn DSNAME=..., ERROR STATUS=eeii
Explanation: Log manager initialization or the -RECOVER BSDS command could not open the specified bootstrap
data set (BSDS). BSDSn matches the ddname in the log startup JCL of the data set that cannot be opened. The value
of n is 1 or 2. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about
identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
for information about recovery from BSDS or log failures.
System action: When this error occurs at initialization time, DB2 startup must be terminated, because the log data
sets cannot be determined and allocated without the BSDS. When this error occurs during -RECOVER BSDS
processing, the command is terminated, and the system continues in single BSDS mode.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Recover the BSDS that cannot be opened. Normally, if dual BSDSs are being used,
recovery consists of making a copy of the remaining good BSDS.
Problem determination: The 'error status' contains the VSAM open return code in 'ee', and the VSAM open reason
code in 'ii'. Refer to z/OS DFSMS: Macro Instructions for Data Sets for a list of the VSAM open return codes and reason
codes, and the steps required to take corrective action.
DSNJ101E csect-name CRCRERBA OF rrr IS xxx THAN ANY KNOWN RBA, BUT COLD START WAS NOT SPECIFIED
Explanation: Truncation cannot take place because the CRCR end RBA is not in the range of RBA values known to
either the active or archive logs. 'rrr' is the end RBA specified in the active record. 'xxx' is replaced by either HIGHER
or LOWER. If HIGHER is the case, the CRCRERBA is higher than the end RBA of the most recent active log data set.
LOWER means the CRCRERBA is lower than the starting RBA of the oldest archive data set.
System action: DB2 startup is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Most likely, the archive log data set that contained the requested RBA has been
deleted from the bootstrap data set (BSDS) by the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility. Locate the output from
an old Print Map run, and identify the data set that contains the missing RBA. If the data set has not been reused,
run the DSNJU003 utility to add this data set back into the inventory of log data sets. Restart DB2.
DSNJ102I LOG RBA CONTENT OF LOG DATA SET DSNAME=..., STARTRBA=..., ENDRBA=..., DOES NOT AGREE WITH BSDS INFORMATION
Explanation: The log RBA range shown in the BSDS for the specified data set does not agree with the content of the
data set. This message indicates that the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility was used incorrectly or that a
down-level volume is being used.
System action: DB2 startup processing is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Use the print log map (DSNJU004) and change log inventory (DSNJU003) utilities to
make the BSDS consistent with the log data sets.
DSNJ103I csect-name LOG ALLOCATION ERROR DSNAME=dataset-name, ERROR STATUS=status-indicator, SMS REASON CODE=ssssssss
Explanation: The log manager encountered an error while it attempted to allocate the specified active or archive log
data set.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
dataset-name
The name of the data set.
status-indicator
The error reason code that is returned by MVS dynamic allocation (SVC99). This value consists of a 2-byte
error code (S99ERROR) followed by a 2-byte information code (S99INFO) from the SVC99 request block.
ssssssss If available, more SMS reason code information from S99ERSN, which is a field of S99RBX. ssssssss is
displayed if the S99ERROR code indicates an SMS allocation error (97xx).
This message might be preceded by message DSNJ073I.
System action: For active log data sets, if the error is encountered during log manager initialization, DB2 startup is
terminated. If two copies of the active log data sets are defined, this message is displayed only once.
For archive log data sets, if two copies of the archive log data sets are defined, processing continues on the remaining
archive log data set.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If the status-indicator value is '17080000', the site might have one or more active log
data sets defined in the BSDS, but not allocated on DASD. To correct the situation, print the contents of the current
active log data set inventory by using the print log map (DSNJU004) utility. Then, take one of the following actions:
v For each active log data set that is listed in the BSDS, but not allocated on DASD, allocate the active log data set
by using access method services. The access method services command syntax for active log data sets can be found
in installation job DSNTIJIN.
v Use the DSNJU003 utility DELETE statement to delete the errant active log data set name. Then, use the DSNJU003
utility NEWLOG statement to add the correct name to the active log data set inventory. The name that is specified
on the NEWLOG statement must be the same as the name of the actual DB2 active log data set that is allocated on
DASD.
If the problem occurred during DB2 initialization and that data set is an active log data set, take one of the following
actions:
v Resolve the error (status-indicator) that is associated with the active log data set
v Provide another copy of the active log data set by using access method services (AMS)
v Update the BSDS by using the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility
v Restart DB2
For archive log data sets, take one of the following actions:
v If the problem occurred during allocation with the intent to write the data set, no immediate action is required.
However, failure to resolve the error (status-indicator) might eventually cause the available space in the active log to
be exhausted (DSNJ111E), because all future offloads might fail due to the same error.
v If the problem occurred during allocation with the intent to read the data set, determine the problem. Use the DSNJU003 utility DELETE statement to delete the archive log data set from the BSDS archive log inventory. Then, use the DSNJU003 utility NEWLOG statement to add the data set back to the archive log inventory with the correct volume and device.

DSNJ104I csect-name RECEIVED ERROR STATUS nnn FROM macro-name FOR DSNAME dsname
Explanation: DB2 encountered an error while issuing macro 'macro-name'. Error status is the return code from the
specified macro.
v For an OPEN of a VSAM data set, the return code in the error field of the access method services control block is
included in this message as the error status value. Refer to the appropriate VSAM publication for a definition of
these values.
v If the OPEN was for a non-VSAM data set, the error status is zero.
v For MMSRV errors, error status contains the error information returned by media manager services. If an MMSRV
CATUPDT failure occurs attempting to truncate an active log data set, the log data set will be unavailable to DB2
and the status of the log data set will be flagged as 'STOPPED' in the BSDS.
v For VSAM OPEN and MMSRV errors, this message is preceded by an IEC161I message that defines the error that
occurred.
v For a PROTECT of an archive log data set, the return code is from DADSM PROTECT. Refer to the appropriate
MVS publication for a description of the MMSRV return codes.
v For a CLOSE of an archive log data set, the return code is the TCB completion code for an abend received during
CLOSE processing. This abend is normally preceded by an IEC210I or IEC212I message that defines the error.
v For EDTINFO and UCBLOOK errors, the first 2 bytes contain the return code and the second 2 bytes contain the
reason code.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference. for information
about recovery from log failures.
System action: If this condition is encountered during log manager initialization, DB2 startup is terminated. If the
error occurs later and the data set is needed either for offload or for input operations, DB2 processing continues. If a
second copy of the data is available, DB2 attempts to allocate and open the second data set.
If the data set is needed as an active log data set, the log manager attempts to retry the failing request. If the retry
fails, the DB2 subsystem is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If the error occurred during initialization, the installation must either correct the
problem so that the data set is available or provide another copy of the data set and change the BSDSs to point to the
new data set.
If the error occurred during DB2 processing, the return code should be reviewed and the appropriate action taken to
correct the problem so that the data set can be used at a later time or the data set entry can be removed from the
BSDS via the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility.
If the error was received from PROTECT, there may be a problem with the PASSWORD data set. You should refer to
the appropriate DADSM publication to determine the cause of the problem. When the problem has been corrected,
you should ensure the archive log data sets receiving the error are added to the PASSWORD data set. If these archive
log data sets are not added to the PASSWORD data set, archive read will fail when attempting to OPEN these data
sets.
If the error was received from EDTINFO or UCBLOOK and the allocation for the archive log data set fails, verify that
the archive UNIT names are correct in ZPARMs.
DSNJ105I csect-name LOG WRITE ERROR DSNAME=dataset-name LOGRBA=rba-value, ERROR STATUS=ccccffss
Explanation: The log manager encountered a write error in the specified active log data set.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
If csect-name is DSNJW107, the error occurred when writing the log buffers to an active log data set.
If csect-name is DSNWJ207, the error occurred while preformatting the next control area before writing log
data to it.
dataset-name
The name of the data set.
rba-value
The RBA value in the log where the write error occurred.
ccccffss The error information that is returned by media manager.
cccc A 2-byte return code that describes the error.
ff A 1-byte code that defines the functional routine that detected the error.
ss The 1-byte status code that defines a general category of error.
System action: If the dual active logging option is selected, the log manager switches to the next data set for this
copy. If the next data set is not ready, the log manager temporarily enters single logging mode and allocates a
replacement data set for the one that encountered the error. Dual logging is resumed as soon as possible.
If single active logging option is selected and the next data set is not ready, the log manager waits for that data set to
be available. In this case, log writing is inhibited until the replacement is ready for output.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: See the information for the media manager return code that is indicated in ccccffss.
Related reference:
Media Manager return codes
DSNJ106I LOG READ ERROR DSNAME=dsname-value, LOGRBA=log-rba-value, ERROR STATUS=ccccffss
Explanation: The log manager encountered an error while reading an active log data set. The ERROR STATUS value
contains the error information returned by the media manager in the form ccccffss, where ccccis a 2-byte return code
that describes the error, ff is a 1-byte code that defines the functional routine that detected the error, and ss is the
1-byte status code that defines a general category of error.
System action: If another log data set contains the data, the log manager attempts to read the data from the
alternate source. If an alternate source is not available, the log manager returns a read error return code to the
program requesting the log data.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If the site is using dual logging, the requested RBA was probably retrieved from the
corresponding dual active log data set, and no immediate response is necessary. However, if this error occurs
frequently, or if the site is using single logging, immediate attention may be required.
Take corrective action based on the media manager return codes.
It might be necessary to replace the bad data set with a new data set containing the log data, and to update the
BSDSs to reflect the new data set using the change log inventory (DSNJU003) NEWLOG operation.
This message can also be issued as the result of a possible user error. If the data set name associated with the
DSNAME value is missing, and the ERROR STATUS value contains '00180408' or '00100408', then the site is using
dual logging, but only one set of active log data sets are defined in the BSDS. To resolve this condition, take one of
the following actions:
v Define a second set of active log data sets using access method services (if they are not defined already), and
update the BSDS log inventory using the DSNJU003 NEWLOG operation.
v To specify single logging, set the value of the TWOACTV subsystem parameter to NO.

DSNJ107I READ ERROR ON BSDS DSNAME=name ERROR STATUS=status
Explanation: The log manager encountered an error while reading the specified bootstrap data set. Error Status
contains the VSAM return and feedback codes. It is a 2-byte field with the first byte containing the hexadecimal
return code and the second containing the hexadecimal feedback code. Refer to the appropriate MVS publication for
a description of VSAM return and reason codes.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference. for information
about recovery from BSDS or log failures.
System action: If dual BSDSs are available, the log manager attempts to read from the other BSDS. If read from the
second BSDS fails or if there is only one BSDS, an error code is returned to the log request that caused access to the
BSDS.
If read error is detected during start-up, DB2 initialization process is terminated to prevent users from operating in a
cripple mode. User should take action to correct the problem.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: It may be necessary to replace or repair the BSDS, depending on what conditions
resulted from the read error. To replace a BSDS, first delete the bad BSDS, and then define the new BSDS with the
same name and attributes. If a new name is used for the new BSDS, change the log startup JCL to specify the new
BSDS name.
DSNJ108I WRITE ERROR ON BSDS DSNAME=... ERROR STATUS=...
Explanation: The log manager encountered an error while writing to the specified bootstrap data set. Error Status
contains the VSAM return and feedback codes. It is a 2-byte field with the first containing the hexadecimal return
code and the second containing the hexadecimal feedback code. Refer to the appropriate VSAM publication for a
description of VSAM return and reason codes.
System action: If dual BSDSs are available, the log manager enters single BSDS mode using the remaining good
BSDS. Otherwise, an error code is returned to the log request that caused access to the BSDS.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If dual BSDS mode is being used, execute an offline access method services job to
rename the error BSDS and define a new BSDS with the same name. Then enter the log manager -RECOVER BSDS
command to reestablish dual BSDS mode.
If dual BSDS mode is not being used, the DB2 subsystem must be shut down, and the BSDS must be recovered from
a backup copy. To recover the BSDS, use the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility.
DSNJ109I OUT OF SPACE IN BSDS DSNAME=...
Explanation: The specified bootstrap data set does not have any more space. The operation that encountered the
out-of-space condition did not complete properly.
System action: If dual BSDSs are available, the log manager enters single BSDS mode using the remaining good
BSDS. Otherwise, an error code is returned to the log request that caused access to the BSDS.
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If dual BSDS mode is being used, execute an offline access method services job to
rename the full BSDS and define a new, larger BSDS with the same name. Enter the DB2 -RECOVER BSDS command
to reestablish dual BSDS mode.
If dual BSDS mode is not being used, the DB2 subsystem must be shut down and the BSDS recovered offline. In this
case, execute the same access method services job mentioned above to rename the full data set and define a larger
data set. Next, execute an access method services REPRO job to copy the full BSDS into the new BSDS.
DSNJ110E LAST COPYn ACTIVE LOG DATA SET IS nnn PERCENT FULL
Explanation: This message is issued when the last available active log data set is 5% full, and is reissued after each
additional 5% of the data set space is filled.
System action: Each time the message is issued, the offload processing is retried. If the situation is not corrected, the
active log data space fills to capacity, message DSNJ111E is issued, and the DB2 online processing halts.
Operator response: To clear this condition, steps must be taken to complete other waiting offload tasks. Once an
active log data set is made available (reusable) by completing the offload process for it, the DB2 logging activity can
continue.
Execute an MVS Display System Requests command (D R,L for example) to determine the outstanding requests related
to the log offload process. Take the necessary action to satisfy any requests, and permit offload to continue. If offload
fails to complete normally or cannot be initiated, notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Either correct the problem that is causing the offload process to fail, or add more
active log data sets. The latter action requires DB2 to be down and the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility to be
run.
Possible causes for the shortage of active log data space are:
v Excessive logging. For example, too many users have requested logs at the same time or too many utilities have
specified LOG(YES).
v Delayed or slow offloading. For example, failure to mount archive volumes, incorrect replies to offload messages,
or slow device speeds.
v Excessive use of the -ARCHIVE LOG command. Each invocation of the -ARCHIVE LOG command causes the DB2
subsystem to switch to a new active log data set and to initiate an offload of the active log. Although the
-ARCHIVE LOG command will not be processed when only one active log data set remains in a copy of the active
log (see DSNJ319I), excessive use of the command could have consumed all space in the active log except the
current active log data sets.
v Offloads failed. See Operator Response.
v Insufficient active log space. See Operator Response.
v Offload task no longer functioning. Issue the -ARCHIVE LOG CANCEL OFFLOAD command to abnormally
terminate and restart the offload process.
DSNJ111E OUT OF SPACE IN ACTIVE LOG DATA SETS
Explanation: Due to delays in offload processing, all available space in all active log data sets has been exhausted.
DB2 recovery logging cannot continue.
System action: The DB2 log manager waits for an available data set.
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
Operator response: Execute an MVS Display System Requests command (D R,L for example) to ensure that there
are no outstanding requests that are related to the log offload process. Take the necessary action to satisfy any
requests, and permit offload to continue.
System programmer response: Examine the JES job log for the ssnmMSTR address space to determine the cause of
the delay. If the delay was caused by the lack of a resource required for offload, the necessary resource must be made
available to allow offload to complete and thus permit logging to proceed.

DSNJ112E csect-name INSUFFICIENT ACTIVE LOG DATA SETS DEFINED IN BSDS
Explanation: There are not enough active log data sets defined in the BSDS to start DB2. This condition usually
exists for one of the following reasons.
v Fewer than two data sets are defined for one of the active log copy sets.
v DSN6LOGP specified TWOACTV=YES in DB2 initialization parameters, but data sets for two copies of active log
are not defined in BSDS.
v Fewer than two data sets are available (not flagged as STOPPED) for one of the active log copy sets.
System action: DB2 startup is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Use the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility to make the number of active log
data sets defined in the BSDS consistent with the parameters specified on DSN6LOGP. Log data sets that are flagged
as 'STOPPED' will not be reused by DB2. These data sets must be recovered (either redefined or recovered from the
other copy of the log) and the log data sets must be deleted and re-added to the BSDS (using DSNJU003) with the
appropriate RBA's, to clear the STOPPED status. Restart DB2.
DSNJ113E csect-name log-type log-value NOT IN ANY ACTIVE OR ARCHIVE LOG DATA SET.  CONNECTION-ID=aaaaaaaa, CORRELATION-ID=aaaaaaaa, MEMBER-ID=member-id
Explanation: A request was made to read the log starting at this log-value and log-type (RBA or LRSN). However, the
log value cannot be found in any active or archive log data set for the indicated member. The member-id contains the
ID of the data sharing member whose logs were being requested at the time of the failure or zero if data sharing is
not active. The connection and correlation IDs identify the user or application that encountered the problem.
Correlation IDs beginning with '0nn' where 'nn' is a number from 01 to 28, identify system agents. If you suspect an
error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem,
see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference. for information about recovery from
log failures.
System action: Depending upon what log record is being read and why, this error could result in an abend with a
reason code of '00D1032A'.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: This error could be a user error. In most cases, the archive log data set that
contained the requested log value has been deleted from the bootstrap data set (BSDS) by the change log inventory
(DSNJU003) utility. Complete the following steps to correct the error:
v Locate the output from an old print log map run of the BSDS for the DB2 member identified by member-id.
v Identify the data set that contains the missing log value. If the data set has not been reused, run the DSNJU003
utility to add this data set back into the inventory of log data sets.
v Restart DB2.
DSNJ114I ERROR ON ARCHIVE DATA SET, OFFLOAD CONTINUING WITH ONLY ONE ARCHIVE DATA SET BEING GENERATED
Explanation: An error occurred while accessing one of the archive data sets being created by offload. Because the
dual archive option is specified, offload is continuing with the other archive data set. For the RBA range being
offloaded, there is only one copy of the archive data set instead of the usual two copies.
System action: Offload produces a single archive data set.
System programmer response: A second copy of this archive log data set can be made, and the BSDS can be
updated with the change log inventory utility (DSNJU003).
DSNJ115I OFFLOAD FAILED, COULD NOT ALLOCATE AN ARCHIVE DATA SET
Explanation: Offload could not allocate or open an archive log data set. The offload was not performed. If this
message is preceded by message DSNJ103I, the offload data set could not be allocated. If this message is not
preceded by DSNJ103I, the offload data set was successfully allocated, but could not be opened.
System action: Offload will be tried at a later time.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If the allocation failed with DSNJ103I, review the error status information of
message DSNJ103I. Correct the condition that caused the data set allocation to fail so that, on retry, the offload can
take place.
DSNJ116I ERROR ATTEMPTING TO ADD ARCHIVE ENTRY TO BSDS
Explanation: Offload could not add an archive entry to the BSDS. The offload is considered incomplete. The active
log data set is not marked as reusable for new log data. This message is preceded by message DSNJ107I, DSNJ108I,
or DSNJ109I.
System action: Offload will be retried at a later time.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Refer to the specific preceding message for action.
DSNJ117I INITIALIZATION ERROR READING BSDS DSNAME=......, ERROR STATUS=...
Explanation: The log manager encountered an error during initialization reading from the specified bootstrap data
set. Error status contains the VSAM return and feedback codes. It is a two byte field with the first containing the
hexadecimal return code and the second byte containing the hexadecimal feedback code. Refer to the appropriate
VSAM publication for a description of VSAM return and reason codes.
System action: DB2 startup is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Determine the cause of the read error using the VSAM error status information
provided. Restart DB2.
DSNJ118I LOG INITIALIZATION RECEIVED RETURN CODE nnn FROM xxxxxxxx MACRO
Explanation: Log manager initialization received a bad return code from the named macro.
System action: DB2 initialization is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Determine the problem from the documentation on the named macro and return
code. Then take appropriate steps, and restart the DB2 subsystem.
DSNJ119I BOOTSTRAP ACCESS INITIALIZATION PROCESSING FAILED
Explanation: During log manager initialization, the bootstrap data set access function was unable to complete its
initialization process. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about
identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
for information about recovery from BSDS or log failures.
System action: DB2 startup is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: One or more error messages describing the specific error have preceded this
message. Refer to the specific message(s) for error analysis and the appropriate action to take.
DSNJ120I DUAL BSDS DATA SETS HAVE UNEQUAL TIMESTAMPS, BSDS1 SYSTEM=timestamp, UTILITY=timestamp, BSDS2 SYSTEM=timestamp, UTILITY=timestamp
Explanation: When the log manager was initialized, the timestamps of the dual bootstrap data sets (BSDS) did not
agree. The timestamps from the system and from the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility are shown for each
BSDS. The timestamps have the format yy.ddd hh:mm:ss.th:
yy Two-digit indicator for the year.
ddd Three-digit indicator for the day of the year.
hh:mm:ss.th
Indicator for the time of the day.
System action: DB2 attempts to re-synchronize the BSDS data sets to restore dual BSDS mode. If re-synchronization
is successful, DB2 restart continues.
Operator response: If restart fails, notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If restart fails, run the print log map (DSNJU004) utility against each BSDS. From the
output, determine which data set is obsolete, delete it, define a replacement for it, and copy the remaining BSDS to
the replacement.
If output from the print log map (DSNJU004) utility for both data sets is similar, delete the data set with the oldest
timestamp, and copy the data set with the most recent timestamp.

DSNJ121I LOG MANAGER ENCOUNTERED AN ERROR READING THE JFCB. DDNAME=nnnnnnnn
Explanation: During log manager initialization (if dual BSDS data sets are specified), the job file control block
(JFCB) in MVS is read to obtain the data set names associated with DDNAME BSDS1 and BSDS2. This error is
caused by a missing DD statement.
System action: DB2 is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Ensure that a DD statement exists in the DB2 startup procedure for DDNAME
BSDS1. If dual BSDS data sets are used, ensure that a DD statement also exists in the DB2 startup procedure for
DDNAME BSDS2.
DSNJ122I DUAL BSDS DATA SETS ARE OUT OF SYNCHRONIZATION
Explanation: During log manager initialization, the dual BSDS data sets were found to differ in content in one of
the following ways:
v A record that exists in both BSDSs is not identical. (This comparison accounts for some minor differences.)
v A record exists in one BSDS and not in the other.
v A required record is missing from one BSDS copy.
The print log map (DSNJU004) utility does not print all of the information in the BSDS. Therefore, the output from DSNJU004 might be identical for two BSDSs, but the BSDSs might still be different.
Example scenarios that might cause this problem include the following situations:
v The change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility was used to alter one copy of a BSDS and not the other.
v DB2 was forced into single-BSDS mode due to an I/O error, and the stopped BSDS copy was not recovered.
System action: DB2 startup is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Run DSNJU004 against each BSDS to determine which is more current. Delete the
outdated copy, define a replacement for the deleted data set, and copy the remaining BSDS to the replacement by
using IDCAMS REPRO.

DSNJ123I CHANGE LOG INVENTORY FAILURE DETECTED
Explanation: During log manager initialization, the BSDS data set was found to have been incompletely processed
by the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility.
System action: DB2 startup is terminated.
System programmer response: Run the print log map (DSNJU004) utility to determine what operation against the
BSDS did not complete. Run the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility against the BSDS(s) to allow any
unfinished processing to be completed.
DSNJ124I OFFLOAD OF ACTIVE LOG SUSPENDED FROM RBA xxxxxx TO RBA xxxxxx DUE TO I/O ERROR
Explanation: During offload, an unrecoverable I/O error was encountered on an active log data set. The data set
experiencing the error is marked unusable, and no further logging is done to that data set.
System action: Active log data sets continue to be offloaded as they become full.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer to initiate recovery actions.
System programmer response: Complete the following steps:
1. Recover the data manually from the data set.
2. Copy it to an archive data set.
3. Run the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility to make the new archive data set available to the DB2
subsystem.
4. Remove the error-prone active log data set from DB2 by using the change log inventory utility.
DSNJ125I ERROR DUMPING BSDS, OFFLOAD CONTINUING WITHOUT PRODUCING THE BSDS DUMP
Explanation: An error occurred while dumping the bootstrap data set (BSDS) during the offload process. The data
set is not produced, but the offload process continues. The volume containing the offloaded data set does not contain
a BSDS for recovery use.
System action: The system continues the offload process without producing a dump of the bootstrap data set.
DSNJ126I BSDS ERROR FORCED SINGLE BSDS MODE
Explanation: The log manager encountered an I/O error or a VSAM logical error on a bootstrap data set. This
message is preceded by message DSNJ107I or DSNJ108I.
System action: The log manager enters single BSDS mode using the remaining BSDS.
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Execute an offline access method services job to rename the error BSDS and define a
new BSDS with the same name. Then enter the log manager -RECOVER BSDS command to reestablish dual BSDS
mode.
DSNJ127I SYSTEM TIMESTAMP FOR BSDS=timestamp
Explanation: When the log manager is initialized, the system timestamp for the bootstrap data sets (BSDS) is
displayed. The timestamp has the format yy.ddd hh:mm:ss.th:
yy Two-digit indicator for the year.
ddd Three-digit indicator for the day of the year.
hh:mm:ss.th
Indicator for the time of the day.
This time stamp should be close to the last time at which this subsystem was stopped. If it not, then it might indicate
that a restart is being attempted with the wrong BSDS.
System action: DB2 startup continues.
Operator response: If the time displayed is not close to the time when this subsystem was last stopped, contact the
system programmer.
System programmer response: If you cannot explain the apparent time discrepancy, cancel the subsystem. From the
startup procedure for the subsystem services address space, determine the data set names of the bootstrap data sets
and run the print log map (DSNJU004) utility. Check whether the active and archive log data sets all belong to this
subsystem. If not, then change the startup procedure for the subsystem services address space to use the correct
bootstrap data sets.

 DSNJU004 (print log map) (DB2 Utilities)
DSNJ128I LOG OFFLOAD TASK FAILED FOR ACTIVE LOG nnnnn
Explanation: The offload task abended while attempting to offload the relative byte address (RBA) range in active
log data set 'nnnnn'.
System action: The offload task terminates and the archive data sets allocated to the offload task are deallocated
and deleted. The status of the active log data sets involved in the failed offload processing remains set to 'not
reusable'.
The log offload task will be re-initiated by one of several events. The most common are:
v All the available space in the current active log data set has been used (normal case).
v A DSNJ110E message is issued.
v The master address space is started, but data in the active log has not been archived.
v An I/O error occurs on the active log, which will force the system to truncate and offload the active log data set,
and switch to a new active log data set.
Operator response: This message is the result of an offload failure, and will be preceded by one or more DB2
messages (for example, DSNJ073I) and/or MVS ABEND messages (for example, IEC030I, IEC031I, IEC032I). If DB2 is
operating with restricted active log resources (see message DSNJ110E), quiesce the system to restrict logging activity
until the ABEND or the DSNJ110E condition can be resolved. Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: This message is the result of an offload failure, and will be preceded by one or more
DB2 messages (for example, DSNJ073I) and/or MVS ABEND messages (for example, IEC030I, IEC031I IEC032I).
Investigate and correct the cause of the ABEND before the offload is attempted again by DB2.
Problem determination: This message is the result of an offload ABEND and will be preceded by one or more DB2
messages and/or MVS ABEND messages. See the documentation for the associated DB2 and/or MVS messages to
formulate a course of corrective action. Use the print log map (DSNJU004) utility to print the BSDS (both copies if
running in dual mode), and then use the DSNJU004 output to determine the current status of the active and archive
log data sets.
This message can be generated for a variety of reasons. However, the most likely are:
v Archive log data set allocation errors. Refer to the text for message DSNJ103I for corrective action.
v The size of the archive log data set is too small to contain the active log data set(s) during offload processing. All
secondary space allocations have been used. This condition is normally accompanied by MVS ABEND message
IEC030I.
v All available space on the DASD volume(s) to which the archive data set is being written has been exhausted. This
condition is normally accompanied by MVS ABEND message IEC032I.
v The primary space allocation for the archive log data set (as specified in ZPARMs) is too large to allocate to any
available online DASD device. This condition is normally accompanied by MVS ABEND message IEC032I.
DSNJ129I END OF log-rba eol-rba X COULD NOT BE FOUND IN ANY ACTIVE LOG DATA SET HIGHEST RBA FOUND WAS hi-rba X
Explanation: The log manager has been requested to find 'eol-rba', the log record which has been recorded in the
bootstrap data set (BSDS) as the highest RBA written. This RBA cannot be found in any active log data set. The
highest RBA which could be found in any active data set was 'hi-rba'.
System action: DB2 startup processing is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Most likely, the active log data set containing the requested RBA has been deleted
from the BSDS by the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility. If the data set has not been reused, run DSNJU003 to
add this data set back into the BSDS. Restart DB2.
If the data set is not available, a conditional restart must be performed to either truncate the log prior to the RBA
value of the missing data set, or to cold start at a higher RBA value. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need
to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting
data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference. for more information.
DSNJ130I ICF CATALOG NAME IN BSDS DOES NOT AGREE WITH DSNZPARM. BSDS CATALOG NAME=name, DSNZPARM CATALOG NAME=name
Explanation: The ICF catalog name defined in DSNZPARM does not agree with the name contained in the
bootstrap data set (BSDS).
System action: DB2 startup is abended.
Operator response: If you attempt to start the DB2 subsystem, you will receive this same message and abnormal
termination will result until the problem is resolved.
System programmer response: Change the ICF catalog name in the BSDS to agree with the name defined in
DSNZPARM during DB2 initialization. To change the ICF catalog name in the BSDS, use the BSDS change log
inventory (DSNJU003) utility with the NEWCAT control statement.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: During log manager initialization, the ICF catalog name defined in DSNZPARM is
compared to the catalog name in the BSDS to ensure that the catalog name used by the log manager during DB2
processing is correct. These names were found not to be the same.
DSNJ131I csect-name DUAL BSDS MODE RESTORED FROM BSDSn
Explanation: Dual BSDS mode has been restored using BSDS copy n. This copy is the BSDS data set with the most
recent system timestamp.
System action: DB2 startup continues.
DSNJ132I csect-name ARCHIVE LOG READ ERROR DSNAME=data-set-name, diag-information
Explanation: An I/O error occurred attempting to read from archive log data set data-set-name. The value for
diag-information contains a portion of the message text generated by the SYNADAF macro to describe the error. The
generated message text contains information such as jobname, stepname, unit address, device type, ddname,
operation attempted, and error description.
System action: DB2 will attempt the read request on a secondary copy of the archive log, if it is available. If a
secondary copy of the archive does not exist, or this error occurs on the secondary copy of the archive log, the log
read request fails with reason code 00D10329.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If the archive log read request is satisfied by a secondary archive log data set, no
immediate response is required. Otherwise, attempt to determine the cause of the I/O error and recover the archive
data set as required. For example, if the archive log data set has been reblocked by moving or copying the data set,
or by an HSM recall, it could result in a 'wrong length record' error. Use IEBGENER, or an equivalent program, to
restore the data set with the original DCB information.
DSNJ138I csect-name OFFLOAD COMPLETE FOR LOG TRUNCATION FROM AN ARCHIVE LOG COMMAND, ENDRBA=xxxxxxxxxxxx
Explanation: This message indicates that the offload of the truncated active logs, resulting from an -ARCHIVE LOG
command, has completed successfully. xxxxxxxxxxxx is the ENDRBA of the truncated active logs and the newly
created archive log data sets.
DSNJ139I LOG OFFLOAD TASK ENDED
Explanation: Processing of the active log offload ended.
System action: This message is written to the MVS console.
Operator response: This message does not guarantee that the offload completed without errors. Check the console
log and task messages to review the execution of the offload task to determine whether any abnormal events
occurred during the offload.
DSNJ140I csect-name INVALID BSDS RELEASE LEVEL ACTIVE=xxxxxx ARCHIVE=yyyyyy DSN=zzzzzz
Explanation: At initialization time DB2 detected that the BSDS log records are not at the proper release level for this
release of DB2. 'xxxxxx' contains the release level for the ACTIVE log records and 'yyyyyy' contains the release level
for the ARCHIVE log records. 'zzzzzz' contains the data set name for the BSDS encountering the error.
System action: DB2 startup will be terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer so operating procedures can be changed.
System programmer response: Run the appropriate conversion program (DSNJMIG0 or DSNJFAL0) to convert the
BSDS data set to a compatible release level.
DSNJ150E LOG CAPTURE EXIT ABEND, EXIT DEACTIVATED
Explanation: An abnormal program interrupt was detected while executing in the installation-supplied log capture
exit code (i.e. entry point DSNJW117 in load module DSNJL004). As a result of the abend, the log capture exit will no
longer be active; log data will no longer be available for Exit capture/processing.
This message can only occur when an installation-supplied log capture exit (entry DSNJW117) is active for this
instance of DB2.
System action: The log capture exit (entry point DSNJW117) is terminated. No further calls will be attempted for
this DB2 instance. A full dump is provided for diagnostic purposes.
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Determine the cause of the DSNJL004 load module (DSNJW117 entry point) abend
and take corrective action.
Attention: A correctly-functioning copy of load module DSNJL004/entry DSNJW117 must be available in order to
start DB2. If the problem which caused the above abend cannot be corrected, ensure that the default DSNJW117 entry
(load module DSNJL004 - supplied with the DB2 release) is available during the next DB2 subsystem start.
User response: See System Programmer Response below.
DSNJ151I csect-name IN READING log-type log-value, A NONZERO REASON CODE WAS RETURNED.  CONNECTION-ID=connection-id, CORRELATION-ID=correlation-id, REASON-CODE=reason-code, MEMBER-ID=member-id
Explanation: DB2 could not successfully complete the read of this log-value and log-type (RBA or LRSN) due to
reason code 'ccc'. The member-id contains the ID of the data sharing member whose logs were being requested at the
time of the failure or zero if data sharing is not active. The user or application that encountered the error is identified
by the connection and correlation ID. Messages that have the same connection ID and correlation ID relate to the
same application. Correlation IDs beginning with '0nn', where nn is a number from 01 to 28, identify system agents.
System action: DB2 attempts to recover from the error.
System programmer response: If DB2 was able to recover from the error and successfully complete the application,
no further action is required. If the application abnormally terminated or DB2 could not recover successfully, this
message is followed by one or more messages. Refer to the information in this message and the subsequent messages
to determine the appropriate corrective action.

DSNJ152I csect-name ERROR ENCOUNTERED WHEN ATTEMPTING TO BUILD ARCHIVE LOG VOLUME LIST. CONNECTION-ID=collection-id, CORRELATION-ID=correlation-id, REASON-CODE=reason-code
Explanation: An error occurred while attempting to create the Archive Log Volumes report. An RBA range could
not be successfully mapped into one or more archive data sets due to reason code 'ccc'. The user or application that
encountered the error is identified by the connection and correlation ID. This message might be preceded by one or
more related error messages. Messages that have the same connection ID and correlation ID relate to the same user.
Correlation IDs beginning with '0nn', where 'nn' is a number from 01 to 28, identify system agents.
This failure could be caused by one or more missing archive log data sets, or a system error (for example, an I/O
error reading BSDS).
The Archive Log Volumes report (see message DSNJ330I) is not produced. In addition, no premounting of tapes is
possible.
System action: The user or application continues execution. The physical read process for the user or application
continues until the job completes normally or terminates abnormally. The job can terminate abnormally if the error is
encountered again when the data set is physically required for the read process.
System programmer response: If the user or application completes successfully, no further action is necessary. If the
user or application does not complete successfully, refer to the messages related to the actual failure to determine the
appropriate corrective actions.

DSNJ153E csect-name CRITICAL LOG READ ERROR CONNECTION-ID = connection-id CORRELATION-ID = correlation-id LUWID = logical-unit-of-work-id=token REASON-CODE = reason-code
Explanation: While processing a DB2 must-complete function, DB2 encountered an error during an attempt to
access the required log data sets.
CONNECTION-ID, CORRELATION-ID, and LUWID together identify the thread associated with the request. token is
a unique token number associated with the LUWID. reason-code identifies the most recent log-read failure.
System action: The DSNJ154I message requests to retry the log-read request, and immediately follows this error
message. DB2 will wait for a reply to message DSNJ154I before retrying the failed log-read request, or before
abending.
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
System programmer response: Review the description of the reason-code associated with the log-read failure.
Examine the system console log for additional messages regarding the log- read error. Correct the cause of the error,
if possible, and reply 'Y' to the DSNJ154I message in order to retry the log-read request. If it is not possible to correct
the problem causing the log-read errors, and the failing log read request is the result of a thread rollback or
-RECOVER POSTPONED command, consider canceling the log read request with the -CANCEL THREAD
NOBACKOUT or -RECOVER POSTPONED CANCEL command. See the DB2 Command Reference for details about
these commands. If canceling the log read request is not an option, quiesce the work on the DB2 system before
replying 'N' to the DSNJ154I message in preparation for DB2 termination.
DSNJ154I csect-name REPLY Y TO RETRY LOG READ REQUEST, N TO ABEND
Explanation: While processing a DB2 must-complete function, DB2 encountered an error during an attempt to
access the required log data sets.
System action: The DSNJ153E message identifies the critical log-read error, and immediately precedes this message.
DB2 will wait for the operator's reply to proceed with the log-read request.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer. When actions have been taken to correct the cause of the
log-read errors, reply 'Y' to request a retry of the failing log-read request. A reply of 'N' will fail the log-read request
and the task will abend. DB2 then terminates.
System programmer response: Review the description of the reason-code associated with the log-read failure, and
examine the system console log for additional messages regarding the log-read error. Correct the cause of the error, if
possible, and reply 'Y' to the DSNJ154I message to retry the log-read request. If it is not possible to correct the
problem causing the log-read errors, quiesce the work on the DB2 system before replying 'N' to the DSNJ154I
message in preparation for DB2 termination.
DSNJ156I INVALID BSDS CONVERSION, DSN=dataset-name
Explanation: During initialization time, DB2 detected an invalid BSDS. An invalid BSDS can result from a failure
during a prior attempt to run a conversion program.
dataset-name
The data set name for the BSDS encountering the error.
System action: DB2 startup terminates.
System programmer response: The procedure for running the conversion program includes making a copy of the
BSDS before conversion. Restore the BSDS to the original pre-conversion copy, and try the conversion again. After the
conversion is successful, restart DB2.

DSNJ208E csect name MEMBER member name WAS NOT FOUND IN THE BSDS SPECIFIED IN THE GROUP DD STATEMENT.
Explanation: You are running the print log map (DSNJU004) utility. No member record exists for this member in the
bootstrap data set (BSDS) specified in the GROUP DD statement.
System action: The log map for this member is not printed. If the records for other members are requested and are
found in the BSDS specified in the GROUP DD statement, they are printed.
User response: Use the DISPLAY GROUP command to verify that the member name is a valid name and that the
member has successfully joined the group. Also verify that the BSDS specified in the GROUP DD statement is
correct. If the member name and the BSDS name are correct, then the most likely causes of this message are:
v The 'missing member' never joined the group because it was never started.
v The member whose BSDS you specified in the GROUP DD statement was down when the missing member joined
the group and has not been restarted.
To gather the information from the missing member, you can rerun the utility, using the BSDS DDNAME option to
point to the missing member's BSDS. To avoid this problem in the future, make sure the BSDS named in the GROUP
statement is from a recently started member.
DSNJ209I ENDRBA VALUE MUST BE GREATER THAN STARTRBA VALUE
Explanation: The 'STARTRBA' and 'ENDRBA' parameters specify an RBA range. Hence, the ENDRBA value must be

DSNJ214I SPECIFIED DSNAME ALREADY EXISTS IN BSDS, DDNAME=xxxxxxxx
Explanation: The user attempted a NEWLOG operation with a data set name that already exists in the BSDS. An
entry is never made in a BSDS if the specified DSNAME currently exists in either the active or archive records of that
BSDS. 'xxxxxxxx' contains the ddname of the subject BSDS.
System action: The current utility is terminated. This message is written to the SYSPRINT data set, not to a console.
User response: Either correct the control statement and rerun the utility, or delete the existing DSNAME from the
BSDS and rerun the utility.
DSNJ215I csect-name SVC 99 INFORMATION REQUEST FOR DD NAME 'ddname' FAILED. RC= rc, RSN= rsncd, AND INFO CODE infocode.
Explanation: The DSNJU004 (print log map) utility requested information from the z/OS Dynamic Allocation
facility about the indicated DD name, but the system was unable to provide the information.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
ddname The DD name.
rc The return code from the z/OS DYNALLOC (SVC 99) service.
rsncd The reason code from the z/OS DYNALLOC (SVC 99) service.
infocode The information code from the z/OS DYNALLOC (SVC 99) service.
System action: If the information request was for the SYSIN DD statement, DSNJU004 assumes that the control
statement was not provided. DSNJU004 attempts to continue the request by using the SYSUT1 DD statement to
locate the BSDS to be mapped.
If the information request was for the DD name of a BSDS, the attempts to get information about BSDS data sets are
stopped. If information about any BSDS data sets was previously acquired, the maps of those BSDS data sets are
printed. Otherwise, the utility terminates.
System programmer response: See the reason code for DYNALLOC to determine the action to take.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v SYSABEND, SYSUDUMP, or SYSMDUMP output.
v SYSPRINT output, including JCL, for the application program or batch job, and system messages that were issued.
Make sure that MSGLEVEL=(1,1) on the JOB statement so that all diagnostic information is sent to SYSPRINT.

User response: Correct the control statement, and rerun the utility.
DSNJ218I SPECIFIED VOLUME DOES NOT EXIST IN BSDS, DDNAME=xxxxxxxx
Explanation: The DELETE operation specifies a COPY1VOL or COPY2VOL argument that cannot be found in the
BSDS. 'xxxxxxxx' contains the ddname of the subject BSDS.
System action: The current utility is terminated. This message is written to the SYSPRINT data set, not to a console.
User response: Correct the control statement, and rerun the utility.
DSNJ219I csect-name OPEN ERROR, DDNAME=xxxxxxxx
Explanation: An error occurred when the CSECT 'csect-name' tried to open a data set named 'xxxxxxxx'.
This error can be caused by a number of different conditions. The most probable conditions are:
1. The ddname of the SYSPRINT, SYSIN, or SYSUT1 data set was not specified in the user's job control language
(JCL).
2. The DB2 subsystem is currently executing.
3. The bootstrap data set (BSDS) was allocated by another job with a disposition (DISP) that conflicts with the DISP
specified in the user's JCL.
4. The data set associated with 'xxxxxxxx' is already open, possibly due to an earlier system abend.
5. The user is not authorized to access the data set associated with 'xxxxxxxx'
6. Insufficient virtual storage is available to perform the OPEN command.
7. The catalog indicates that the data set associated with 'xxxxxxxx' has an invalid physical record size.
System action: The current utility is terminated.
DB2 writes this message to the SYSPRINT data set, not to a console.
User response: The user's action depends on the condition that caused the OPEN error. The following is a list of
appropriate actions corresponding to the conditions listed in the explanation:
1. Provide the missing DD statements, and then rerun the utility.
2. Wait until the DB2 subsystem is inactive before running the utility again because the log utility cannot execute
while the DB2 subsystem is active.
3. Correct the disposition conflict and then rerun the utility.
4. Submit an access method services (IDCAMS) VERIFY job against the data set associated with 'xxxxxxxx'. Rerun
the log utility job.
5. In the case of an authorization failure, a separate message is usually generated from the authorization facility
(RACF, for example). Investigate the authorization messages and obtain the proper authorization before running
the utility again.
6. Insufficient virtual storage is usually accompanied by a separate error from the MVS operating system. Increase
the REGION size on the JCL job step and rerun the utility.
7. Contact the system programmer.

DSNJ220I BSDS IN CREATE MODE. NO DATA TO MAP, DDNAME=nnnnnnnn
Explanation: A utility found the BSDS to be in create mode, meaning it contains no data. nnnnnnnn contains the
ddname of the BSDS data set.
System action: The current utility is terminated. This message is written to the SYSPRINT data set, not to a console.
User response: Ensure that the BSDS data set name specified as input to the utility is correct.
DSNJ221I PREVIOUS ERROR CAUSED xxxxxxxx OPERATION TO BE BYPASSED
Explanation: DB2 encountered errors while processing a utility. These errors subsequently caused 'xxxxxxxx' to be
bypassed.
This message is a warning only and is displayed after messages that specify the error or errors that caused the utility
operation to abend. Note that the error or errors may not be associated with the current 'xxxxxxxx' operation; rather,
under log utility processing, a significant error in any operation causes the control statements for this and any
subsequent operations to be checked for syntax only. BSDS updates do not occur for any operation specified in this
message.
System action: The log utility continues to process. However, for this and all subsequent operations, the bootstrap
data set (BSDS) is not updated and the utility only checks the syntax of the control statements.
DB2 writes this message to the SYSPRINT data set, not to a console.
User response: Consult the previous messages and correct any errors that caused this message to be generated.
Resubmit the log utility job for all operations that have been bypassed.
DSNJ222I INVALID SPECIFICATION OF xxxx PARAMETER ARGUMENT
Explanation: You specified the parameter 'xxxx'. This parameter is not valid for the argument.

User response: Correct the parameter argument on the control statement, and rerun the utility.
DSNJ223I xxxx PARAMETER ARGUMENT EXCEEDS MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE LENGTH
Explanation: The argument value of the parameter named 'xxxx' exceeds the maximum length allowed.
System action: The current utility is terminated. This message is written to the SYSPRINT data set, not to a console.
User response: Correct the parameter argument on the control statement, and rerun the utility.
DSNJ224I xxxx PARAMETER APPEARS TOO OFTEN
Explanation: The parameter named 'xxxx' was specified more than once on the same control statement.
System action: The current utility is terminated. This message is written to the SYSPRINT data set, not to a console.
User response: Remove the redundant parameter, and rerun the utility.
DSNJ225I xxxx OPERATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
Explanation: The change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility operation named 'xxxx' completed successfully.
System action: This message is written to the SYSPRINT data set, not to a console.
DSNJ226I SPECIFIED VOLUME ALREADY EXISTS IN BSDS, DDNAME=xxxxxxx
Explanation: The specified volume currently exists in the archive log records of the BSDS. 'xxxxxxxx' specifies the
ddname of the subject BSDS.
System action: The current utility is terminated. This message is written to the SYSPRINT data set, not to a console.
User response: Either correct the parameter argument on the control statement, or delete the specified volume and
rerun the utility.
DSNJ227I NO SPACE AVAILABLE IN BSDS FOR ADDITIONAL ARCHIVE VOLUME ENTRIES, DDNAME=xxxxxxxx
Explanation: The maximum number of archive volumes has been exceeded, and no more space is available for
volume entries in the copy specified.
System action: The current utility is terminated.
User response: Delete some of the archive entries in the specified copy number, and rerun the utility.
DSNJ228I csect-name LOG DEALLOCATION ERROR DSNAME=dsname, ERROR STATUS=eeeeiiii, SMS REASON CODE=ssssssss
Explanation: The log manager encountered an error while trying to dynamically deallocate the data set. Error status
is the error reason code returned by MVS dynamic allocation.
System action: Log manager processing continues.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: The error status portion of this message contains the 2-byte error code (S99ERROR)
followed by the 2-byte information code (S99INFO) from the SVC request block. If the S99ERROR code indicates an
SMS deallocation error (97XX), then 'ssssssss' contains additional SMS reason code information obtained from
S99ERSN. Refer to the MVS/ESA SPL: Application Development Guide for a description of these codes.
DSNJ229I csect-name OPEN FAILED FOR SYSIN
Explanation: An error occurred when the DB2 Print Log Map utility tried to open the SYSIN data set.
Possible causes are:
1. The DD name of the SYSIN data set was not specified in the user's job control language (JCL).
2. Insufficient virtual storage is available to perform the OPEN command.
3. The characteristics of the SYSIN data set are different from those expected by the print log map (DSNJU004)
utility.
System action: DSNJU004 attempts to continue processing without an input control statement. DB2 writes this
message to the SYSPRINT data set, not to the system console.
User response: Take one of the following actions based on the cause of the error.
1. Provide the missing DD statement and rerun the utility.
2. Insufficient virtual storage is usually accompanied by a separate error message from the MVS operating system.
Increase the REGION size on the JCL job step and rerun the utility.
3. Check that the SYSIN data set is a fixed record format (blocked or unblocked) with an LRECL of 80. You might
need to contact the system programmer for help if this is a JES data set.

DSNJ247E csect-name I/O ERROR DURING PROCESSING OF rrr RC = rc, REASON = reason
Explanation: The I/O error occurred at record 'rrr'. 'rc' indicates the return code received from the I/O operation.
'reason' indicates the reason code received from the I/O operation.
If a return code '4' was received, this indicates that the log manager detected a problem. If a return code '8' was
received, this indicates a VSAM error.
System action: DB2 startup terminates.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
For a return code of '4', if you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about
identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
For a return code of '8', execute an offline access method services job to determine the cause of the VSAM error.
DSNJ248I ARCHIVE LOG READ DEALLOCATION INITIALIZATION PROCESSING FAILED
Explanation: During log initialization, the archive log read deallocation process was unable to complete its
initialization.
System action: DB2 startup is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: One or more error messages describing the specific error precede this message. Refer
to these messages for error analysis and the appropriate action to take.
DSNJ249I ARCHIVE LOG READ SCHEDULER INITIALIZATION PROCESSING FAILED
Explanation: During log initialization, the archive log read scheduling process was unable to complete its
initialization.

Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: One or more error messages describing the specific error precede this message. Refer
to these messages for error analysis and the appropriate action to take.
DSNJ250E csect-name DATA SHARING REQUIRES ALL ACTIVE LOG DATA SETS TO BE DEFINED WITH SHAREOPTIONS(2 3) OR HIGHER.
Explanation: DB2 detected an active log data set defined with share options that do not permit recovery operations
in a data sharing environment. This message is followed by message DSNJ251E, which identifies the specific active
log data set.
All active log data sets for a DB2 data sharing member must be defined with a minimum of SHAREOPTIONS(2 3)
for successful DB2 initialization. See the description of message DSNJ251E for more details.
System action: The DB2 subsystem detecting this condition is terminated.
DSNJ251E csect-name DATA SET dsname FAILS TO MEET THE MINIMUM REQUIRED SHAREOPTIONS FOR DATA SHARING.
Explanation: The share options defined for the data set named in the message are too low to permit the data set to
participate in a DB2 data sharing group. All active log data sets must be defined with SHAREOPTIONS(2 3) or
higher in order to participate in a data sharing group.
System action: The DB2 subsystem detecting this error is terminated.
System programmer response: Using IDCAMS LISTCAT or TSO LISTCAT, display the share options of all of the
active log data sets of all of the members in the data sharing group. For any active log data set that is defined with
less than SHAREOPTIONS(2 3), use IDCAMS ALTER or TSO ALTER to alter the data set definitions to
SHAREOPTIONS(2 3) or higher.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v IDCAMS LISTCAT output that shows the attributes of all active log data sets for the DB2 member that failed.
.
DSNJ253I csect-name alias-port USE IS INVALID
Explanation: The alias-port value has been used in an invalid manner. The error could be due to one of the following
conditions:
v alias-port was specified after more than one alias-name parameter
v alias-port duplicates the port value for the PORT or RESPORT parameters which have been specified with this
update, or are already stored in the BSDS
System action: The update of the BSDS will not be performed.
User response: Retry the BSDS update with unique alias-port values, which also do not match the values for the
PORT or RESPORT parameters.
DSNJ254I xxxx NUMBER OF PARAMETER ARGUMENTS EXCEED MAXIMUM VALUE
Explanation: The number of arguments for the parameter named xxxx exceed the maximum value allowed.
System action: The current operation is terminated. This message is written to the SYSPRINT data set, but not
written to a console.
User response: Change the number of parameter arguments on the control statement, and rerun the utility.
DSNJ255I csect-name CONDITIONAL RESTART ENDTIME OF end-time WILL RESULT IN LOG TRUNCATION AT xxxx yyyyyyyyyyyy
Explanation: The conditional restart control record in use indicates that the DB2 log should be truncated with
ENDTIME end-time. The ENDTIME value translates to truncation type xxxx with value yyyyyyyyyyyy. This value is
either an LRSN value (for data sharing) or a STCK (store clock) value (for non-data sharing).
System action: Startup continues.
User response: Reply Y to the DSNJ245I WTOR if this value is the correct log truncation value.
DSNJ256I csect-name CONDITIONAL RESTART RECORD INDICATES SYSPITR RESTART WITH NO LOG TRUNCATION
Explanation: The conditional restart control record in use indicates that DB2 will be restarted in system recover
pending mode without truncating the logs. No database update activity will be allowed, and DB2 will be in restricted
access mode.
System action: Startup continues.
Operator response: Reply 'Y' to the DSNJ011I WTOR if this is correct.
DSNJ260I csect_name BSDS CONVERSION FOR DDNAME=nnnnnnnn COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
Explanation: The BSDS conversion utility issues this message to indicate a successful conversion for the BSDS data
set specified by the nnnnnnnn DDNAME.
System action: Processing continues.
DSNJ261I csect_name BSDS CONVERSION FOR DDNAME=nnnnnnnn WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL
Explanation: The BSDS conversion utility issues this message to indicate conversion was not successful for the BSDS
data set specified by the nnnnnnnn DDNAME.
System action: The action taken depends on whether dual BSDS data sets are specified, and if so, which conversion
failed. The DDNAME in the message indicates the failing BSDS data set.
If dual BSDS data sets are specified, the SYSUT1 data set is converted first. If that conversion is successful, the
SYSUT2 data set is then converted. A failure at this point does not affect the successful SYSUT1 conversion.
If conversion fails for the SYSUT1 data set, processing is terminated at that point. In this case, any SYSUT2 data set
that was specified will not be converted.
User response: Review other messages produced by the utility to determine the cause of the failure and the
resulting action to take.
DSNJ266I WARNING - BSDS UTILITY TIMESTAMP MISMATCH DETECTED. PROCESSING TERMINATED.
Explanation: DB2 detected a mismatch in the timestamps for the SYSUT1 and SYSUT2 BSDS copies during
execution of a BSDS conversion utility. This mismatch indicates the possibility that the dual BSDSs are out of sync.
System action: The program terminates with no action taken.
System programmer response: Run the print log map utility (DSNJU004) against each BSDS. From the output,
determine which data set is obsolete, delete it, and define a replacement for it. Then copy the remaining data set into
the replacement and try the utility again.
If output from the print log map utility for both data sets is similar, delete the data set with the oldest timestamp,
and copy the data set with the most recent timestamp into the replacement.

DSNJ301I csect-name ERROR action ONLINE BOOTSTRAP DATA SET
Explanation: During command processing for the -RECOVER BSDS command or the -ARCHIVE LOG command, an
error occurred while performing an operation on the bootstrap data set (BSDS). The type of operation is specified in
the 'action' keyword in the message text:
v ACCESSING: Unable to OPEN the BSDS.
v READING: Unable to read a required record from the BSDS.
v UPDATING: Unable to write a required record to the BSDS.
v RESTORING DUAL: The contents of the stable BSDS was successfully copied to the replacement BSDS; however,
the DB2 subsystem was unable to successfully restore dual BSDS operation.
System action: If this message was received during processing of the -RECOVER BSDS command, the DB2
subsystem will continue in single BSDS mode. If this message was received during processing of the -ARCHIVE LOG
command, the archive log history record in the BSDS will not be updated to reflect the occurrence of an -ARCHIVE
LOG command; logging and the offload processing will continue.
Operator response: Inform the system programmer of the type of error that occurred, and whether the error
occurred while processing a -RECOVER BSDS command or an -ARCHIVE LOG command.
System programmer response: If this message was received during processing of the -RECOVER BSDS command,
recovery action must be performed on the bootstrap data set before reentering the command. If this message was
received during processing of the -ARCHIVE LOG command, no action is necessary.
DSNJ302I ALLOCATION ERROR ON REPLACEMENT BSDS DSNAME=... ERROR STATUS=...
Explanation: The RECOVER BSDS command encountered an error while trying to dynamically allocate the specified
data set. DSNAME is the data set name. Error Status is the error code and information code returned by MVS
dynamic allocation.
System action: Processing of the command is terminated. The system continues in single BSDS mode.
Operator response: Determine the cause of the error from the error status contained in the message, and correct the
condition. Then reenter the -RECOVER BSDS command.
System programmer response: The error status portion of this message contains the 2-byte error code (S99ERROR)
followed by the 2-byte information code (S99INFO) from the SVC request block. Refer to the appropriate MVS
publication for a description of these codes.
DSNJ303I WRITE ERROR ON REPLACEMENT BSDS DSNAME=... ERROR STATUS=...
Explanation: The -RECOVER BSDS command encountered an error while attempting to write to the specified
bootstrap data set. Error Status contains the VSAM return and feedback codes. It is a 2-byte field with the first
containing the hexadecimal return code and the second containing the hexadecimal feedback code.
System action: Processing of the command is terminated. The system continues in single BSDS mode.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Execute an offline access method services job to delete or rename the replacement
BSDS and define a new BSDS with the same name. Reenter the log manager -RECOVER BSDS command to
reestablish dual BSDS mode.
DSNJ304I ERROR CLOSING REPLACEMENT BSDS DSNAME=... ERROR STATUS=...
Explanation: The -RECOVER BSDS command encountered an error while attempting to close the specified bootstrap
data set. Error Status contains the VSAM return and feedback codes. It is a 2-byte field with the first containing the
hexadecimal return code and the second containing the hexadecimal feedback code.
System action: Processing of the command is terminated. The system continues in single BSDS mode.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Execute an offline access method services job to delete or rename the replacement
BSDS and define a new BSDS with the same name. Reenter the log manager -RECOVER BSDS command to
reestablish dual BSDS mode.
DSNJ305I REPLACEMENT BSDS NOT EMPTY DSNAME=...
Explanation: The -RECOVER BSDS command was issued, but the replacement bootstrap data set was not empty;
that is, it contained data.
System action: Processing of the command is terminated. DB2 continues in single BSDS mode.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Execute an offline access method services job to delete or rename the error BSDS and
define a new BSDS with the same name. Reenter the log manager -RECOVER BSDS command to reestablish dual
BSDS mode.
DSNJ306I DUAL BSDS MODE ALREADY ESTABLISHED
Explanation: The -RECOVER BSDS command was issued, but DB2 was already in dual BSDS mode.
System action: The command is ignored.
DSNJ307I LOG INITIALIZED IN SINGLE BSDS MODE
Explanation: The -RECOVER BSDS command was issued, but the system was initialized in single BSDS mode.
System action: Processing of the command is terminated. The system continues in single BSDS mode.
DSNJ310I (A)SYNCHRONOUS ARCHIVE LOG COMMAND QUIESCE PROCESSING STARTED FOR MAXIMUM OF xxx SECONDS
Explanation: An -ARCHIVE LOG command with the MODE(QUIESCE) option has been accepted by the DB2
subsystem. The quiesce processing has commenced.
System action: The DB2 subsystem will attempt to stop all updates to DB2 resources within the time period
specified in the message. Users/jobs operating on the DB2 subsystem will be allowed to reach a point of consistency
(commit point) before being blocked from further update activity. Jobs and users will be suspended until they are
released by DB2 following the initiation of the offload processing. If the DB2 subsystem can effectively block all users
from performing updates before the maximum specified time, the offload will be initiated immediately, and normal
processing will be resumed.
The message will display either the word SYNCHRONOUS or ASYNCHRONOUS, to inform the user of the type of
quiesce processing which has been used.
v If the word SYNCHRONOUS is displayed, then the invoker used the WAIT(YES) option. This means that quiesce
processing will be synchronous to the user; that is, the user can enter additional DB2 commands, but the
commands will not be processed by the DB2 command processor until the quiesce processing has ended.
v If the word ASYNCHRONOUS is displayed, then the invoker used the WAIT(NO) option, or did not specify the
WAIT option. This means that quiesce processing will be asynchronous to the user; that is, control will be returned
to the invoker as soon as the quiesce task has been started. Thus, the DB2 command processor will accept - and
process - any new DB2 commands while the quiesce task is running.
This message will be followed by message DSNJ311I or DSNJ317I.
Operator response: No operator response is necessary. However, it can be expected that users and jobs using DB2
resources will be suspended (queued) by DB2 through the duration of the specified time interval, or until the DB2
subsystem can be certain that all update activity has been effectively blocked. At some point, this message will be
followed by the DSNJ311I message or DSNJ317I message.
DSNJ311I csect-name ASYNCHRONOUS LOG ARCHIVE (OFFLOAD) TASK INITIATED
Explanation: A user-initiated -ARCHIVE LOG command has been accepted by the DB2 subsystem. An
asynchronous task to archive (offload) the active log data set has been started.
System action: The current active log data set(s) will be truncated and switched to the next available active log data
set(s), and an asynchronous offload task will be initiated to archive the Active log data set(s).
The term ASYNCHRONOUS is used to indicate that control will be returned to the invoker as soon as the offload
task has been started. Thus, the DB2 command processor will accept and process any DB2 commands while the
offload task is running.
This message is followed by message DSNJ312I if the MODE(QUIESCE) option was used with the -ARCHIVE LOG
command.
Operator response: The operator should respond per normal operational procedures when the offload task begins.
DSNJ312I ARCHIVE LOG QUIESCE ENDED. UPDATE ACTIVITY AGAINST DB2 RESOURCES IS NOW RESUMED.
Explanation: An -ARCHIVE LOG command with the MODE(QUIESCE) option was processed by the DB2
subsystem. As part of the MODE(QUIESCE) processing, an attempt was made to stop all new update activity against
DB2 resources. This message signals the end of the quiesce processing, and the resumption of normal DB2 activity for
all users and jobs which were blocked during the quiesce period.
This message follows message DSNJ311I or DSNJ317I.
System action: The DB2 subsystem has now resumed all normal DB2 activity for all users and jobs that were
blocked during the quiesce period.
DSNJ313I PARAMETER SPECIFIED ON THE keyword KEYWORD (value) IS NOT IN THE RANGE OF ALLOWABLE VALUES
Explanation: This message was generated by an error occurring in one of the following commands:
v ARCHIVE LOG command with MODE(QUIESCE)
v SET ARCHIVE
v SET LOG
You specified a value for one of the command options that was outside of the range of allowed values.
System action: Processing for the ARCHIVE LOG, SET ARCHIVE, or SET LOG command is terminated. This
message is followed by message DSN9023I.
Operator response: Correct the syntax and reissue the command.

DSNJ314I keyword-1 KEYWORD REQUIRES keyword-2 KEYWORD TO ALSO BE SPECIFIED ON THE COMMAND
Explanation: A command was entered which specified the keyword-1 keyword. However, use of the keyword-1
keyword requires that the keyword-2 keyword also be used.
System action: Command processing terminates for the -ARCHIVE LOG or -RECOVER BSDS command. This
message is followed by message DSN9023I.
Operator response: Correct the syntax and reissue the command.

DSNJ315I -STOP DB2 MODE(FORCE) IN PROGRESS
Explanation: An attempt was made to issue an -ARCHIVE LOG command when a -STOP DB2 MODE(FORCE)
command was already in progress.
System action: Command processing terminates for the -ARCHIVE LOG command. The -STOP DB2 MODE(FORCE)
processing continues.
DSNJ316I SYSTEM QUIESCE ALREADY IN PROGRESS
Explanation: An attempt was made to issue an -ARCHIVE LOG command with the MODE(QUIESCE) option when
a system quiesce was already in progress. The system quiesce could be the result of processing by another
-ARCHIVE LOG MODE(QUIESCE) command, or by a -STOP DB2 MODE(QUIESCE) command.
System action: Command processing will terminate. The system quiesce currently in progress will continue.
DSNJ317I ARCHIVE LOG QUIESCE PERIOD EXPIRED. NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING UR'S = xxxx.  ARCHIVE LOG PROCESSING WILL BE TERMINATED, AND UPDATE ACTIVITY AGAINST DB2 RESOURCES WILL BE RESUMED. HH:MM:SS
Explanation: An -ARCHIVE LOG MODE(QUIESCE) command was processed by the DB2 subsystem; however, the
DB2 subsystem was not able to quiesce all update activity in the user-specified quiesce time interval.
System action: This message is informational only. The DB2 subsystem determined that 'xxxx' units of recovery
(URs) did not reach a point of consistency during the quiesce period, and therefore could not be stopped from
continuing their associated update processing.
Consequently, the -ARCHIVE LOG processing will be terminated. The current active log data set(s) will not be
truncated, and will not be switched to the next available active log data set(s). The log archive (offload) task will not
be created. All jobs and users suspended during the quiesce will be resumed, and normal update activity against DB2
resources will be commenced.
This message will be followed by the DSNJ312I message.
Operator response: Contact the system programmer.
System programmer response: A determination must be made whether the outstanding (non-quiesced) URs
represent significant work.
Each user on the system has a unit of recovery if they are modifying DB2 resources. URs are also created by the DB2
subsystem itself for internal processing. Since the purpose of the MODE(QUIESCE) option is to have all URs reach a
point of consistency (commit point) before the active log data set is truncated and offloaded, determine all
outstanding non-queued jobs and users by using -DISPLAY THREAD and the MVS 'D A,L' operator command.
It should be noted that URs may be outstanding due to lock contention between a user or job which holds a resource
(and has reached a point of consistency), and a user or job which wants a lock (and therefore cannot reach a point of
consistency).
Before resubmitting the -ARCHIVE LOG command with the MODE(QUIESCE) option, either:
v Wait until the threads have been deallocated.
v Wait until the DB2 subsystem is less busy.
v Force the offending thread(s) to terminate.
v Use the TIME option to dynamically override and extend the maximum quiesce time period specified in subsystem
parameters.
v Or, if having all URs reach a point of consistency in the active log is no longer critical, issue the -ARCHIVE LOG
command without the MODE(QUIESCE) option.
Important: If the decision is made to use the -ARCHIVE LOG command without the MODE(QUIESCE) option, the
active log data set(s) will be truncated without regard to quiescing activity on the DB2 subsystem. If the resulting
archive log data set is used for recovery, it is possible that some URs may be found to be inflight, in-abort,
in-commit, or indoubt during DB2 initialization.
If expiration of the quiesce period before all URs reach a consistent point are a chronic problem, you might need to
adjust the value of the QUIESCE subsystem parameter.

DSNJ318I ARCHIVE LOG COMMAND ALREADY IN PROGRESS
Explanation: An attempt was made to issue an ARCHIVE LOG command when an ARCHIVE LOG command was
already in progress. In data sharing, the ARCHIVE LOG command currently in progress could be initiated by
another member.
Operator response: If the conflicting command satisfies your archival request, do not reissue the command.
Otherwise, wait for the conflicting command to complete and then reissue the -ARCHIVE LOG command.
DSNJ319I csect name CURRENT ACTIVE LOG DATA SET IS THE LAST AVAILABLE ACTIVE LOG DATA SET. ARCHIVE LOG PROCESSING WILL BE TERMINATED.
Explanation: The -ARCHIVE LOG command was rejected because the current active log is the last available active
log data set. To process the command when these conditions exist would cause the DB2 subsystem to exhaust its
available active log resources and immediately halt processing.
System action: Processing for the command is terminated. If the situation is not corrected, the DB2 subsystem will
issue the DSNJ110E message (if it has not already done so) as the available active log data space reaches critically low
levels. Ultimately, message DSNJ111E will be issued when the available active log data space is exhausted, and the
DB2 online processing will halt until active log space is made available.
Operator response: To clear this condition, steps must be taken to complete other waiting offload tasks. Once
another active log is made available (re-usable) by completing the offload process for it, the command processing for
the current active log can proceed.
Execute an MVS Display System Requests command (D R,L for example) to determine the outstanding requests related
to the log offload process. Take the necessary action to satisfy any requests, and permit offload to continue. If offload
fails to complete normally, or cannot be initiated, notify the systems programmer.
System programmer response: Either correct the problem that is causing the offload process to fail, or add more
active log data sets. Note that the latter action requires DB2 to be down and the change log inventory (DSNJU003)
utility to be run.
Possible causes for the shortage of active log data space are:
v Excessive logging. For example, too many users requesting logs at the same time, or too many utilities specifying
LOG (YES).
v Delayed or slow offloading. For example, failure to mount archive volumes, incorrect replies to offload messages,
or slow device speeds.
v Excessive use of the -ARCHIVE LOG command. Each invocation of the command causes the DB2 subsystem to
switch to a new active log data set. Excessive use could consume the available active log data space if the resulting
offloads were not processed in a timely manner.
v Off-loads(s) failed (see Operator Response).
v Insufficient active log space (see Operator Response).
User response: Notify the operator or system programmer.
DSNJ320I csect-name UNABLE TO PROCESS LOG TRUNCATION REQUEST DUE TO SUBSYSTEM COMPONENT action FAILURE
Explanation: While processing an -ARCHIVE LOG command, an internal request was made of the log buffer output
routine to force-write the log buffers and to truncate and switch the active log to the next available active log data
set(s). The request failed during the processing of the 'action' specified in the message.
System action: Processing for the command is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: This error is an internal error detected by the DB2 subsystem. The error may be
caused by an unrelated ABEND in the Log Buffer Writer component (DSNJWxxx), by a -STOP DB2 MODE(FORCE)
command, or by abnormal subsystem termination. Refer to messages and ABENDS which precede this message.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
DSNJ321I UNABLE TO CONTINUE ARCHIVE LOG QUIESCE DUE TO INTERNAL SUBSYSTEM ERROR.  ARCHIVE LOG PROCESSING WILL BE TERMINATED, AND UPDATE ACTIVITY AGAINST DB2 RESOURCES WILL BE RESUMED.
Explanation: An -ARCHIVE LOG command with the MODE(QUIESCE) option was processed by the DB2
subsystem. As part of the MODE(QUIESCE) processing, an attempt was made to stop all new update activity against
DB2 resources. During the internal subsystem interaction between the log manager and the recovery manager, an
internal interface error was detected by the recovery manager.
System action: The -ARCHIVE LOG MODE(QUIESCE) processing is terminated. This message will be followed by
message DSNJ312I after all users and jobs quiesced by the MODE(QUIESCE) processing are resumed.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: This error is an internal error detected by the DB2 subsystem. Retry the -ARCHIVE
LOG MODE(QUIESCE) command. If the error persists, the active log data sets may be switched using the -ARCHIVE
LOG command without the MODE(QUIESCE) option.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
DSNJ322I DISPLAY ARCHIVE REPORT FOLLOWS
Explanation: This message displays output from the DISPLAY ARCHIVE command. This output contains
information about archive log data sets that are in use for the subsystem or data-sharing member. For data-sharing
environments, it does not include information about the entire group.
The output begins with the following lines that describe the basic characteristics of the archive units for reading the
archive logs:

The count and time values that follow are the values that were specified during DB2 installation.
These values correspond to the following subsystem parameters:
v The count value is from the MAXRTU subsystem parameter.
v The time value is from the DEALLCT subsystem parameter.
CURRENT
The count and time values that follow are the current values in the DB2 subsystem. These values
might be the same as the subsystem parameter values that are listed in the DSNZPARM line.
However, if those values were overridden by the SET ARCHIVE command, this line lists those
changed values.
count The maximum number of tape units that can be allocated to concurrently read archive log tape volumes.
time The length of time that an allocated archive read tape unit can remain unused before it is deallocated. The
format is minutes,seconds.
After the information about archive units, the output contains the following lines:
===============================================
ADDR STAT CORR-ID VOLSER DATASET_NAME
addr status corr-id vname dsname
...
END OF DISPLAY ARCHIVE REPORT.
These lines describe the archive log data sets that are being read. After the heading information, one line is displayed
for each archive log data set that is being read. Each of those lines includes the following information:
addr The physical address of the device that is allocated to read the archive log.
status The status of the device, which can be one of the following values:
BUSY The device is actively processing an archive log data set.
PREM The device is active and allocated for premount.
AVL The device is inactive and waiting for work.
RCAL The archive data set is being recalled by HSM.
corr-id The correlation id that is associated with the user of the device that is being processed. If the status is PREM
or AVL, this column might contain *****, which indicates that a current user is not associated with this
device.
vname The name of the archive volume that is mounted at the device address.
dsname If status is BUSY, PREM or RCAL, the name of the data set on the archive volume that is being processed.
If status is AVL, the name of the data set on the archive volume that was last processed.
If no archive logs are currently being read, the following message is displayed instead of the lines that describe the
archive log data sets:

DSNJ330I ARCHIVE LOG VOLUMES REQUIRED FOR CONNECTION ID conn-id CORRELATION ID corr-id
Explanation: This message is the title for the ARCHIVE LOG VOLUMES report output. The ARCHIVE LOG
VOLUMES report lists the archive log volumes needed by the correlation ID for that connection ID. This message is
generated automatically by the archive read process at the first archive log tape mount for corr-id. This message
precedes the other messages generated by this action.
This message, in combination with messages DSNJ331I and DSNJ332I, provides the formatted report for the
ARCHIVE LOG VOLUMES requested.
conn-id
An identifier representing the 'connection name' used to establish the thread.
corr-id An identifier associated with a specified thread. In TSO, it is either the authorization ID or the job name.
DSNJ331I avolume, avolume, avolume, avolume ...
Explanation: This message provides the tape volume information for the Archive Log Volumes report output.
avolume
The name of the archive log volume required for this correlation ID. An 'avolume' prefixed with an '*'
signifies that the data on the archive log volume is also mapped by an active log data set. As such, the
'avolume' might not be required for the read process, since the data is read from the active log, if possible.
DSNJ332I END OF ARCHIVE LOG VOLUMES REPORT
Explanation: This message follows messages DSNJ330I and DSNJ331I and indicates that the ARCHIVE LOG
VOLUMES report was generated successfully. The message number is not included in this message.
DSNJ333I csect-name SYSTEM CHECKPOINT INITIATED
Explanation: This message indicates that the SET LOG command processed successfully and that a system
checkpoint has been initiated.
DSNJ334I PARAMETER SPECIFIED ON THE keyword KEYWORD (VALUE) CONTAINS INVALID CHARACTERS
Explanation: A -SET ARCHIVE command was processed by the DB2 subsystem. One of the command keywords

DSNJ336I UNABLE TO ALLOCATE TAPE UNIT FOR conn-id corr-id, x ALLOCATED, y ALLOWED.
Explanation: An attempt to allocate a tape unit for connection ID 'conn-id' failed. The current maximum tape unit
specified is 'y', but only 'x' are physically available.
System action: The 'conn-id corr-id' process is queued until either an allocated tape unit becomes free or more tape
units are varied online and made available to the DB2 archive read task.
Operator response: This situation rectifies itself over time as currently allocated tape units become available. To
improve throughput, vary additional tape units online and make them available to DB2. Note that a queue rescan is
not attempted until the -SET ARC READ COUNT command is issued or when an allocated tape dismounts.
DSNJ337I SET ARCHIVE COMMAND COMPLETED, COUNT (count) TIME (minute,second).
Explanation: This message indicates that the -SET ARCHIVE command processed successfully and displays the
current values for COUNT and TIME.

second The 'second' value for the TIME parameter
DSNJ339I csect-name SET LOG COMMAND COMPLETED, frequency-type(frequency-unit)
Explanation: This message indicates that the SET LOG command processed successfully, and displays the current
checkpoint frequency. The checkpoint frequency remains in effect until DB2 is restarted or until the value is modified
by a SET LOG or SET SYSPARM command.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
frequency-type
Identifies how the checkpoint frequency is determined. Expected values are CHKTIME (for a frequency
based on elapsed time) and LOGLOAD (for a frequency based on the number of log records that are
written).
frequency-unit
Specifies the unit for the associated frequency-type value.
The checkpoint frequency is controlled by the following fields on installation panel DSNTIPL1:
v CHECKPOINT TYPE (CHKTYPE subsystem parameter)
v RECORDS/CHECKPOINT (CHKFREQ and CHKLOGR subsystem parameters)
v MINUTES/CHECKPOINT (CHKFREQ and CHKMINS subsystem parameters)
Multiple forms: This message has two forms. The short form is shown above. The long form is:csect-name SET LOG
COMMAND COMPLETED, frequency-type(frequency-unit) OR frequency-type(frequency-unit) The long form is used
when both the number of minutes and number of log records were changed by the SET LOG command. The message
shows the frequency-type and frequency-unit values for both.
System action: Processing continues, and DB2 issues a DSNJ371I message to show the current settings.

Explanation: An attempt was made to issue a DB2 command with KEYWORD xxx on a DB2 that was not initialized
to participate in data sharing.
System action: The command request is rejected.
DSNJ341I csect-name -ARCHIVE LOG COMMAND NOT ALLOWED, LOGGING IS SUSPENDED
Explanation: An attempt to issue an -ARCHIVE LOG command failed because a -SET LOG SUSPEND command
has suspended logging.
System action: Command processing terminates for the -ARCHIVE LOG command. You may reissue the command
when logging has been resumed by the -SET LOG RESUME command.
DSNJ350I csect-name (A)SYNCHRONOUS ARCHIVE LOG COMMAND QUIESCE PROCESSING STARTED IN DATA SHARING
Explanation: The DB2 subsystem of a data sharing group accepted an ARCHIVE LOG command with the
MODE(QUIESCE) option.
Each active DB2 member in the data sharing group performs the quiesce operation. The member originating the
quiesce issues message DSNJ350I; all other members issue DSNJ310I as they start quiescing.
DSNJ351I csect-name MEMBER member name STATUS=member status
Explanation: This message is one of a list of elements that display archive related status of the indicated member of
the data sharing group. These member status messages are preceded by the message DSNJ359I and are followed by DSNJ361I.
member name identifies the member of the data sharing group.
member status indicates archive related status of the named member. It appears as one of the following:.
ABNORMALLY TERMINATING
The named member was undergoing abnormal subsystem termination at the time ARCHIVE LOG
processing was active for the data sharing group. ARCHIVE LOG command processing for the remainder of
the data sharing group terminates unsuccessfully.
ARCHIVE ALREADY ACTIVE
ARCHIVE LOG command processing was running at the named member at the time a succeeding
ARCHIVE LOG command was issued. The succeeding ARCHIVE LOG command terminates unsuccessfully
for the remaining members of the data sharing group.
CANCELED
ARCHIVE LOG command processing for the named member was canceled due to a problem encountered
elsewhere in the data sharing group. The quiesce operation is interrupted and terminated and update
activity against DB2 resources is resumed before command processing is terminated for the member.
COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE
A communications failure occurred between the named member and one or more other members in the data
sharing group. The quiesce operation is interrupted and update activity against DB2 resources is resumed
before command processing is terminated for the member. ARCHIVE LOG command processing for the
remainder of the data sharing group terminates unsuccessfully.
FAILED
The named member was inactive at the time the ARCHIVE LOG command was issued. Termination of the
DB2 subsystem for this member was abnormal. This status, if displayed for any member, will cause
ARCHIVE LOG command processing for the entire data sharing group to terminate unsuccessfully.
NOT AVAILABLE
Archive command status for the named member could not be determined. This condition typically occurs
when the named member fails to respond during ARCHIVE LOG command processing and is usually
accompanied by message DSNJ353I and/or message DSNJ355I.
QUIESCED
The named member was active at the time the ARCHIVE LOG command was issued. Update activity
against DB2 resources had successfully quiesced for that member (no active URs) in response to specifying
MODE(QUIESCE).
QUIESCED/OFFLOADING
The named member was active at the time the ARCHIVE LOG command was issued. Update activity
against DB2 resources had successfully quiesced for that member (no active URs) in response to specifying
MODE(QUIESCE). The active log at the time was truncated and an offload process was initiated after all
members in the data sharing group had reached a quiesce point.
STOPPED
The named member was inactive at the time the ARCHIVE LOG command was issued. Termination of the
DB2 subsystem for this member was normal with no incomplete URs outstanding. Log truncation and
offload processing are scheduled to be performed automatically the next time the named member is started.
When the member is started, it is important to ensure that archive processing occurs automatically. Certain
error conditions might require entering an ARCHIVE LOG command via the operator console to cause log
truncation and offload processing to be performed. This member status is accompanied by warning message DSNJ362A.
TIME EXCEEDED
The named member could not quiesce its update activity within the allotted period of time. The incomplete
quiesce operation is interrupted and update activity is resumed before command processing is terminated
for the member. ARCHIVE LOG command processing for the remainder of the data sharing group is
unsuccessfully terminated.
DSNJ352W csect-name MEMBERS WERE NOT OFFLOADED
Explanation: DB2 issues this message during processing of an ARCHIVE LOG command with the MODE(QUIESCE)
option. One or more quiesced members were not available to receive the archive request. DSNJ351I messages follow
to display the quiesced members.
At the next start up of the quiesced member, DB2 switches (truncates) the current active log and initiates the archive
task.
DSNJ353I csect-name DSNJ353I MEMBER member name NOT RESPONDING.
Explanation: This message is displayed when a response is needed but not received within an expected period of
time during ARCHIVE LOG MODE(QUIESCE) command processing. This can occur as a result of abnormal
subsystem termination under the named member or, possibly from communications problems among members of the
data sharing group.
Operator response: Examine the console log of the named member for operator information messages that might
relate to the problem.
DSNJ354I csect-name DSNJ354I ARCHIVE LOG: ALL ACTIVE MEMBER(S) STARTED OFFLOAD TASKS
Explanation: This message is displayed when MODE(QUIESCE) is specified with the ARCHIVE LOG command,
after all active members in the data sharing group have successfully quiesced their update activity within the allotted
time period. For each active member in the data sharing group, the active log is truncated and switched, and an
offload task is initiated to begin the offload process. Log truncation, switch and offload processing for stopped (and
quiesced) members is performed the next time they are started.
DSNJ355I csect-name ARCHIVE LOG: ONE OR MORE ACTIVE MEMBERS FAILED TO RESPOND OR START OFFLOAD TASKS
Explanation: This message is displayed when MODE(QUIESCE) is specified with the ARCHIVE LOG command,
and one or more active members could not successfully quiesce their update activity in the time allotted. Subsystem
activity already quiesced is resumed, and ARCHIVE LOG command processing terminates unsuccessfully for all
active members in the data sharing group. Message DSNJ353I might also appear with this message.
Operator response: See the list of DSNJ351I member status messages following message DSNJ359I to determine the
reason for the archive command failure.
DSNJ356I csect-name COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE TERMINATED COMMAND
Explanation: This message appears as a result of the failure of a communications request by one or more members
of the data sharing group. This message is likely to be accompanied by DSN7xxx or other error messages and/or an
SVC dump.
System action: ARCHIVE LOG command processing terminates unsuccessfully for all members in the group.
DSNJ357E csect-name SYSTEM QUIESCE FAILED
Explanation: This message indicates the unsuccessful outcome of an ARCHIVE LOG MODE(QUIESCE) command.
This message indicates that one or more members were unable to quiesce their update activity in the time allowed. It
is usually accompanied by one or more related messages (e.g., DSNJ355I), and a list of member status messages
indicating the reason for the failure.
Operator response: Refer to messages DSNJ359I, DSNJ351I and DSNJ361I to determine archive related status of
members in the data sharing group.
DSNJ359I MEMBER RESPONSES
Explanation: This message marks the beginning of a list of one or more DSNJ351I member status messages and
precedes the first status message in the list.
DSNJ361I csect-name END OF MEMBER RESPONSES LIST
Explanation: This message marks the end of a list of one or more DSNJ351I member status messages and follows
the last status message in the list.
DSNJ362E csect-name WARNING: LOGS OF nn STOPPED OR FAILED MEMBERS NOT OFFLOADED.
Explanation: This message is displayed when either MODE(QUIESCE) or SCOPE(GROUP) is specified with the
ARCHIVE LOG command, and one or more members of the data sharing group either stopped or failed and were
not available to receive the archive request. Active log truncation, log switch and offload processing for these inactive
members is scheduled to be performed the next time those members are started.
Operator response: Verify that log switch and offload processing does automatically occur when the inactive
members are started. Certain error conditions might require the ARCHIVE LOG command to be individually issued
for a member if ARCHIVE LOG processing does not occur automatically. Refer to messages DSNJ359I, DSNJ351I, and DSNJ361I to identify the inactive members.
DSNJ363I csect-name COPY log-copy LOG DATA SET dataset-name ADDED TO THE ACTIVE LOG INVENTORY
Explanation: The active log data set identified bydataset-name was successfully added to active log inventory with
the SET LOG command. The log data set is now available for use by DB2.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
log-copy The new log copy.
dataset-name
The name of the data set.
System action: Processing continues.
User response: No action is required.

NEWLOG data set name is correct.
LOG COPY AT MAXIMUM NUMBER OF LOGS
The specified log copy already contains the maximum number of active log data sets. You can specify up to
a maximum of 93 log data sets per active log copy.
COPY2 IN SINGLE LOGGING MODE
COPY(2) was specified but DB2 was started in single logging mode.
OUT OF SPACE IN BSDS
There is no space in the BSDS to add the new log data set information. This failure indicates a possible
problem with the BSDS control record. If the problem persists, contact IBM Software Support. Prepare an
IDCAMS PRINT of the BSDS.
COMMAND ABENDED
An ABEND occurred during command processing.
System action: The command terminates.
User response: Examine the console log for messages related to the failure.

console.
User response: Note the record identifier for future reference.
DSNJ412E csect-name RESTART CONTROL RECORD NOT FOUND IN BSDS
Explanation: The CRESTART CANCEL keyword was specified but the conditional restart control record does not
exist in the BSDS data set.
System action: Current utility processing is terminated. This message is written to the SYSPRINT data set, not to a
console.
User response: CREATE the conditional restart control record prior to attempting the CANCEL function.
DSNJ413E csect-name INVALID LOG RANGE SCOPE OR CHECKPOINT SPECIFIED
Explanation: The values specified thru the STARTRBA, ENDRBA, and CHKPTRBA keywords are invalid.
System action: Current utility processing is terminated. This message is written to the SYSPRINT data set, not to a
console.
User response: Ensure that the log range values are correct and correspond to the other log range values either
specified or defaulted. A valid log range is where STARTRBA is less than or equal to CHKPTRBA, and CHKPTRBA
is less than ENDRBA. The STARTRBA most be less than or equal to the ENDRBA.
DSNJ414I csect-name COLD START WILL RESULT FROM THIS RESTART CONTROL RECORD. FORWARD AND BACKOUT SET TO NO.

Explanation: The specified ENDRBA at 'rba' is not a multiple of 4KB.
System action: CRESTART processing is terminated.
User response: Correct the ENDRBA value on the CRESTART statement and rerun the utility.
DSNJ416I WARNING - BSDS UTILITY TIMESTAMP MISMATCH DETECTED. PROCESSING CONTINUES.
Explanation: As a result of a change log inventory (DSNJU003) update, it was discovered that the SYSUT1 BSDS
and SYSUT2 BSDS timestamps are unequal. Being unequal indicates the possibility of a BSDS mismatch.
System action: Current utility processing continues.
User response: Run the print log map (DSNJU004) utility against the SYSUT1 BSDS and SYSUT2 BSDS. Determine
if each BSDS is current. If each BSDS is current, this warning can be ignored. If either BSDS is not current, delete the
obsolete data set and define a replacement data set, then copy the current BSDS into the replacement data set.
DSNJ417I REQUIRED xxxxxxxx PARAMETER FOR yyyyyyyy OPERATION IS MISSING
Explanation: A required parameter 'xxxxxxxx' for a Log utility operation was missing from the Log utility control
statement. The attempted operation is 'yyyyyyyy'.
System action: The Log utility 'yyyyyyyy' operation does not perform its function. All subsequent Log utility
control statements are processed. A nonzero return code is issued by the utility.
DB2 writes this message to the SYSPRINT data set, not to a console.
User response: Add the missing parameter to the control statements associated with the specified operation and
rerun the utility.

Otherwise, re-create the deleted log by using the NEWLOG statement with the RBA values specified in the warning
message.
DSNJ419I UNABLE TO WRITE ARCHIVE LOG RECORD TO THE BSDS DATASET. DDNAME=xxxxxx
Explanation: A program encountered an I/O error when attempting to write a BSDS archive record to the BSDS
data set. 'xxxxxx' is the DDNAME of the BSDS data set being accessed.
System action: The program will terminate.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: One or more error messages describing the specific error preceded this message.
This error is considered unrecoverable and will leave the BSDS data set in an uncertain state. It will be necessary to
either: re-create the data set using access method service routines and then use change log inventory (DSNJU003)
utility to make the active and archive log data set(s) known to the BSDS, or recover the BSDS using a backup copy.
DSNJ420I UNABLE TO WRITE BCR1 RECORD TO BSDS DATASET. DDNAME=xxxxxx
Explanation: A program encountered an I/O error when attempting to write the BSDS control record to the BSDS
data set. 'xxxxxx' is the DDNAME of the BSDS data set being accessed.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: One or more error messages describing the specific error preceded this message.
Refer to the specific message(s) for error analysis and the appropriate action to take.
DSNJ421I THE BSDS IS NOT AT THE PROPER RELEASE LEVEL. DDNAME=xxxxx
Explanation: This message is issued when a program attempting to access The BSDS data set is not at a compatible
release level. This can be one of the following:
v The program accessing the BSDS data set is at a NEW release level and the BSDS is at the old level.
v The program accessing the BSDS data set is at an OLD release level and the BSDS is at the NEW level.
v The program encountered an UNKNOWN release level on the BSDS data set.
System action: The program will terminate with no action taken.
System programmer response: If the program that encountered the error was one of the BSDS conversion programs
(DSNJMIG0 or DSNJFAL0) an unrecoverable error was found on the BSDS data set and it must be re-created. If the
error was encountered running some other utility program (i.e., change log inventory or print log map), one of the
following actions may be taken:
v Run a version of the program that is compatible with the release level of the BSDS.
v Run the appropriate formatting program (DSNJMIG0 or DSNJFAL0) to convert the BSDS data set to a release level
compatible with the running program. If this was successful, rerun the original program.
DSNJ422I LOG RECORDS HAVE ALREADY BEEN FORMATTED - THIS UTILITY WILL TERMINATE
Explanation: This message occurs when one of the BSDS formatting programs detects the BSDS had already been
reformatted or was already at the required format level.
System action: The program will terminate without any action being taken.
System programmer response: If the appropriate BSDS formatting program was being run, no further action is
necessary.
DSNJ423I ACTIVE LOG MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ARCHIVED. DSN=xxxxxx
Explanation: The program was attempting to convert an old BSDS data set with more than 31 active log data sets to
the new format. The program will drop the oldest active log data set(s) to get to the new maximum (31) limit. When
dropping one of the old active log data sets from the BSDS, it was found to have been flagged as NOT REUSABLE
(i.e., this data set MAY NOT have been archived). 'xxxxxx' will contain the data set name of the active log in
question.
System action: The program will remove this active log data set from the BSDS and continue.
System programmer response: Check to see if this data set had been archived. The active log data set was not
deleted on disk but removed only from the BSDS data set, so it may still be archived, if needed. Use access method
service routines to copy the VSAM active log data set to a sequential archive log data set.
DSNJ424I csect-name INVALID CONTROL STATEMENT. THE SECOND WORD MUST BE 'DDNAME' OR '*' OR MUST START WITH A PARENTHESIS.
Explanation: The control statement is invalid.
System action: The control statement is ignored. DB2 uses the SYSUT1 DD statement to locate the BSDS to be
mapped. If the SYSUT1 DD statement is not available, the utility terminates.
User response: Correct or remove the control statement and rerun the job.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
Collect the following diagnostic items:

System action:
CRESTART FAILED: SYSPITR LRSN MUST BE GREATER THAN minimum-value OF LAST MEMBER
DESTRUCTION
An attempt was made to use a CRESTART statement to create a conditional restart record for
system point in time recovery. However, the CRESTART statement specified a log truncation point
LRSN that is before the most recent member destruction. The logs of the destroyed member are no
longer available. The minimum LRSN value is indicated in the message as minimum-value.
User response: Specify an LRSN that is greater than the minimum value indicated in the message.
CRESTART FAILED: SYSPITRT TIMESTAMP MUST BE GREATER THAN minimum-value OF LAST
MEMBER DESTRUCTION
An attempt was made to use a CRESTART statement to create a conditional restart record for
system point in time recovery. However, the CRESTART statement specified a log truncation point
time stamp that is before the most recent member destruction. The logs of the destroyed member
are no longer available. The minimum time stamp value is indicated in the message as
minimum-value.
User response: Specify a time stamp that is more recent than the minimum value indicated in the

DEACTIV ON A MEMBER ALREADY DEACTIVATED
DELMBR DEACTIV was requested for a member that has already completed deactivation
processing.
DEACTIV ON A MEMBER ALREADY DESTROYED
DELMBR DEACTIV was requested for a member that has already completed destruction
processing.
DEACTIV ON A MEMBER ALREADY MARKED FOR DEACTIVATION
DELMBR DEACTIV was requested for a member that has already been marked for deactivation,
but the deactivation process has not yet completed.
System action: The state of the member is unchanged.
DEACTIV ON A MEMBER ALREADY MARKED FOR DESTRUCTION
DELMBR DEACTIV was requested for a member that has already been marked for destruction by a
previous DESTROY request.
DEACTIV ON A NON-EXISTENT MEMBER IN NON-DATA SHARING
An attempt was made to deactivate a member from the BSDS of a non-data sharing DB2
subsystem. Deactivation is allowed in data sharing mode only.
User response: Verify the member ID.
DESTROY ON A MEMBER ALREADY DESTROYED
DELMBR DESTROY was requested for a member that has already completed destruction
processing.
DESTROY ON A MEMBER ALREADY MARKED FOR DESTRUCTION
DELMBR DESTROY was requested for a member that has already been marked for destruction but
the destruction process has not yet completed.
System action: The state of the member is unchanged.
DESTROY ON A NON-EXISTENT MEMBER IN NON-DATA SHARING
An attempt was made to destroy a member from the BSDS of a non-data sharing DB2 subsystem.
Destruction is allowed in data sharing mode only.
User response: Verify the member ID.
INVALID AFTER A NON-DELMBR OR NON-RSTMBR OPERATION
A control statement other than DELMBR or RSTMBR preceded the current DELMBR or RSTMBR
statement. The statement is not allowed if the BSDS being processed belongs to the target member.
The DELMBR or RSTMBR statement is not processed.
User response: Restart the member that owns the BSDS so that previous changes to the BSDS can
be processed.
INVALID AFTER DELMBR OR RSTMBR OPERATION
A control statement other than DELMBR or RSTMBR was issued for a data sharing group member
that is queued for deletion. When DELMBR or RSTMBR is input to DSNJU003, no other operations
are allowed if the BSDS that is being processed belongs to the target member.
System action: The other control statements are not processed. If the BSDS that belongs to the
target member is marked as deactivated or destroyed by a previous invocation, no further updates
to the BSDS are allowed. The exception is if the target member was deactivated and an RSTMBR
operation is requested.
INVALID WITH HOST MEMBER IN DEACTIV/DESTROY STATE
A control statement other than RSTMBR was issued for a data sharing group member that has been
deactivated. When a data sharing group member has been deactivated, the only control statement
that DSNJU003 accepts for that member's BSDS is RSTMBR. When a member is marked as
destroyed in its own BSDS, DSNJU003 rejects all statements that would alter the BSDS contents.
MEMBER ALREADY DESTROYED
RSTMBR was requested for a member that was destroyed. RSTMBR can be used only when a
member is deactivated or marked for deactivation.
MEMBER ALREADY MARKED FOR DESTRUCTION
RSTMBR was requested for a member that was marked for destruction but not yet completely
destroyed. RSTMBR can be used only when a member is deactivated or marked for deactivation.
User response: If a backup copy of the BSDS is available from before DELMBR DESTROY was
used, restore the backup.
MEMBER HAS NOT BEEN DEACTIVATED
Either RSTMBR or DELMBR DESTROY was requested for a member that is not deactivated or
marked for deactivation. A DELMBR DESTROY can immediately follow a DELMBR DEACTIV for
the same member ID, but a DELMBR DEACTIV is always required first.
User response: Either complete the deactivation process or use DELMBR DEACTIV followed by
DELMBR DESTROY for the target member.
MEMBER HAS NOT BEEN QUIESCED
DELMBR was requested for a member that has not been quiesced or was active when the member
that owns the BSDS was shut down. A member must be quiesced before a DELMBR command will
be accepted.
User response: Quiesce the target member. To update the state of the target member, restart the
member that owns the BSDS that DSNJU003 was running against.
NON-EXISTENT MEMBER IN NON-DATA SHARING
RSTMBR was requested for a nonexistent member and the BSDS indicates the member that owns
the BSDS is not part of a data sharing group. In a non-data sharing environment, RSTMBR can be
used only for a known member that has been marked for deactivation through the DELMBR
DEACTIV statement.
User response: Indicate a different member number.
UTILITY TIMESTAMP GREATER THAN SYSTEM TIMESTAMP. MEMBER RESTART REQUIRED.
DELMBR was requested, but failed because an earlier change to the BSDS updated the utility time
stamp. The member must be restarted before DELMBR can be used.
User response: Restart the member that owns the BSDS before using DELMBR DEACTIV.
VALID MEMBER ID IS 1 TO 32 DECIMAL
An invalid member ID was specified. The valid range is 1 to 32, inclusive.
User response: Specify a member ID between 1 and 32.
System action: The change log inventory utility terminates. Message DSNJ445I is written to the SYSPRINT data set.
Additional actions occur for some error-description values, and are described with the explanation of the value.
User response: Take the action indicated for the error-description value.

DSNJ700I csect_name ERROR ATTEMPTING TO ACCESS BSDS FOR PEER MEMBER ID= member-id, MEMBER NAME= member-name, REASON-CODE= reason-code.
Explanation: DB2 issues this message to identify the peer member ID, and if known, the peer member name
associated with listed DB2 reason code.
System action: An execution unit issues this message and then, if this was an unconditional request, writes a record
to SYS1.LOGREC and requests an SVC dump. The execution unit then terminates.
Operator response: Collect all relevant diagnostic materials, including SYS1.LOGREC, SVC dump, and console
output of peer and host.
System programmer response: Review the explanation for the associated DB2 reason code for further action.
DSNJ701E csect-name MEMBER NAME (membername) IN BSDS DOES NOT MATCH MEMBER NAME (membername) IN DB2 SYSTEM PARAMETERS dsnzparm
Explanation: During startup, DB2 detected that the member name listed in its bootstrap data set (BSDS) does not
match the member name in the DB2 system parameters load module.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Restore the BSDS or specify a different system parameters load module on the
START DB2 command.
DSNJ702E csect_name GENERIC LU NAME lu-name IN BSDS DOES NOT MATCH THE GENERIC LU NAME lu-name ASSOCIATED WITH THE DATA SHARING GROUP.
Explanation: DB2 issues this message during startup when it detects that the generic LU name in the bootstrap data
set (BSDS) does not match the generic LU name in the shared communications area (SCA) structure.
System action: DB2 startup continues.
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Depending on the accuracy of the BSDS value, take one of the following actions:
v BSDS value is correct: DB2 startup will automatically replace the generic LU name in the SCA with the correct
value. The BSDS for each member of this DB2 data sharing group must specify this same value for generic LU
name.If any member specifies a different value for generic LU name, use the change log inventory utility
(DSNJU003) to change the generic LU name.
v BSDS value is not correct: DB2 startup will replace the generic LU name in the SCA. The SCA value will be
incorrect when startup is complete. Take the following actions to correct this situation:
C Stop this DB2 subsystem.
C Use the change log inventory utility (DSNJU003) to change the generic LU name of this member.
C Issue START DB2 for this member. START DB2 will correct the generic LU name contained in the SCA.

DSNJ703E csect-name GROUP NAME (groupname) IN BSDS DOES NOT MATCH GROUP NAME (groupname) IN DB2 SYSTEM PARAMETERS dsnzparm
Explanation: During startup, DB2 detected that the group name listed in its bootstrap data set (BSDS) does not
match the group name in the DB2 system parameters load module.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Restore the BSDS or specify a different system parameters load module on the
START DB2 command.
DSNJ704I csect-name NEW MEMBER(member-name) START-UP NOT ALLOWED WHEN GROUP-RESTART IS REQUIRED FOR GROUP(group-name).
Explanation: One of the following occurred:
v A new member member-name tried to start when a group restart of data sharing group group-name is required.
v A member other than the originating member of a data sharing group attempted to start the new DB2 data sharing
group. The originating member of a group is either an existing DB2 subsystem which formed the data sharing
group or a new DB2 subsystem which was installed to form the group.
System action: The DB2 subsystem stops.
Operator response: Start a previously active member of this group. When the required group restart is completed,
start the new member again.
If this is the very first startup of the group, you must start the originating member first before starting any other
member.
DSNJ705I csect-name THE DB2 SYSTEM PARAMETERS SPECIFY DATA SHARING, BUT THE BSDS SPECIFIES NON-DATA SHARING.
Explanation: The system parameters passed on the DB2 start command specified data sharing, but the bootstrap
data set (BSDS) did not indicate this DB2 is a data sharing member.
System action: The DB2 subsystem stops.
Operator response: If this DB2 should be a member of a data sharing group, inform the system programmer. If this
DB2 is not a member of a data sharing group, restart DB2 with the correct system parameters load module
System programmer response: If this DB2 should be a member of a data sharing group, execute the installation job
DSNTIJUZ, which updates the BSDS for data sharing.
If this DB2 is not a member of a data sharing group, reassemble the system parameters load module and specify
DSHARE=NO.
If this DB2 is attempting to disable the data sharing group, then reassemble the system parameters load module and
specify DSHARE=NO, then execute the installation job DSNTIJGF, and then restart this DB2. Job DSNTIJGF must be
used with caution, this will disable the data sharing group.

Explanation: The system parameters passed on the DB2 START command specified non-data sharing, but the
bootstrap data set (BSDS) indicates this is a data sharing member.
System action: The DB2 subsystem stops.
Operator response: If this DB2 is a member of a data sharing group, restart DB2 with the correct system parameters
load module. If this DB2 is not a member of a data sharing group, inform the system programmer.
System programmer response: If this DB2 should be a member of a data sharing group, reassemble the system
parameters load module and specify DSHARE=YES. If this DB2 is not a member of a data sharing group, execute the
installation job DSNTIJGF, which updates the BSDS for non-data sharing.
DSNJ707E csect_name LOCATION NAME location-name IN BSDS DOES NOT MATCH THE LOCATION NAME location-name ASSOCIATED WITH THE DATA SHARING GROUP.
Explanation: DB2 issues this message during startup when it detects that the LOCATION name in the bootstrap
data set (BSDS) does not match the LOCATION name in the system communications area (SCA) structure.
System action: DB2 startup continues.
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Depending on the accuracy of the BSDS value, take one of the following actions:
v BSDS value is correct: DB2 startup will automatically replace the LOCATION name in the SCA with the correct
value. The BSDS for each member of this DB2 data sharing group must specify this same value for LOCATION. If
any member specifies a different value for LOCATION, use the change log inventory utility (DSNJU003) to change
the LOCATION name.
v BSDS value is not correct: DB2 startup will replace the LOCATION name in the SCA. The SCA value will be
incorrect when startup is complete. Take the following actions to correct this situation:
C Stop this DB2 subsystem.
C If any member specifies a different value for LOCATION, use the change log inventory utility (DSNJU003) to
change the LOCATION name.
C Issue START DB2 for this member. START DB2 will correct the LOCATION name contained in the SCA.

DSNL003I DDF IS STARTING
Explanation: The distributed data facility (DDF) -START command is starting.
System action: DB2 begins processing the -START DDF command.
DSNL004I csect-name DDF START COMPLETE LOCATION location-name LU network-name.luname GENERICLU network-name.generic-luname DOMAIN domain-name TCPPORT incoming-port SECPORT secure-port RESPORT resynch-port IPNAME ip-name OPTIONS: PKGREL = pkgrel-value
Explanation: The distributed data facility (DDF) started.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
location-name
The location of the DB2 subsystem.
network-name.luname
The fully qualified LU name for the DB2 subsystem.
The value '- NONE' indicates that the DB2 subsystem has not activated its SNA/APPC communications
support.
network-name.generic-luname
The fully qualified VTAM generic LU name for the DB2 subsystem.
The value '-NONE' indicates that no VTAM generic LU name was defined to be used by the DB2 subsystem
or that SNA was not activated.
domain-name
For non-data sharing systems, the member-specific domain name that maps to the member-specific IP
address.
For data sharing systems, the group domain name that maps to the group IP address.
The domain name can be specified in the DNS or a local host file.
The value '-NONE' indicates that TCP/IP is not supported, TCP/IP initialization failed, or DB2 has been
started in restricted access mode.
incoming-port
The TCP/IP port number that is used by this DB2 subsystem to accept incoming DRDA? connection
requests.
v A value of 0 indicates that TCP/IP is not supported. The BSDS DDF record is not configured with a
PORT.
v A value of '-NONE' indicates that DB2 will not accept connections on this port. This condition can be
caused by a value of 0 for the MAXDBAT subsystem parameter.
secure-port
The TCP/IP port number that is used by this DB2 subsystem to accept incoming secure DRDA connection
requests.
A value of 0 indicates that the BSDS DDF record is not configured with a SECPORT.
resynch-port
The TCP/IP port number that is used by this DB2 subsystem to accept incoming two-phase commit
resynchronization requests.
A value of 0 indicates that TCP/IP is not supported. The BSDS DDF record is not configured with a
RESPORT.
ip-name The name given to this DB2 subsystem for use as the network ID portion of the unit of work identifier.
v A value of '-NONE' indicates that either the BSDS DDF record does not have a value for IPNAME
v Any other value indicates that DDF has activated TCP/IP communications support in such a way that the
value of network-name.luname will be '-NONE'.
pkgrel-value
The current value of the DDF PKGREL processing option. Possible values are:
BNDOPT
When a connection which has used a high performance DBAT terminates, the high performance
DBAT is also be deallocated.
BNDPOOL
DDF processing is the as BNDOPT, with the following exception. When a connection that was used
for a high performance DBAT terminates, the high performance DBAT is pooled. The pooled DBAT
can then be used by another connection that presents a request to the subsystem.
COMMIT
Packages are always allocated under RELEASE(COMMIT) rules regardless of their package
RELEASE bind option value.
When an access thread has completed a unit of work, and the DBAT can be pooled, DDF pools the
DBAT, makes an accounting record, deletes the current WLM enclave, and inactivates the
connection. Pooled access threads release all package allocation locks.
If the CMTSTAT subsystem parameter is set to ACTIVE, then the message will always indicate that
PKGREL IS SET TO COMMIT, regardless of the value specified on the command.
System action: The DDF start up process completed. However, it might fail for reasons specified by messages DSNL013I, DSNL015I, DSNL016I, DSNL017I, DSNL018I, DSNL019I, DSNL700I, or DSNL705I.
System programmer response: Use the recommended domain name to configure network definitions for TCP/IP
requesters.

DSNL010I DDF THREAD luw-id HAS BEEN CANCELED
Explanation: The distributed data facility (DDF) thread with the specified logical unit of work ID was canceled.
luw-id The logical unit of work ID.
If the logical unit of work ID is an LU network name and an LUW instance number instead of an LUWID token, in
rare circumstances more than one DDF thread might be canceled. This situation only arises when an application
accesses the same DB2 server by different access paths (for example, A->B->C and A->D->C). In such a case, multiple
threads with the same LUWID exist at the server (for example, C). If CANCEL DDF THREAD is issued at the server,
specifying this LUWID, every thread at the server with the LUWID is canceled.
System action: The specified thread is canceled.

copy.
Problem determination: Refer to the appropriate VSAM publications.
DSNL019I VTAM DOES NOT SUPPORT APPC FUNCTIONS
Explanation: The installed release of VTAM does not support the advanced program-to-program communications
(APPC) application program interface (API). The APPC API bit is not set in the VTAM function-list vector in the
access-method-support vector list.
System action: Termination of the distributed data facility (DDF) is initiated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Determine whether the installed release of VTAM supports the APPC API. If VTAM
does not support the APPC API, a VTAM release that supports the APPC API must be installed before the DDF can
be started.
DSNL020I KEYWORD 'THREAD' PARAMETER 'parameter' FORMAT IN ERROR
Explanation: The parameter value specified for the logical unit of work ID on the CANCEL DDF THREAD has an
invalid format.
parameter
The invalid parameter string.
The correct format for the parameter is either network-id.luname.luwunique or luname.luwunique, using the following
values:
network-id
An optional 1- to 8-character network ID.
luname A 1- to 8-character logical unit name.
luwunique
A 12-character hexadecimal number.
System action: The specified thread is not canceled.
User response: Determine the correct logical unit of work ID of the distributed thread that is to be canceled and
reissue the command.
Problem determination: Use the -DISPLAY THREAD command to display all distributed activity.
DSNL021I command ACCEPTED
Explanation: The 'command' command has been accepted and asynchronous processing of 'command' has been
initiated. The command can only be -START or -STOP the distributed data facility.
System action: The command was accepted and asynchronous processing has been initiated.
DSNL022I csect-name DDF THREAD 'luw-id' WAS PREVIOUSLY CANCELED
Explanation: A command to cancel the distributed data facility (DDF) thread luw-id was issued, but a command to
cancel the same thread has already been issued.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
luw-id The logical unit of work ID.
Either the CANCEL DDF THREAD or the CANCEL THREAD command was entered.
System action: The thread is currently being canceled.
User response: No action is required.
Programmer response: The CANCEL command terminates a thread only if the thread is processing in DB2 or is
currently suspended by DB2. The thread might not be processing in DB2 in these situations:
v The thread is processing in the application and has not made a request to DB2. The DISPLAY THREAD command
indicates this.
v The user placed the thread on an MVS resource using the ENQUE command. The CANCEL command has no
effect on the thread until ENQUE completes and the thread returns to DB2.
v The thread is processing in VTAM and is waiting for a response from a partner. The DISPLAY THREAD DETAIL
command indicates this. In this case the thread does not terminate until VTAM returns to DB2. VTAM commands,
which will terminate the session or LU, can be used to cause VTAM to return to DB2.
DSNL023I DDF IS ALREADY IN THE PROCESS OF STARTING
Explanation: The distributed data facility (DDF) was starting when the -START DDF or -STOP DDF command was
issued.
System action: The issued command is not executed.
DSNL024I DDF IS ALREADY IN THE PROCESS OF STOPPING
Explanation: The distributed data facility (DDF) was stopping when the -STOP DDF or -START DDF command was
issued.

suspected, acquire documentation to diagnose the problem.
1. Console dump of DB2 address spaces (ssnmDBM1, ssnmMSTR, ssnmDIST), VTAM, and user's address space at the
requesting site.
2. Console dump of DB2 address spaces (ssnmDBM1, ssnmMSTR, ssnmDIST), and VTAM at the server site.
3. SYSLOG from requesting and server sites.
4. LOGREC from requesting and server sites.
If an indefinite inconsistency is suspected, use the CANCEL DDF THREAD command to terminate the thread. If
CANCEL DDF THREAD fails to terminate the agent, use VTAM commands to terminate the thread conversations.
Problem determination: Use the DB2 DISPLAY THREAD command with DETAIL option at each DB2 subsystem to
display information about the agent and its conversations. Use VTAM commands to display additional information
about the conversations being used by the thread and also about network conditions.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v SVC dump (or system dump), taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, as result of an operator-initiated dump command
or SLIP trap exit.

REQUESTING
The thread is an allied thread that has distributed activity.
SERVER
The thread is a database access thread.
luw-id=token
The logical unit of work identifier (LUWID) and a five-digit token value. The token value can be used in any
DB2 command that accepts a LUWID as input.
thread-information
Information about the thread. The information is presented in a colon-delimited list that contains the
following segments:
v The primary authorization ID that is associated with the thread.
v The name of the user's workstation.
v The ID of the user.
v The name of the application.
v The statement type for the previously executed statement: dynamic or static.
v The statement identifier for the previously executed statement, if available. The statement identifier can be
used to identify the particular SQL statement. For static statements, the statement identifier correlates to
the STMT_ID column in the SYSIBM.SYSPACKSTMT table. For dynamic statements, the statement
identifier correlates to the STMT_ID column in the DSN_STATEMENT_CACHE_TABLE table. That
statement might not have contributed to the current failure.
v The name of the role that is associated with the thread.
v The correlation token that can be used to correlate work at the remote system with work performed at the
DB2 subsystem. The correlation token, if available, is enclosed in '<' and '>' characters, and contains three
components, separated by periods:
C A 3 to 39 character IP address.
C A 1 to 8 character port address.
C A 12 character unique identifier.
An asterisk (*) in any segment indicates that the information is not available.
abend-code
The abend code. A value of zeros indicates that the abend code could not be determined.
reason-code
A numeric value that indicates the reason for the failure. A value of zeros indicates that the reason code
could not be determined.
This message might be followed by instances of message DSNL028I, each of which describes a remote location where
the distributed agent also exists and where diagnostic information might also need to be collected.
Problem determination: Use the information provided for the abend-code value to determine what diagnostic
information to gather.
Look for instances of message DSNL028I that identify other locations that are involved in the abend.

A numeric value that describes the nature of the DDF processing failure.
thread-information
Information about the thread. The information is presented in a colon-delimited list that contains the
following segments:
v The primary authorization ID that is associated with the thread.
v The name of the user's workstation.
v The ID of the user.
v The name of the application.
v The statement type for the previously executed statement: dynamic or static.
v The statement identifier for the previously executed statement, if available. The statement identifier can be
used to identify the particular SQL statement. For static statements, the statement identifier correlates to
the STMT_ID column in the SYSIBM.SYSPACKSTMT table. For dynamic statements, the statement
identifier correlates to the STMT_ID column in the DSN_STATEMENT_CACHE_TABLE table. That
statement might not have contributed to the current failure.
v The name of the role that is associated with the thread.
v The correlation token that can be used to correlate work at the remote system with work performed at the
DB2 subsystem. The correlation token, if available, is enclosed in '<' and '>' characters, and contains three
components, separated by periods:
C A 3 to 39 character IP address.
C A 1 to 8 character port address.
C A 12 character unique identifier.
An asterisk (*) in any segment indicates that the information is not available.
System action: Processing continues, but the system will eventually abend the database access agent.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer for analysis.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
DSNL031I csect-name DRDA EXCEPTION CONDITION IN RESPONSE FROM SERVER LOCATION=locationindicator FOR THREAD WITH LUWID=luwid REASON=reason-code ERROR ID=error-id CORRELATION ID=correlation-id CONNECTION ID=connection-id IFCID=ifcid SEE TRACE RECORD WITH IFCID SEQUENCE NUMBER=seq-no
Explanation: A DRDA exception condition was detected in response data returned from the application server (AS).

be used to determine what caused the DRDA exception condition, and is written to the destination for
IFCID 191. The message and the trace record are written only the first time an error is detected. This avoids
flooding the console and the trace. The sequence number is printed in hexadecimal.
If the sequence number is zero, then the trace data was not externalized.
System action: An alert was generated. Additionally, if the seq-no is not zero, the system wrote a trace record with
IFCID=ifcid-name to the destination for IFCID 191 that can be used to diagnose the problem.
Problem determination: Determine the destination of the trace record and locate and print the trace record with
SEQUENCE NUMBER=sequence-number. The description of the reason code can be used in conjunction with the
publication Distributed Relational Database Architecture? Reference to determine the type of DRDA exception that
has been detected. Determine the problem and which system is responsible by using the procedures that are

DSNL033I csect-name DDF TERMINATION SCHEDULED DUE TO DETECTION OF ABEND abend REASON reason
Explanation: A severe error was detected during DDF processing. DDF processing can no longer continue so DDF
termination has been scheduled. 'Csect-name' is the DB2 module that detected the condition and requested DDF
termination.
The abend and reason might also contain additional information about the cause.
abend The abend code or zeros if no abend is associated with the termination of DDF.
If the abend was a DB2 04E abend, the DB2 reason code will contain additional information about the
abend.
reason The DB2 reason code or zeros if no DB2 reason code is associated with the termination of DDF.
If no abend is associated with the problem, the reason code describes the cause for the termination.
System action: Termination of the distributed data facility (DDF) is initiated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer for analysis.
System programmer response: Determine the cause of the failure. Correct the condition and restart DDF using the
-START DDF command.
Problem determination: If an abend is associated with the failure, a dump might have been provided. LOGREC will
also contain information about the abend.
DSNL034E DDF CANNOT BE STARTED BECAUSE OF BSDS INCONSISTENCIES, ORIGINAL LUNAME=original-luname, BSDS LUNAME=bsds-luname, ORIGINAL LOCATION=original-location, BSDS LOCATION=bsds-location
Explanation: The LUNAME or the LOCATION name stored in the bootstrap data set (BSDS) was changed after the
distributed data facility (DDF) was last started, but DDF still has resynchronization responsibility with one or more
partner logical units using the old LUNAME and LOCATION name. Both the original and current BSDS values of
LUNAME and LOCATION name are displayed.
original-luname
The LUNAME required for resynchronization.
bsds-luname
The LUNAME currently stored in the BSDS.
original-location
The LOCATION name required for resynchronization.
bsds-location
The LOCATION name currently stored in the BSDS.
System action: DDF cannot be started until the inconsistencies are corrected.
Operator response: Inform the database administrator.
Database administrator response: Take the appropriate action, depending on whether there is a requirement to
change the LUNAME or LOCATION name in the BSDS:
Name changed in error
Use the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility to change the LUNAME, LOCATION name , or both back
to the correct value. Then issue the START DDF command.
Name change required
Remove all of the resynchronization responsibility that DB2 had using the old names. You can purge this
information, allow automatic resynchronization to take place, or use a combination of both.
You can purge resynchronization information by using the RESET INDOUBT command with the FORCE
option. You can purge all information regardless of partner name (LOCATION (*)), or you can selectively
purge by specifying a location name. DDF does not have to be started to use this command. You can use the
DISPLAY THREAD command to generate a report of indoubt threads. This report indicates all
resynchronization responsibility known by DB2.
If you do not purge the resynchronization information, or choose to selectively purge, and you want
automatic resynchronization to occur before changing the names, you must first use the change log
inventory (DSNJU003) utility to change the LUNAME, the LOCATION name, or both back to the correct
value. Then issue the START DDF. At this point, automatic resynchronization begins. You can monitor the
progress by periodically using the DISPLAY THREAD command for TYPE (INDOUBT) threads.
Resynchronization does not complete until all needed communications paths are available and all needed
partner logical units are available. If you cannot wait for availability, use the RESET INDOUBT command
with the FORCE option to purge information associated with unavailable partners.

DSNL035I DDF CANNOT BE STOPPED BECAUSE AN INDOUBT DATA BASE ACCESS THREAD EXISTS
Explanation: DDF is the connection manager for a database access thread (DBAT) that is indoubt. A STOP DDF
MODE(QUIESCE) command is rejected until the indoubt logical unit of work is resolved.
System action: DDF is not stopped.
Operator response: Inform the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: You have the following options:
v Wait for automatic resynchronization to be performed. When this occurs, either message DSNL407I or DSNL415I is
displayed.
After the indoubt thread is resolved, reissue the STOP DDF command.
v Use the DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT) command to find the LOCATION that has coordinator responsibility
for the indoubt LUW. Contact that location and determine whether the LUW committed or aborted. Then use the
RECOVER INDOUBT command to cause the indoubt DBAT to be resolved with the same decision.
After the indoubt thread is resolved, reissue the STOP DDF command.
v Issue the STOP DDF MODE(FORCE) command. The indoubt thread remains indoubt and can be resolved by using
automatic resynchronization after DDF is started again, or it can be resolved manually as described above.
DSNL036I DDF THREAD logical-unit-of-work-id SPECIFIED IS INDOUBT
Explanation: A database access thread that is indoubt cannot be canceled by using the -CANCEL DDF THREAD
command.
System action: The specified thread is not canceled.
Operator response: Use the -DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(*) command to display all distributed activity.
DSNL037I csect-name RESET GENERICLU lu SUCCESSFUL
Explanation: The RESET GENERICLU command successfully purged the VTAM sysplex information from shared
memory.
lu The value supplied on the RESET GENERICLU command
System action: The VTAM information contained in the sysplex shared memory for the indicated LU is purged.
DSNL038E csect-name RESET GENERICLU lu FAILED DUE TO VTAM RTNCD=xx and FDB2=yy
Explanation: The VTAM CHANGE,OPTCD=(SYN,ENDAFFIN) macro returned an unexpected return code, which is
described by the indicated VTAM RTNCD and FDB2 values.
lu The value supplied on the RESET GENERICLU command
xx The hexadecimal value of the VTAM RTNCD field
yy The hexadecimal value of the VTAM FDB2 field
System action: VTAM was not able to purge the sysplex shared memory information for the indicated LU.
System programmer response: Refer to z/OS Communications Server SNA Programming for the meaning of the VTAM
RTNCD and FDB2 values.
DSNL039E csect-name RESET GENERICLU lu FAILED DUE TO ACTIVE VTAM SESSIONS
Explanation: The RESET GENERICLU command was not accepted because one or more active VTAM sessions exist
to the indicated LU. All VTAM sessions must be terminated before the command is accepted.
lu The value supplied on the RESET GENERICLU command
System action: The command is rejected.
System programmer response: Terminate the VTAM sessions to the remote LU and reissue the -RESET
GENERICLU command.
DSNL040E csect-name RESET GENERICLU lu FAILED DUE TO INDOUBT RESOLUTION INFORMATION
Explanation: The RESET GENERICLU command was not accepted because information is currently being retained
for resolution of indoubt threads for the indicated partner LU. The DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT) command
can be used to view this information.
lu The value supplied on the RESET GENERICLU command
System action: The command is rejected.
System programmer response: Make sure that all indoubt threads at the remote site are resolved before issuing the
RESET GENERICLU command.
When DB2 performs automatic indoubt thread resolution, the information contained in the DISPLAY THREAD
TYPE(INDOUBT) display is purged at the end of the resynchronization process.
If required, use the -RESET INDOUBT command to manually purge the indoubt resolution information.
DSNL041E csect-name DB2 GENERIC LU NAME REQUESTED, BUT REQUIRED VTAM LEVEL IS NOT INSTALLED
Explanation: The DB2 GENERIC LUNAME installation option was specified. This option requires VTAM Version 4
Release 2 or a later release.
System action: The DB2 GENERIC LUNAME installation option is ignored.
System programmer response: If the DB2 GENERIC LUNAME is required, install VTAM Version 4 Release 2 or a
later release.
DSNL042E csect-name DB2 SYSPLEX TP WAS INVOKED BY LU lu, BUT REQUIRED MVS LEVEL IS NOT INSTALLED
Explanation: A request for the DB2 sysplex transaction program (TP) was received by a DB2 server that is a
member of a data sharing group. The DB2 sysplex TP is used by the requesting systems to determine which DB2
systems within the group are currently available for DDF conversations.
The DB2 sysplex TP uses Workload Manager (WLM) functions in MVS Version 5 Release 2 or a later release to
balance distributed workload among the DB2 systems in the group. Because the required MVS release is not installed
or DB2 is not registered with WLM, the DB2 sysplex TP is not able to provide the requested information.
lu The name of the LU in the network that invoked the DB2 sysplex TP
System action: The DB2 sysplex TP returns the NETID.LUNAME of the local DB2 system as the only available DB2
server in the group. The requester is not provided the names of other DB2 systems in the group, so all sessions from
the requester are routed to the local DB2 server.
System programmer response: Install MVS Version 5 Release 2 or a later release if you want to have the DB2
sysplex TP return multiple NETID.LUNAME values to the requester or refer to the DSNL044I on why DB2 could not
register with WLM.
DSNL043I csect-name RESET GENERICLU 'luname' INVALID
Explanation: The luname value specified is invalid.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
luname The logical unit name.
The correct format for the logical unit name is either luname or network-id.luname, using the following values:
network-id
An optional 1- to 8-character network ID.
luname A 1- to 8-character logical unit name.
System action: The parameter is ignored. Processing continues with the next logical unit name, if any.
User response: Determine the correct value for luname and reissue the command.
DSNL044I csect-name MVS macro-name MACRO FAILED WITH RETCODE='return-code'X AND RSNCODE='reason-code'X
Explanation: An MVS Workload Manager (WLM) macro returned an unexpected return code, which is described by
the indicated RETCODE and RSNCODE values. DDF uses MVS Workload Manager macros to obtain data sharing
sysplex routing information for incoming DDF work requests, and to establish an MVS enclave for the execution
environment of the distributed thread.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
macro-name
The name of the MVS macro that returned the unexpected return code. The possible values are:
v IWMSRSRG: Register with WLM for sysplex routing.
v IWMSRSRS: Request sysplex routing information.
v IWMSRDRS: Deregister with WLM for sysplex routing.
v IWMECREA: Create enclave.
v IWMEQRP: Query enclave
The WLM sysplex routing service macros will be appended with the contents of the LOCATION parameter
passed to it. The contents of the LOCATION parameter will either be the member's location name or one of
the alias-names being defined to subset the data sharing group. If the member's location name is displayed,
then this member will not participate in WLM workload balancing. If a subsetting alias-name is displayed,
then subsetting of the data sharing group by that alias-name will be disabled. However, a connection to this
member of the data sharing group will be accepted when using the alias-name instead of the member's
location name.
return-code
The hexadecimal value of the MVS return code.
reason-code
The hexadecimal value of the MVS reason code.
System action: If a sysplex routing macro failed, then sysplex routing may not be performed in which case, all SQL
statements received from the client will be processed by this DB2 subsystem. If an enclave macro failed, the
distributed thread may not be able to execute in an MVS enclave, however the distributed thread will continue to
execute as an MVS SRB.
System programmer response: Use the MVS return and reason codes to determine the problem.

DSNL045I csect-name ICSF function-name FUNCTION FAILED WITH RETCODE='return-code'X AND RSNCODE='reason-code'X
Explanation: DB2 for z/OS made an Integrated Cryptographic Service Facility (ICSF) call because a connection to a
remote server or a connection from a remote requester is using encryption. DB2 for z/OS uses ICSF to perform the
following functions:
v Creating connection keys
v Generating a shared private key
v Encrypting data
v Decrypting data
The ICSF call returned an unexpected return code.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.

v CSNESYD: Symmetric Decipher
v CSNEOWH: MD5 Hash
return-code
The hexadecimal value of the ICSF return code.
reason-code
The hexadecimal value of the ICSF reason code.
System action: The encryption function cannot be processed. If ICSF services were successfully loaded during DB2
startup processing, DB2 retries the ICSF services call periodically. Each time that the call fails, DB2 issue this message.
If ICSF services were not successfully loaded, DB2 does not retry the ICSF services call.
System programmer response: If the encryption facility is not installed, install it before requesting encryption. If the
encryption facility is installed, verify that it is working correctly. Look up the return code and reason code in the
ICSF documentation for help in finding and fixing the problem.

DSNL074I NUMBER OF CLIENT CONNECTIONS HAS EXCEEDED exceeded-percent % OF THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED
Explanation: The number of increasing client connections has exceeded either 80% or 90% relative of the value of
the CONDBAT subsystem parameter.
percent-exceeded
The percentage of the threshold specified by the value of the CONDBAT subsystem parameter that was
exceeded.
The DSNL074I message is issued only when the DB2 subsystem is a member of a data sharing group.
System action: The health value reported to WLM is decreased to 50% (when the value of exceeded-percent is 80) or
25% (when the value of exceeded-percent is 90) of the calculated DB2 system health value. This action might enable
remote client systems to direct work to other members which have more resources to process the work.
The modified health value remains until the number of client connections decreases below either the 80% or 90%
threshold.
System programmer response: If a subsequent DSNL075I is displayed, no action is required.
Otherwise, investigate why the number of connections has exceeded the threshold set by the CONDBAT subsystem
parameter. You can use the DISPLAY LOCATION command to determine which client locations are sending
increasing numbers of connections to the DB2 subsystem. If the cause of the increasing connections in normal
workload growth, then additional monitoring might be required. If the increasing connections are the result of and
exception condition, additional investigation might be required to resolve the problem.

v The LOCATION option in the DDF statement of the DSNJU003 (change log inventory) utility
luname The DDF LU name, as recorded in the BSDS. The LU name can be specified by one of the following
methods:
v The DB2 NETWORK LUNAME field on the DSNTIPR installation panel
v The LUNAME option in the DDF statement of the DSNJU003 (change log inventory) utility
A value of -NONE indicates one of the following situations:
v An LU name is not configured.
v The DDF record in the BSDS already has a value for IPNAME. Therefore, DDF did not activate its
Systems Network Architecture (SNA) or Advanced Program to Program Communication (APPC) support.
If an LU name is configured, the luname field contains the fully qualified LU name, which consists of a
network ID, a period delimiter, and the LU name. The network ID is determined from VTAM after DDF is
started. A network ID of NONE indicates that DDF is not yet started, or initialization with VTAM failed.
genericlu
The DDF generic LU name, as recorded in the BSDS. The generic LU name can be specified by one of the
following methods:
v The DB2 GENERIC LUNAME field on the DSNTIPR installation panel
v The GENERIC option in the DDF statement of the DSNJU003 (change log inventory) utility
A value of -NONE indicates one of the following situations:
v A generic LU name is not configured.
v The DDF record in the BSDS already has a value for IPNAME. Therefore, DDF did not activate its
Systems Network Architecture (SNA) or Advanced Program to Program Communication (APPC) support.
If a generic LU name is configured and enabled, the genericlu field contains the fully qualified generic LU
name, which consists of a network ID, a period delimiter, and the generic LU name. The network ID is
determined from VTAM after DDF is started. A network ID of NONE indicates that the DDF is not yet
started, or initialization with VTAM failed.
The location name, LU name, and generic LU name for DDF are also included in message DSNL004I when DDF is
started.

 DSNL084I: TCP/IP port information:
The location information is followed by information about the TCP/IP port that is associated with DDF:
 DSNL084I TCPPORT=tcp-port SECPORT=secure-port RESPORT=resync-port IPNAME=ip-name
tcp-port The TCP/IP port number for the SQL listener, as recorded in the BSDS. This port number can be specified
by one of the following methods:
v The DRDA PORT field on the DSNTIP5 installation panel
v The PORT option in the DDF statement of the DSNJU003 (change log inventory) utility
A value of 0 (zero) indicates that an SQL listener port was not specified, and DDF is not configured to use
TCP/IP network protocols.
A value of -NONE indicates that DB2 does not accept connections on this port. One possible reason that
DB2 does not accept connections is that the MAXDBAT subsystem parameter is set to 0 (zero). The current
MAXDBAT value is listed in the DSNL090I message, which is included as part of the DISPLAY DDF output
when the DETAIL option is specified.
secure-port
The TCP/IP port number for the secure SQL listener, as recorded in the BSDS. This port number can be
specified by one of the following methods:
v The SECURE PORT field on the DSNTIP5 installation panel
v The SECPORT option in the DDF statement of the DSNJU003 (change log inventory) utility
A value of 0 (zero) indicates both of the following conditions:
v A secure SQL listener port was not specified.
v DDF is not configured to accept secure inbound connections by using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
protocol through this port number.
If a secure port is not specified, remote connections can still use the TCP/IP port for the SQL listener
(tcp-port) and use the SSL protocol on that port. However, DDF does not validate whether the connection
uses SSL protocol.
A value of -NONE indicates that DB2 does not accept connections on this port. One possible reason that
DB2 does not accept connections is that the MAXDBAT subsystem parameter is set to 0 (zero). The current
MAXDBAT value is listed in the DSNL090I message, which is included as part of the DISPLAY DDF output
when the DETAIL option is specified.
resync-port
The TCP/IP port number for the two-phase commit resynchronization (resync) listener, as recorded in the
BSDS. This port number can be specified by one of the following methods:
v The RESYNC PORT field on the DSNTIP5 installation panel
v The RESPORT option in the DDF statement of the DSNJU003 (change log inventory) utility
A value of 0 (zero) indicates that a resynchronization listener port was not specified, and DDF is not
configured to use TCP/IP network protocols.
ip-name The IPNAME value, as recorded in the BSDS. For a description of the IPNAME value, see the DSNJU003
syntax information.
This value is unique to this DDF.
If this DB2 subsystem is a member of a data sharing group, the IPNAME value is unique to that data
sharing group. If all the members of a data sharing group activate only their TCP/IP communications
support, all members of that group must be defined with the same IPNAME value.
This TCP/IP port information for DDF is also included in message DSNL004I, which is displayed when DDF is
started.

 DSNL085I: IP address:
The TCP/IP port information is followed by the IP address that is associated with DDF:
 DSNL085I IPADDR=ip-address
ip-address
The IP address of DDF.
If the subsystem is a member of a data-sharing group, the IP address is a sysplex-wide IP address. DB2
expects this sysplex-wide IP address to be configured as a distributed dynamic virtual IP address
(distributed DVIPA). A distributed DVIPA distributes connections across the group.
A value of -NONE indicates that one or more of the following conditions is true:
v DDF is not configured to use TCP/IP network protocols. See the tcp-port value in message DSNL084I.
v DDF is not started.
v TCP/IP initialization failed.
If both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are configured, message DSNL085I is displayed twice, once for each
protocol type.
If the subsystem is not a member of a data sharing group and the listener ports are defined, DDF obtains its
IP address from one of the following places:
v The IP address that is recorded in the BSDS
v The information that is returned by a z/OS UNIX System Services getaddrinfo call
If the subsystem is a member of a data sharing group and the listener ports are defined, DDF obtains the
location's sysplex-wide IP address from one of the following places:
v The IP address that is recorded in the BSDS
v The IP address that is bound in the TCP/IP PORT definition statement for the DRDA SQL port
If the IP address is recorded in the BSDS, DDF accepts connections on any address. Otherwise, DDF accepts
connections on only the IP addresses that are displayed in messages DSNL085I and DSNL089I.

 DSNL086I: TCP/IP domain name:
The IP address is followed by the TCP/IP domain name that is associated with DDF:
 DSNL086I domain-type DOMAIN=domain-name
domain-type
The type of domain name that is displayed, which can be one of the following values:
SQL The name that is used by TCP/IP to route requests to the location. The name is associated with the
IP address that is displayed in message DSNL085I.
RESYNC
The name that is used by TCP/IP to route requests to DDF. This information is displayed only if
DDF is a member of a DB2 data sharing group. This name is associated with the IP address that is
displayed in message DSNL089I.
domain-name
The domain name that is associated with the domain type. A value of -NONE indicates that TCP/IP is not
configured or that TCP/IP initialization failed.
This domain information is also included in messages DSNL519I and DSNL004I.

 DSNL087I and DSNL088I: Aliases:
If aliases were defined for the DDF location by using the MODIFY DDF command or by using the DSNJU003
(change log inventory) utility, the output includes alias information:
 DSNL087I ALIAS PORT SECPORT STATUS
 DSNL088I alias port secure-port status
alias An alias name.
You can manage static aliases by using the DSNJU003 (change log inventory) utility. You can manage
dynamic aliases by using the MODIFY DDF command and specifying the ALIAS option.
port The TCP/IP port that is associated with the alias. A value of blanks indicates that a port was not specified
for the alias. However, the alias can still be accessed by using other active DRDA SQL ports.
This value is ignored for statically defined location aliases in non-data-sharing environments.
secure-port
The TCP/IP secure port that is associated with the alias. A value of blanks indicates that a secure port was
not specified for the alias. However, the alias can still be accessed by using other active DRDA secure SQL
ports.
This value is ignored for statically defined location aliases in non-data-sharing environments.
status The operational status of the alias, which can be one the following values:
STARTG
The alias is starting. The MODIFY DDF command was issued with the ALIAS keyword to start the
alias, and the start operation is in progress.
STARTD
The alias is started or ready to start with the alias port. DB2 might be processing existing
connections to the alias and is accepting new connection requests to the alias by using the alias
port. Otherwise, DB2 starts accepting new connection requests to the alias by using the alias port
when the following conditions become true:
v DDF is started.
v The MAXDBAT subsystem parameter is set to a value greater than 0.
STOPG
The alias is stopping. The MODIFY DDF command with the ALIAS keyword was issued to stop an
alias, and the stop operation is in progress.
STOPD
The alias is stopped. DB2 does not accept new connection requests to the alias by using the alias
port. However, DB2 can still accept requests to the alias by using the group SQL port if DDF is
active and listening on it. This value applies to only those aliases that are defined and managed
dynamically by the MODIFY DDF command with the ALIAS keyword.
CANCLG
The alias is canceling. The MODIFY DDF command with the ALIAS keyword was issued to cancel
an alias, and the cancel operation is in progress.
CANCLD
The alias is canceled. DB2 canceled all existing database access threads (DBATs) that were
processing connections to the alias. DB2 does not accept new connection requests to the alias by
using the alias port. However, DB2 can still accept requests to the alias by using the group SQL
port if DDF is active and listening on it. This value applies to only those aliases that are defined
and managed dynamically by the MODIFY DDF command with the ALIAS keyword.
STATIC
The alias is static. DB2 accepts new connection requests when DB2 is available to accept TCP/IP
connection requests. This option applies to only those aliases that were created by the DSNJU003
utility. Such aliases cannot be defined or managed dynamically by the MODIFY DDF command.

 DSNL089I: Member IP address:
If DDF is part of a data sharing group and all of the following conditions are true, the member IP address is
displayed:
v DDF is configured to use TCP/IP network protocols. See the tcp-port value in message DSNL084I.
v DDF is started.
v TCP/IP initialization was successful.
 DSNL089I MEMBER IPADDR= ip-address
ip-address
The IP address that is associated with the specific member of the group or with a specific location alias that
represents a member or subset of members. This value is the IP address that is returned to a client in the
server list for the purposes of workload balancing.
If both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are configured, message DSNL089I is displayed twice, once for each protocol type.
DDF obtains its member IP address from one of the following places:
v The IP address that is specified on the TCP/IP PORT statement by using the BIND keyword
v The IP address that is recorded in the BSDS
v The information that is returned by a z/OS UNIX System Services getaddrinfo call

 DSNL090I: Subsystem parameter information (CMTSTAT, CONDBAT, and MAXDBAT):
If the DETAIL option was specified on the DISPLAY DDF command, the output also includes subsystem parameter
information that is associated with DDF:
 DSNL090I DT=dt CONDBAT= condbat MDBAT= mdbat
dt The DDF thread value. This value corresponds to the CMTSTAT subsystem parameter. dt can have one of
the following values:
A DDF is configured with DDF THREADS ACTIVE.
I DDF is configured with DDF THREADS INACTIVE.
condbat The maximum number of inbound connections. This value corresponds to the CONDBAT subsystem
parameter.
mdbat The maximum number of database access threads (DBATs). This value corresponds to the MAXDBAT
subsystem parameter.
This value determines the maximum number of active slots, which means the maximum number of
concurrent active DBATs that can potentially execute SQL.

 DSNL091I: Subsystem parameter information (MAXCONQN and MAXCONQW):
If the DETAIL option was specified on the DISPLAY DDF command, the output also includes subsystem parameter
information that is associated with DDF:
 DSNL091I MCONQN=maxconqn-value MCONQW=maxconqw-value
maxconqn-value
The depth of the queue of connections that are waiting for a DBAT to process the next request. When this
value is reached, and the threshold that is specified by the MAXDBAT subsystem parameter is also reached,
DB2 closes the oldest waiting client connection.
This value corresponds to the MAXCONQN subsystem parameter.
maxconqw-value
The maximum amount of time that a client connection waits for a thread to process its request. DB2
attempts to close any connection that waits longer than this value.
This value corresponds to the MAXCONQW subsystem parameter.
Related information:
Subsystem parameters that are not on installation panels (DB2 Installation and Migration)
MAX REMOTE ACTIVE field (MAXDBAT subsystem parameter) (DB2 Installation and Migration)
 DSNL092I and DSNL093I: DBAT and connection information:
If the DETAIL option was specified on the DISPLAY DDF command, the output also includes the following
information:
v The number of active, inactive, queued, and disconnected database access threads (DBATs)
v The number of queued and inactive connections
 DSNL092I ADBAT=adbat QUEDBAT=quedbat INADBAT=inadbat CONQUED=conqued
 DSNL093I DSCDBAT=dscdbat INACONN=inaconn
adbat The current number of DBATs. This number includes DBATs that are actively associated with work for
remote connections and disconnected DBATs.
This value increases as new DBATs are created or when inactive DBATs become active. This value decreases
as DBATs terminate or become inactive or as disconnected DBATs terminate. When this value reaches or
exceeds the MAXDBAT value, newly attached connections or new work on existing inactive connections or
threads might be queued. This queueing occurs if no disconnected DBATs are available to service the work.
The MAXDBAT value is shown in message DSNL090I.
quedbat
The cumulative number of the following new work items that had to wait for a DBAT to become available:
v Newly attached connections
v New work on inactive connections
v New work on inactive DBATs
This value is a cumulative counter that is incremented when the MAXDBAT limit is reached. (This value
corresponds to the QDSTQDBT field in IFCID 1.) The quedbat counter is reset only when this DB2 subsystem
is restarted.
A non-zero value suggests that performance and throughput might be affected. If so, consider increasing the
MAXDBAT value.
The MAXDBAT value is shown in message DSNL090I.
inadbat The current number of inactive DBATs (which were previously called type 1 inactive threads). This value
applies only if the dt value in message DSNL090I indicates that DDF INACTIVE support is enabled.
For more information about any DBATs that are included in this number, look at the output from the
DISPLAY THREAD command with the TYPE(INACTIVE) option. The DISPLAY THREAD output begins
with message DSNV401I.
conqued
The current number of connection requests that are queued and are waiting to be serviced. This value
applies only if the dt value in message DSNL090I indicates that DDF INACTIVE support is enabled.
These connections can be newly attached connections or inactive connections for which a new request
arrived from the client. The number of inactive connections is shown in message DSNL093I.
These requests cannot be processed when one of the following conditions occur:
v The maximum number of DBATs is reached, and no disconnected DBATs exist to process the request.
The maximum number of threads is reached when the adbat value is equal to or greater than MAXDBAT
value. (The MAXDBAT value is shown in message DSNL090I.) When this situation occurs, processing
continues for these queued connections when another active DBAT releases its slot either by terminating
or by moving to the inactive state.
v DDF is suspended or suspending. See the status value in message DSNL081I. Processing continues when
DDF is started.
dscdbat The current number of disconnected DBATs. This value applies only if the dt value in message DSNL090I
indicates that DDF INACTIVE support is enabled.
This value indicates the number of DBAT pool threads. DBAT pool threads are the database access threads
that are available to service queued connections requests. The DBATs that are included in this number are
also accounted for in the adbat value.
Over time, disconnected DBATs can hold allocation duration locks. An allocation duration lock is a lock that
persists across commit boundaries. This type of lock requires the connection to be deallocated or the thread
to be enabled if it is inactive. You can release these allocation duration locks by terminating these DBATs.
You can terminate disconnected DBATs by using one of the following methods:
v Issue the STOP DDF command with the MODE(SUSPEND) option. Stopping DDF with
MODE(SUSPEND) terminates these disconnected DBATs without affecting current or new connections.
However, activity on these current or new connections is not processed until DDF is started.
v Change the value of the POOLINAC subsystem parameter. This parameter controls the length of time
after which unused disconnected DBATs are to be automatically terminated.
inaconn
The current number of inactive connections (which were previously called type 2 connections). This value
applies only if the dt value in message DSNL090I indicates that DDF INACTIVE support is enabled.
This value represents connections with clients where the client last ended a unit of work either by a commit
or rollback operation. This operation caused DB2 to change the state of the connection to inactive, which
means that the DBAT is separated from the connection. The connection becomes inactive while the DBAT is
made available to service new client connections or to service new requests on existing client connections.
This value is not included in the inadbat value. When a new request arrives from the client system on the
connection, the connection is then moved to the conqued value.
For more information about any connections that are included in this number, look at the output from the
DISPLAY THREAD command with the TYPE(INACTIVE) option. The DISPLAY THREAD output begins
with message DSNV401I.

 DSNL094I: Closed client connections:
The output also includes information about connections that were closed if both of the following conditions are true:
v The DETAIL option was specified on the DISPLAY DDF command
v The DB2 subsystem is a member of a data sharing group
 DSNL094I WLMHEALTH=health-value CLSDCONQN=number-closed CLSDCONQW=wait-closed
health-value
The health indicator value that was last reported to WLM for the DB2 subsystem. This value is a number
from 0 to 100.
number-closed
The number of client connections that were closed because the value of the MAXCONQN subsystem
parameter was reached since DDF was last started.
wait-closed
The number of client connections that were closed because the value of the MAXCONQW subsystem
parameter was reached since DDF was last started.

If the ALIAS and DETAIL options were specified on the DISPLAY DDF command, the output also includes detailed
information about the specific location alias:
 DSNL096I ADBAT=active-dbats CONQUED=concurrent-queued TCONS=total-connections
active-dbats
The number of active DBATs that are currently processing requests on behalf of the specified alias.
concurrent-queued
The number of connection requests that are currently queued and waiting to be serviced on behalf of the
specified alias.
total-connections
The total number of remote connections that are currently associated with the alias.
 DSNL100I, DSNL101I, DSNL102I: Server list information:
The output also includes server list information if the following conditions are true:
v The DETAIL option was specified on the DISPLAY DDF command
v DDF is part of a data sharing group
v DDF is configured to use TCP/IP (If the value of tcp-port in message DSNL084I is NONE, DDF is not configured to
use TCP/IP.)
The following server list entry information is displayed for each DDF location or alias that registered to WLM as part
of the data sharing group:
 DSNL100I LOCATION SERVER LIST:
 DSNL101I WT IPADDR IPADDR
 DSNL102I weight ipv4-address ipv6-address
Message DSNL102I is repeated for each server list entry.
The server list information is provided to remote clients that are balancing the sysplex workload. The server list
information might represent a single member of the data sharing group or a location alias that represents either a
single member or a subset of members. This information influences which DDF is sent future work. DDF responds
with an updated server list when DDF generates the response to a connection request or a connection reuse request.
weight The WLM weight for the DDF location or location alias that is identified by the IP addresses. If no value is
displayed, WLM indicates that DDF has no capacity and the entry is not included in the server list that is
provided to the remote clients.
ipv4-address
The IPv4 address that is used to identify a DDF location or location alias that is registered to WLM. The
address is in colon-hexadecimal format. If no IPv4 address is configured, this IP address is not displayed.
ipv6-address
The IPv6 address that is used to identify a DDF location or location alias that is registered to WLM. The
address is in colon-hexadecimal format. If no IPv6 address is configured, this IP address is not displayed.

Version 8 (CM8, CM8*, ENFM8, and ENFM8*)
v Values '2' and '3' identify modification levels in conversion and enabling-new-function mode from
Version 9 (CM9, CM9*, ENFM9, and ENFM9*)
v Value 4 is reserved.
v Values '5', '6', '7', '8', and '9' identify modification levels in new-function mode.
For example, if the identified product is Version 10 of DB2 for z/OS in new-function mode, the value is
DSN10015'.
T The connection type with the remote location. Expected values are:
R A requester connection from the local subsystem that is accessing a remote system.
S A server connection from a remote system that is accessing the local subsystem.
ATT and CONNS
The type and number of connections with the partner location. When the ATT column is blank, the value of
CONNS is the total number of connections with the partner location. The ATT column is blank unless the
DETAIL option is specified.
The meanings of the ATT values are:
AES The connection uses AES encryption.
IPS The connection uses Internet Protocol security (IPSec).
TLS The connection uses a secure sockets layer (SSL) that is provided by Application
Transparent-Transport Layer Security (AT-TLS).
TRS The connection is a trusted connection.
WLB The connection is from a client that is using Sysplex workload balancing.
XA The connection is part of a distributed transaction.
No locations found: When the DISPLAY LOCATION command is unable to find any locations that are associated
with the specified list of locations, a message line indicates that no locations were found.
If all locations were specified, there is no distributed activity. If a location list was specified, reissue the DISPLAY
LOCATION command with the LOCATION(*) parameter to display information for all locations.
Truncated output: If the output was generated in response to a command from an MVS console and more than 254
response messages were generated, the output is truncated. A message line indicates this truncation.
You can reissue the DISPLAY LOCATION command and specify a specific location or list of locations to see complete
output for that context.
Detail output: When a DISPLAY LOCATION command is issued with the DETAIL option, the output might contain
additional lines for each remote location.
The output might contain one or more lines that provide information about the number of connections from or to
remote systems that have certain attributes:
LOCATION
The identifier for the remote location.
v For TCP/IP requester connections, the location is the IP address concatenated with the port number of the
remote location. For TCP/IP server connections, the location is the IP address of the remote location.
v For SNA connections, the location is the LU name of the remote location.

S A server connection from a remote system that is accessing the local subsystem.
ATT and CONNS
The number of connections that are associated with the remote location and that have the attribute that is
identified by the ATT column. Because more than one attribute might apply to the same connection, the total
number of connections is not the sum of the numbers for the different attributes. The expected values for
ATT are:
AES Using security credentials with AES encryption.
IPS Using IPSec.
TLS SSL using Application Transparent-Transport Layer Security (AT-TLS).
TRS Using trusted context.
WLB Using workload balancing connections.
XA Using XA transaction manager processing.
The output might also include lines that contain detailed information about the connections that are associated with
the DB2 system thread. A line that is identified by the partial message number L203 provides descriptive headings.

-MODIFY DDF (DB2) (DB2 Commands)
DSNL302I option-name IS SET TO option-value
Explanation: A MODIFY DDF command has changed an option.
option-name
The name of the DDF processing option.
option-value
The new value of the named processing option. When option-name is PKGREL, possible values are:
BNDOPT
When a connection which has used a high performance DBAT terminates, the high performance
DBAT is also be deallocated.
BNDPOOL
DDF processing is the as BNDOPT, with the following exception. When a connection that was used
for a high performance DBAT terminates, the high performance DBAT is pooled. The pooled DBAT
can then be used by another connection that presents a request to the subsystem.
COMMIT
Packages are always allocated under RELEASE(COMMIT) rules regardless of their package
RELEASE bind option value.
When an access thread has completed a unit of work, and the DBAT can be pooled, DDF pools the
DBAT, makes an accounting record, deletes the current WLM enclave, and inactivates the
connection. Pooled access threads release all package allocation locks.
If the CMTSTAT subsystem parameter is set to ACTIVE, then the message will always indicate that
PKGREL IS SET TO COMMIT, regardless of the value specified on the command.

-MODIFY DDF (DB2) (DB2 Commands)
DSNL303I THE MODIFY DDF COMMAND FAILED WITH RC=return-code and RSN=reason-code
Explanation: A BSDS error was encountered.
return-code
DB2 return code from the BSDS function.
reason-code
DB2 reason code from the BSDS function.
System action: The command is not processed.
User response: Analyze the return code and reason code to determine what type of error occurred. Refer to
messages DSNJ107I and DSNJ108I for more information.
DSNL304I THE ALIAS alias-name ALREADY EXISTS.
Explanation: The MODIFY DDF command was issued to add an ALIAS but the requested alias name already exists
and the alias cannot be added.
alias-name
The name of the location alias.
System action: The command is not processed.
User response: Specify an alias that does not already exist. You can use the output from DISPLAY DDF command to
see the list of aliases that are currently defined.
DSNL305I THE ALIAS alias-name DOES NOT EXIST.
Explanation: The MODIFY DDF command was issued against an alias that does not exist.
alias-name
The name defines the location alias.
System action: The command is not processed.
User response: Specify an alias that already exists. You can use the output from the DISPLAY DDF command to see
the list of aliases that are currently defined.
DSNL306I THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SUPPORTED ALIASES HAS BEEN EXCEEDED.
Explanation: The modify DDF command was issued to add a new alias, but the new alias would exceed the
maximum number of aliases that can be defined. You can define as many as 40 aliases by using the MODIFY DDF
command.
System action: The command is not processed.
User response: Delete unneeded aliases before adding additional aliases. You can use the output from the DISPLAY
DDF command to see the list of currently defined aliases.
DSNL307I invalid-value IS NOT A VALID PARAMETER FOR keyword.
Explanation: An invalid parameter value is specified for the MODIFY DDF command.
invalid-value
The invalid value that was specified.
keyword The option keyword for which the invalid value was specified.
IPv4 invalid-value is not in the dotted decimal format.
IPv6 invalid-value is not in the colon hexadecimal format.
PORT invalid-value is not a decimal number between 1 and 65535, including 65535.
SECPORT
invalid-value is not a decimal number between 1 and 65535, including 65535.
ALIAS invalid-value is not a valid alias name. The alias name must meet all of the following requirements:
v Contains a maximum of 16 characters
v Contains only letters (excluding alphabetic extenders), numbers, or the underscore character.
v Begins with a letter.
System action: The command is not processed.
User response: Reissue the command and specify a value in the valid format for the keyword that you specified.
DSNL308I NO address-port IS DEFINED FOR THE ALIAS alias-name.
Explanation: The MODIFY DDF command was issued to delete an IP address or port , but an IP address or port is
not associated with the ALIAS.
address-port
One of the following values:
IPV4 ADDRESS
No IPv4 address is defined for the alias.
IPV6 ADDRESS
No IPv6 address is defined for the alias.
PORT No port is defined for the alias.
SECPORT
No secure port is defined for the alias.
alias-name
The name of the location alias.
System action: The command is not processed.
User response: Use the output from the DISPLAY DDF command with the ALIAS keyword to see the list of IP
addresses, ports, and secure ports that are associated with each alias.
DSNL309I MEMBER-SPECIFIC IP ADDRESSES ARE NOT DEFINED.
Explanation: DDF is stopped and its TCP/IP configuration is unknown or DDF is started but configured to receive
only from a specific IP address.
To issue a MODIFY DDF command with the ALIAS keyword and the IPV4 or IPV6 option, DDF must be configured
to receive from any IP address. To configure DDF to receive from any IP address, the DDF communications record
that is defined in the BSDS must be configured with the DDF IPV4 or IPV6 option. The MODIFY DDF command can
be used to add or modify alias IP addresses only when an IP address is defined by the DSNJU003 utility and not by
the PORT statement of the TCP/IP profile.
System action: The command is not processed.
User response: Use the output from DSNJU004 utility (the DDF communication record) to verify that no IP address
was specified in the BSDS. Specify at least one IP address by using the DSNJU003 utility.
DSNL310I THE ALIAS keyword keyword-value IS ALREADY IN USE.
Explanation: The port number specified for the PORT or SECPORT keyword in the MODIFY DDF command is
already in use for the location, or for a different alias.
keyword PORT or SECPORT
keyword-value
The value specified for the PORT or SECPORT keyword.
System action: The command is not processed.
User response: Use the output from the DISPLAY DDF command to see the ports that are defined for each alias and
location name.
DSNL311I THE ALIAS alias-name CANNOT BE STARTED.
Explanation: The specified alias cannot be started because it is not stopped or canceled.
alias-name
The name of the location alias.
System action: The command is not processed.
User response: Use the output from DISPLAY DDF command to check the status of each alias. Only stopped or
canceled aliases can be started.
DSNL312I THE ALIAS alias-name CANNOT BE STOPPED OR CANCELED.
Explanation: The MODIFY DDF command was issued with the ALIAS parameter to stop or cancel an alias but the
alias is not started.
alias-name
The name of the location alias.
System action: The command is not processed.
User response: Use the output from DISPLAY DDF command to check the status of each alias. Only started aliases
can be stopped, and only started aliases can be canceled.
DSNL313I THE ALIAS alias-name CANNOT BE MODIFIED OR DELETED.
Explanation: The MODIFY DDF command was issued to modify an attribute of an alias that is already started. The
alias must be stopped or canceled before it can be modified or deleted.
alias-name
The name that specifies the location alias.
System action: The command is not processed.
User response: Stop or cancel the specified alias, and then modify the alias attribute, or delete the alias. Use the
output from DISPLAY DDF command (DSNL088I) to see the status of each alias.
DSNL314I THE ALIAS alias-name IS state.
Explanation: The MODIFY DDF command was issued with the ALIAS keyword to start, stop, or cancel an alias,
and the specified operation was successful.
alias-name
The name of the location alias.
state Whether the alias was STARTED, STOPPED, or CANCELED.
System action: The system action depends on the action that was successful:
STARTED
DB2 begins accepting new connections for the alias.
STOPPED
DB2 stops accepting new connections to the alias. All data base access threads processing connections to the
specified alias have finished their processing.
CANCELED
DB2 stops accepting new connections to the alias and cancels all existing connections.
User response: No action required.
DSNL315I A DYNAMICALLY DEFINED ALIAS WITH NAME alias-name ALREADY EXISTS.
Explanation: An alias that was defined by the DSNJU003 utility has the same name as an existing alias that was
already defined by the MODIFY DDF commands. The new alias that was defined by the DSNJU003 utility is ignored
because the alias that was defined by the MODIFY DDF command takes precedence.
System action: The existing alias that was defined by the MODIFY DDF command is used and new the statically
defined alias is ignored.
User response: You can define location aliases statically by using the using DSNJU003 utility or dynamically by
using the MODIFY DDF command. Dynamic aliases are preferable because you can define and modify them without
stopping and restarting DB2 or DDF. When a static and dynamic alias each have the same name, only the dynamic
alias is used. If you want to use the statically defined alias instead, use the MODIFY DDF command to delete the
dynamic location alias that has the matching name. You can use the output from DISPLAY DDF command to see the
list of aliases that are currently defined. The alias status is 'STATIC' for statically defined aliases.
DSNL400E INDOUBT THREAD RESOLUTION WITH COORDINATOR location SHOWS HEURISTIC DAMAGE FOR luwid=token - REMOTE COMMIT VERSUS LOCAL ABORT. INFORMATION RECORDED IN TRACE RECORD WITH IFCID=207 AND IFCID SEQUENCE NUMBER=seq-no1 AND IN TRACE RECORD WITH IFCID=203 AND IFCID SEQUENCE NUMBER=seq-no2
Explanation: DB2 has participant responsibility in the logical unit of work identified by 'luwid=token'. Resolution
with the coordinator identified by 'location' shows heuristic damage occurred. The DB2 thread representing the
logical unit of work was previously resolved using the RECOVER INDOUBT command. The action taken was to
abort the thread. Subsequently, communication was reestablished with the coordinator and resolution shows that the
coordinator committed the thread.
v The application was told that commit succeeded.
v Any resources updated at the coordinator were committed.
v Updated resources at this DB2 were rolled back.
location
The field contains one of the following:
v The requester's relational database name (location name)
v The requester's VTAM LU name (<luname>)
v The requester's IP address
luwid=token
The global logical unit of work id and the local token that identify the thread.
seq-no1
The IFCID sequence number associated with the 207 trace record. The sequence number is printed in
hexadecimal format. If the sequence number is zero, IFCID 207 was not active or it was active with a
destination of the resident trace table only. IFCID 207 is a member of statistics class 4, which has a default
destination of SMF. This trace record is written when the heuristic damage condition was detected and
contains information about the damage condition.
seq-no2
The IFCID sequence number associated with the 203 trace record. The sequence number is printed in
hexadecimal format. If the sequence number is zero, IFCID 203 was not active or it was active with a
destination of the resident trace table only. IFCID 203 is a member of statistics class 4, which has a default
destination of SMF. This trace record was written when the heuristic decision to commit or abort was made
and contains information about the decision, including the names of any downstream participants.
System action: Alert A004 is generated. A trace record whose IFCID=207 is written. Indoubt resolution with the
coordinator completes.
System programmer response: Determine the destination of statistics class 4 and locate and print the trace record
with SEQUENCE NUMBER='seq-no1'. Call the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: Correct the damage. This is not an easy task. Since the time of the heuristic action,
the data that was aborted with the RECOVER INDOUBT command might have been used by many applications -
read and/or write. Correcting the damage might involve reversing the effects of these applications as well. Tools
available are:
v The statistics trace class 4 contains an IFCID 207 trace record. This record contains the RBA of the first DB2 log
record written for the logical unit of work whose LUWID is included in this message.
v The DSN1LOGP utility provides a summary report that identifies the table spaces modified by the logical unit of
work and any downstream participant locations involved in the logical unit of work.
v DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT) displays the RBA of the first DB2 log record written for the logical unit of
work whose LUWID is included in this message. This information continues to appear in the DISPLAY THREAD
report until it is purged with the RESET INDOUBT command.

DSNL402I INDOUBT THREAD RESOLUTION WITH PARTICIPANT location SHOWS HEURISTIC DAMAGE FOR luwid=token - REMOTE COMMIT VERSUS LOCAL ABORT. INFORMATION RECORDED IN TRACE RECORD WITH IFCID=207 AND IFCID SEQUENCE NUMBER=seq-no
Explanation: DB2 has coordinator responsibility for the logical unit of work identified by 'luwid=token'. Resolution
with a participant shows heuristic damage occurred. The participant identified by 'location' manually resolved the
indoubt thread identified by 'luwid=token'. The action taken was to commit the thread. This is inconsistent with the
abort decision of the coordinator.
v The application was told that commit failed.
v Any resources updated at the participant were committed.
v Updated resources at this DB2 were rolled back.
location
The field contains one of the following:
v The requester's relational database name (location name)
v The requester's VTAM LU name (<luname>)
v The requester's IP address
luwid=token
The global logical unit of work id and the local token that identify the thread.
seq-no The IFCID sequence number associated with the trace record. The sequence number is printed in
hexadecimal format. If the sequence number is zero, then IFCID 207 was not active or it was active with a
destination of the resident trace table only. IFCID 207 is a member of statistics class 4, which has a default
destination of SMF.
If the location specified refers to a DB2 Linux, UNIX, and Windows system that is running at the Version 9.1 level or
later, and that server location has enabled access to non-DB2 databases through the Federated Database or
Information Integrator capability, then any updates made to that downstream non-DB2 database will be processed
under the control of the DB2 Version 9.1 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows unprotected update capability. This permits
changes to be made to this downstream non-DB2 database, even when the changes were being requested through
applications running under two-phase commit or protected update control, such as CICS and IMS. During phase one
of commit processing, the DB2 V9.1 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows server will have actually committed the changes
to the downstream non-DB2 database by the time it replies to this DB2 that it is prepared to accept a commit decision
from. However, if during phase one commit negotiation with other downstream database servers and other
coordinated resource managers from CICS or IMS, the decision is made to abort the unit of work, this will result in
heuristic damage to the data at the non-DB2 database downstream of the DB2 V9.1 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows
server. No attempts will be made to resync with the identified remote location server, and a DB2 indoubt thread will
not be left in DB2 to reflect this issue.
System action: Alert A004 is generated. A trace record whose IFCID=207 is written. Indoubt resolution with the
participant completes.
System programmer response: Call the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: Inform the database administrator at 'location' that heuristic damage occurred for
the logical unit of work with LUWID='luwid'. DB2 was the coordinator for the logical unit of work and made the
decision to abort the database updates made by 'luwid'. At 'location' a heuristic decision was made to COMMIT the
updates made by 'luwid'.
Information about the heuristic damage continues to appear in the DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT) report until
it is purged with the RESET INDOUBT command.
DSNL403I INDOUBT THREAD RESOLUTION WITH PARTICIPANT location SHOWS HEURISTIC DAMAGE FOR luwid=token - REMOTE ABORT VERSUS LOCAL COMMIT. INFORMATION RECORDED IN TRACE RECORD WITH IFCID=207 AND IFCID SEQUENCE NUMBER=seq-no
Explanation: DB2 has coordinator responsibility for the logical unit of work identified by 'luwid=token'. Resolution
with a participant shows heuristic damage occurred. The participant identified by 'location' manually resolved the
indoubt thread identified by 'luwid=token'. The action taken was to abort the thread. This is inconsistent with the
commit decision of the coordinator.
v The application was told that commit succeeded.
v Any resources updated at the participant were rolled back.
v Updated resources at this DB2 were committed.

v The requester's VTAM LU name (<luname>)
v The requester's IP address
luwid=token
The global logical unit of work id and the local token that identify the thread.
seq-no The IFCID sequence number associated with the trace record. The sequence number is printed in
hexadecimal format. If the sequence number is zero, IFCID 207 was not active or it was active with a
destination of the resident trace table only. IFCID 207 is a member of statistics class 4, which has a default
destination of SMF.
System action: Alert A004 is generated. A trace record with IFCID 207 is written. Indoubt resolution with the
participant completes.
System programmer response: Call the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: Inform the database administrator at 'location' that heuristic damage occurred for
the logical unit of work with LUWID='luwid'. DB2 was the coordinator for the logical unit of work and made the
decision to COMMIT the database updates made by 'luwid'. At 'location' a heuristic decision was made to back out
(ABORT) the updates made by 'luwid'.
Information about the heuristic damage continues to appear in the DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT) report until
it is purged with the RESET INDOUBT command.
DSNL404E PROTOCOL ERROR DURING INDOUBT THREAD RESOLUTION WITH COORDINATOR location LUWID=luwid=token INFORMATION RECORDED IN TRACE RECORD WITH IFCID=206 AND IFCID SEQUENCE NUMBER=seq-no
Explanation: DB2 has participant responsibility for the logical unit of work identified by 'luwid=token'. The DB2
thread associated with the logical unit of work is indoubt. A protocol error occurred during indoubt resolution with
the coordinator identified by 'location'.
location
Either the relational database name (location-name) or the logical unit name (<luname>) of the coordinator.
luwid=token
The global logical unit of work id and the local token that identify the thread.
seq-no The IFCID sequence number associated with the trace record. The sequence number is printed in
hexadecimal format. If the sequence number is zero, IFCID 206 was not active or it was active with a
destination of the resident trace table only. IFCID 206 is a member of statistics class 4, which has a default
destination of SMF.
System action: The indoubt thread remains indoubt. Alert A003 is generated. A trace record whose IFCID=206 is
written.
System programmer response: This is an APARable error, probably at the coordinator, but possibly at the DB2
participant. The DB2 documentation required is contained in the statistics class 4 trace record that was written.
Determine the destination of statistics class 4. Locate and print the trace record with SEQUENCE NUMBER='seq-no'.
Call the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: DB2 does not attempt to automatically resolve the indoubt thread. The indoubt
thread must be manually resolved. The commit or abort decision made at the coordinator must be determined so that
the same decision can be made at this participant DB2.
Contact the database administrator at the coordinator location to determine whether the thread with LUWID=luwid
committed or aborted.
If the coordinator system is another DB2, the following steps can be taken at the DB2 coordinator to determine the
commit or abort decision.
1. If the coordinator DB2 system is running and a DB2 conditional restart was not performed since the error was
detected at this (the participant) location, ask the database administrator at the DB2 coordinator location to issue
one of the following DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT) commands:
v A -DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT), using the LOCATION keyword and specifying the location name of
the local DB2.
v A -DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT) LUWID(luwid)
If a thread with LUWID=luwid appears in the display, then the display also includes the commit or abort
decision. If no thread with LUWID=luwid appears in the display, the thread was aborted.
2. If the DB2 coordinator is down, or if a conditional restart was performed there, ask the database administrator at
the DB2 coordinator to run DSN1LOGP, specifying SUMMARY(ONLY) FILTER LUWID(luwid). The output from
DSN1LOGP includes the commit or abort decision.
Use the RECOVER INDOUBT command at this (the participant) location to resolve the indoubt thread.
DSNL405I THREAD luwid=token PLACED IN INDOUBT STATE BECAUSE OF COMMUNICATION FAILURE WITH COORDINATOR location. INFORMATION RECORDED IN TRACE RECORD WITH IFCID=209 AND IFCID SEQUENCE NUMBER=seq-no
Explanation: During execution of the two phase commit protocol with the coordinator identified by 'location',
communication failed. Phase 1 of the protocol completed and the thread is prepared for either commit or abort.
The thread is placed in the indoubt state and appears in a DISPLAY THREAD TYPE (INDOUBT) report. Periodic
attempts are made to reestablish communication with the coordinator for automatic indoubt resolution. If successful,
message DSNL407 or DSNL415 is written.
luwid=token
The global logical unit of work id and the local token that identify the thread.
location
This field contains one of the following:
v The requester's relational database name (location name)
v The requester's VTAM LU name (<luname>)
v The requester's IP address
seq-no The IFCID sequence number associated with the trace record. The sequence number is printed in
hexadecimal format. If the sequence number is zero, IFCID 209 was not active or it was active with a
destination of the resident trace table only. IFCID 209 is a member of statistics class 4, which has a default
destination of SMF.
System action: Alert A006 is generated. A trace record whose IFCID=209 is written.
Operator response: If message DSNL407 or DSNL415 for the LUWID specified in the DSNL405 message does not
appear in a reasonable amount of time, call the system programmer.
System programmer response: Determine the cause of the communication failure and have the problem fixed. DB2
periodically attempts to reestablish communication. If the problem cannot be fixed in a reasonable amount of time,
call the database administrator. Manual resolution of the indoubt thread might be necessary to release locked
resources.
Database Administrator Action: Take the following actions to resolve this thread using manual means (that is, take
heuristic action) if it is necessary to release locks held by this thread.
v Determine the proper commit or abort decision by contacting the database administrator at the coordinator
'location' shown in this message in order to determine whether the thread with LUWID=luwid committed or
aborted.
If the coordinator system is another DB2, the following steps can be taken at the DB2 coordinator to determine the
commit or abort decision.
1. If the coordinator DB2 system is running and a DB2 conditional restart was not performed since the error was
detected at this (the participant) location, ask the database administrator at the DB2 coordinator location to
issue one of the following DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT) commands:
C A -DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT), using the LOCATION keyword and specifying the location name
of the local DB2.
C A -DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT) LUWID(luwid)
If a thread with LUWID=luwid appears in the display, then the display also includes the commit or abort
decision. If no thread with LUWID=luwid appears in the display, then the thread was aborted.
2. If the DB2 coordinator is down or if a conditional restart was performed there, ask the database administrator
at the DB2 coordinator to run DSN1LOGP, specifying SUMMARY(ONLY) FILTER LUWID(luwid). The output
from DSN1LOGP includes the commit or abort decision.
v Use the RECOVER INDOUBT command to commit or abort the thread.
DSNL406I THREAD luwid=token AT PARTICIPANT location MAY BE INDOUBT BECAUSE OF A COMMUNICATION FAILURE. DB2 COMMITTED THE THREAD. INFORMATION RECORDED IN TRACE RECORD WITH IFCID=209 AND IFCID SEQUENCE NUMBER=seq-no
Explanation: During execution of the two phase commit protocol with the participant identified by 'location',
communications failed. Phase 1 of the protocol completed with the participant, which is prepared to either commit or
abort. The decision to commit the thread was made, but cannot be communicated to the participant at this time. The
participant is indoubt.
DB2 becomes responsible for indoubt resolution with the participant. This responsibility appears in a DISPLAY
THREAD TYPE (INDOUBT) report. Periodic attempts are made to reestablish communication with the participant for
automatic indoubt resolution. If successful, message DSNL423 is written.
luwid=token
The global logical unit of work id and the local token that identify the thread.
location
This field contains one of the following:
v The requester's relational database name (location name)
v The requester's VTAM LU name (<luname>)
v The requester's IP address
seq-no The IFCID sequence number associated with the trace record. The sequence number is printed in
hexadecimal format. If the sequence number is zero, IFCID 209 was not active or it was active with a
destination of the resident trace table only. IFCID 209 is a member of statistics class 4, which has a default
destination of SMF.
System action: Alert A006 is generated. A trace record whose IFCID=209 is written.
Operator response: If message DSNL423 for the LUWID specified in message DSNL406 does not appear in a
reasonable amount of time, call the system programmer.
System programmer response: Determine the cause of the communication failure and have the problem fixed. DB2
periodically attempts to reestablish communication. If the problem cannot be fixed in a reasonable amount of time,
call the database administrator. The participant might need to manually resolve the indoubt state to release locked
resources.
Database Administrator Action: If the unit of work with LUWID=luwid is indoubt at 'location', inform the database
administrator there that the logical unit of work with LUWID=luwid was committed to assist in manual resolution of
the indoubt thread at 'location'.
DSNL407I AUTOMATIC RESOLUTION OF luwid=token WITH COORDINATOR location RESULTED IN COMMIT
Explanation: The identified indoubt logical unit of work was automatically resolved by communication with the
coordinator location. After automatic resolution, this message is issued if message DSNL405 was previously issued to
report the thread as indoubt. This message is not issued if message DSNL405 occurs in one restart of DDF or DB2,
and automatic resolution occurs in a different restart of DDF or DB2.

Explanation: DB2 has participant responsibility in the logical unit of work identified by 'luwid=token' for the
coordinator at COORDINATOR 'location' and coordination responsibility in the same logical unit of work for the
participant at PARTICIPANT 'location'. Heuristic damage occurred.
v The application was told that commit succeeded.

The global logical unit of work id and the local token that identify the thread.
seq-no The IFCID sequence number associated with the trace record. The sequence number is printed in
hexadecimal format. If the sequence number is zero, then IFCID 207 was not active or it was active with a
destination of the resident trace table only. IFCID 207 is a member of statistics class 4, which has a default
destination of SMF.
System action: Alert A004 is generated. A trace record whose IFCID=207 is written. Indoubt resolution with the
coordinator completes.
System programmer response: Determine the destination of statistics class 4. Locate and print the trace record with
SEQUENCE NUMBER='seq-no'. Call the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: Inform the database administrator at the coordinator 'location' and at the participant
'location' of the problem.
Correcting the damage at the participant is not an easy task. Since the time of the heuristic action, the data that was
aborted using manual means might have been used by many applications - read and/or write. Correcting the
damage might involve reversing the effects of these applications as well. The following information that is available
at DB2 might be helpful in correcting the problem:
v The statistics trace class 4 contains an IFCID 207 trace record. This record contains the RBA of the first DB2 log
record written for the logical unit of work whose LUWID is included in this message.
v The DSN1LOGP utility provides a summary report that identifies the table spaces modified by the logical unit of
work at the local DB2 as well as any downstream participant locations involved in the logical unit of work. This
information, while not directly related to the damage at the participant, might be useful in determining the scope
of the problem.
v DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT) displays the RBA of the first DB2 log record written for the logical unit of
work whose LUWID is included in this message. This information continues to appear in the DISPLAY THREAD

DSNL410I WARM START CONNECTION BY PARTNER location REJECTED. PARTNER CHANGED AT LEAST
1 OF - OUR LOG NAME oldourname(newourname), THEIR LOG NAME oldtheirname(newtheirname),
PA_SUPPORT oldpa(newpa), FLAG_BYTE_SENT oldfb(newfb), CCLUNAME_SENT oldccls(newccls),
AND INDOUBT THREADS REQUIRE RESOLUTION. SEE IFCID=205 TRACE RECORD WITH
IFCID SEQUENCE NUMBER=seq-no.
Explanation: An attempt to make a warm start connection with a partner was rejected because the partner specified
a different set of sync point parameters than the ones that were in use when communications were lost. DB2 has
knowledge of indoubt threads that involve the partner as either the coordinator or a participant. This error might be
a recoverable error if the partner can restart with the original sync point parameters. If this is not possible, then the
partner must perform a cold start connection with DB2.
location
The 'location' with which the connection failed: either the relational database name (location-name) or the
logical unit name (<luname>) of the partner.
oldourname
The log name for this DB2 subsystem. This value is null if the partner did not initiate the log name
exchange.
newourname
The log name for this DB2 subsystem, as remembered by our partner and sent to us in the attempted warm
start connection. This value is null if the partner did not initiate the log name exchange.
oldtheirname
The log name used by the partner during the last connection, as remembered by DB2.
newtheirname
The log name used by the partner in the attempted warm start connection.
oldpa The sync point protocol used during the last connection, as remembered by the DB2 (PA - Presumed Abort,
PN - Presumed Nothing).
newpa The sync point protocol used during the last connection, as remembered by the partner (PA - Presumed
Abort, PN - Presumed Nothing).
oldfb The use of the PS header byte 2 during the last connection, as remembered by DB2 (F - used as flag byte, N
- not used as flag byte).
newfb The use of the PS header byte 2 during the last connection, as remembered by the partner (F - used as flag
byte, N - not used as flag byte).
oldccls Whether the luname of the conversation correlator was exchanged as part of the sync point protocol during
the last connection, as remembered by DB2. (E - was exchanged, N - was not exchanged).
newccls
Whether the luname of the conversation correlator was exchanged as part of the sync point protocol during
the last connection, as remembered by the partner (E - was exchanged, N - was not exchanged).
seq-no The IFCID sequence number associated with the trace record. The sequence number is printed in
hexadecimal format. If the sequence number is zero, then IFCID 0205 was not active or it was active with a
destination of the resident trace table only. IFCID 0205 is a member of statistics class 4, which has a default
destination of SMF.
System action: The connection with the partner is rejected. Alert A002 is generated. DB2 retains indoubt knowledge.
System programmer response: Call the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: Contact the database administrator at the partner 'location' and determine if it is
possible for the partner to perform a warm start with same sync point parameters as ours ('oldourname',
'oldtheirname', 'oldpa', 'oldfb', 'oldccls'). If this is possible, the next attempt to connect will succeed.
If this cannot be done, then there are two other possible solutions:
v Have the partner 'location' perform a cold start connection with this DB2 subsystem.
v Use the RESET INDOUBT command with the FORCE option in conjunction with the LOCATION parameter to
cause the next connection with the partner to be a cold start connection.
DSNL411E COLD START CONNECTION BY COORDINATOR location ACCEPTED. INDOUBT THREADS NEED MANUAL RESOLUTION. INFORMATION RECORDED IN TRACE RECORD WITH IFCID=204 AND IFCID SEQUENCE NUMBER=seq-no
Explanation: DB2 has participant responsibility for indoubt threads. The coordinator informed DB2 that it
performed a cold start operation and lost all knowledge of indoubt threads. The indoubt threads at this DB2 must be
manually resolved with the RECOVER INDOUBT command.
location
This field contains one of the following:
v The requester's relational database name (location name)
v The requester's VTAM LU name (<luname>)
v The requester's IP address
seq-no The IFCID sequence number associated with the trace record. The sequence number is printed in
hexadecimal format. If the sequence number is zero, then IFCID 204 was not active or it was active with a
destination of the resident trace table only. IFCID 204 is a member of statistics class 4, which has a default
destination of SMF.
This condition can falsely occur if the DDF communications database (CDB) contains definitions that allow a
subsystem to remotely access itself through SNA. To avoid this false condition, remove self-referencing CDB
definitions.
System action: The connection with the partner is accepted. Alert A001 is generated. A trace record whose
IFCID=204 is written.
System programmer response: Call the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: DB2 is a participant with one or more indoubt threads where the coordinator is
'location'. The DBMS at 'location' performed a cold start. The DB2 participant assumes that the coordinator recovery
log was lost or damaged and indoubt thread resolution cannot be achieved. There is probably inconsistent data at the
coordinator. A list of indoubt threads involving the coordinator 'location' can be displayed using the DISPLAY
THREAD command for indoubt type threads by including the LOCATION('location') parameter in the command.
The heuristic decision (that is, to commit or abort the logical unit of work) should be coordinated with any other
participants. The existence of other participants might not be easy to determine. The information might be available
in the coordinators recovery log even though the coordinator performed a cold start. If the coordinator is a DB2, then
it might be possible to execute the DSN1LOGP utility to produce a summary report. If this is possible, the following
information might be produced:
v The LUWID of the thread.
v The NID used by IMS or CICS to identify the thread.
v The name of all participants.
v The name of an upstream coordinator if the coordinator is also a participant. This could happen when an
application requester accesses a DB2 AS using application-directed access, which in turn accesses another DB2
server with system-directed access. (The local DB2 might be the third system in this scenario.)
At this DB2 participant, all indoubt threads coordinated by the cold starting location must be resolved with the
RECOVER INDOUBT command. Locked data remains unavailable until resolution. Threads that were already
resolved with this command are discarded. Threads not yet resolved are discarded after resolution with the
command.
The commit or abort decision provided using the RECOVER INDOUBT command for a logical unit of work are
propagated to all downstream participants, if any.
DSNL412I PROTOCOL ERROR DETECTED IN SYNCPOINT REQUEST/RESPONSE FROM COORDINATOR location LUWID=luwid=token. INFORMATION RECORDED IN TRACE RECORD WITH IFCID=208 AND IFCID SEQUENCE NUMBER=seq-no
Explanation: DB2 is a participant in the logical unit of work identified by 'luwid=token'. A protocol error occurred
during the SNA sync point exchange with the coordinator identified by 'location'. The protocol error fits into one of
the following categories:
v An unknown SNA PS header was received.
v An SNA PS header was received in the wrong sequence.
v An invalid LU6.2 verb sequence was used to deliver the SNA PS header.
v A DEALLOCATE TYPE(ABEND_SVC) was received from the coordinator, indicating that the coordinator detected
a protocol violation in the PS headers transmitted by DB2.
location
Either the relational database name (location-name) or the logical unit name (<luname>) of the coordinator.
luwid=token
The global logical unit of work id and the local token that identify the thread.
seq-no The IFCID sequence number associated with the trace record. The sequence number is printed in
hexadecimal format. If the sequence number is zero, IFCID 208 was not active or it was active with a
destination of the resident trace table only. IFCID 208 is a member of statistics class 4, which has a default
destination of SMF.
If the protocol error was detected before the commit decision, the unit of work at the DB2 system might be indoubt.
DB2 does not automatically resolve such an indoubt thread.
If the protocol error was detected after the commit decision, the unit of work either completed commit or abort
processing.
System action: Alert A005 is generated. A trace record whose IFCID=208 is written.
System programmer response: This is an APARable error, probably at the coordinator, but possibly at DB2. The DB2
documentation required is contained in the statistics class 4 trace record. Determine the destination of statistics class
4. Locate and print the trace record with SEQUENCE NUMBER='seq-no'.
The database administrator might need to manually resolve the indoubt thread.
Database Administrator Action: Determine if the 'luwid' is indoubt by using the DISPLAY THREAD command for
type indoubt threads and including the LUWID('token') parameter in the command. If the thread is indoubt, it must
be manually resolved using the RECOVER INDOUBT command. The commit or abort decision made at the
coordinator must be determined so that the same decision can be made at DB2.
Contact the database administrator at the coordinator location to determine whether the thread with LUWID=luwid
committed or aborted.
If the coordinator system is another DB2, then the following steps can be taken at the DB2 coordinator to determine
the commit or abort decision.
1. If the coordinator DB2 system is running and a DB2 conditional restart was not performed since the error was
detected at this (the participant) location, ask the database administrator at the DB2 coordinator location to issue
one of the following DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT) commands:
v A -DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT), using the LOCATION keyword and specifying the location name of
the local DB2.
v A -DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT) LUWID(luwid)
If a thread with LUWID=luwid appears in the display, then the display also includes the commit or abort
decision. If no thread with LUWID=luwid appears in the display, then the thread was aborted.
2. If the DB2 coordinator is down or if a conditional restart was performed there, ask the database administrator at
the DB2 coordinator to run DSN1LOGP, specifying SUMMARY(ONLY) FILTER LUWID(luwid). The output from
DSN1LOGP includes the commit or abort decision.
DSNL413I PROTOCOL ERROR DETECTED IN SYNCPOINT REQUEST/RESPONSE FROM PARTICIPANT location LUWID=luwid=token. INFORMATION RECORDED IN TRACE RECORD WITH IFCID=208 AND IFCID SEQUENCE NUMBER=seq-no
Explanation: DB2 is the coordinator of the logical unit of work identified by 'luwid=token'. A protocol error
occurred during the SNA sync point exchange with the participant identified by 'location'. The protocol error fits into
one of the following categories:
v An unknown SNA PS header was received.
v An SNA PS header was received in the wrong sequence.
v An invalid LU6.2 verb sequence was used to deliver the SNA PS header.
v A DEALLOCATE TYPE(ABEND_SVC) was received from the participant, indicating that the participant detected a
protocol violation in the PS headers transmitted by DB2.
location
The relational database name (location-name) of the participant.
luwid=token
The global logical unit of work id and the local token that identify the thread.
seq-no The IFCID sequence number associated with the trace record. The sequence number is printed in
hexadecimal format. If the sequence number is zero, IFCID 208 was not active or it was active with a
destination of the resident trace table only. IFCID 208 is a member of statistics class 4, which has a default
destination of SMF.
If the protocol error is detected before the commit decision, the unit of work is backed out.
If the protocol error is detected after the commit decision, the outcome of the unit of work is unchanged. In this case,
the remote participant might be indoubt. DB2 does not automatically resolve the indoubt thread with the partner
'location' after a protocol error is detected.
System action: Alert A005 is generated. A trace record whose IFCID=208 is written.
System programmer response: This is an APARable error, probably at the participant, but possibly at the DB2
coordinator. The DB2 documentation required is contained in the statistics class 4 trace record. Determine the
destination of statistics class 4. Locate and print the trace record with SEQUENCE NUMBER='seq-no'.
Call the database administrator. The participant might need to manually resolve the indoubt thread.
Database Administrator Action: The DB2 coordinator does not know the status of the thread at the participant. The
DB2 coordinator assumes that it is indoubt and maintains knowledge of the indoubt participant until it is purged
with the RESET INDOUBT command. If the thread is indoubt at the participant, it must be resolved using manual
(heuristic) means. The status of the thread at the local DB2 (the coordinator) can be determined with the DISPLAY
THREAD command for type indoubt threads by including the LUWID('token') parameter in the command.
If the 'participant' location is also a DB2, the RECOVER INDOUBT command can be used at the participant to
resolve the indoubt thread.
DSNL414E PROTOCOL ERROR DURING INDOUBT THREAD RESOLUTION WITH PARTICIPANT location LUWID=luwid=token INFORMATION RECORDED IN TRACE RECORD WITH IFCID=206 AND IFCID SEQUENCE NUMBER=seq-no
Explanation: DB2 has coordinator responsibility for the logical unit of work identified by 'luwid=token'. The DB2
thread associated with the logical unit of work is either committed or aborted. A protocol error occurred during
indoubt resolution with the participant identified by 'location'.
The thread at the participant remains indoubt. DB2 rejects further attempts to automatically resolve the indoubt
thread.
location
The relational database name (location-name) of the participant.
luwid=token
The global logical unit of work id and the local token that identify the thread.
seq-no The IFCID sequence number associated with the trace record. The sequence number is printed in
hexadecimal format. If the sequence number is zero, IFCID 206 was not active or it was active with a
destination of the resident trace table only. IFCID 206 is a member of statistics class 4, which has a default
destination of SMF.
System action: Alert A003 is generated. A trace record whose IFCID=206 is written.
System programmer response: This is an APARable error, probably at the participant, but possibly at the DB2
coordinator. The DB2 documentation required is contained in the statistics class 4 trace record. Determine the
destination of statistics class 4. Locate and print the trace record with SEQUENCE NUMBER='seq-no'.
Call the database administrator. The participant might need to manually resolve the indoubt thread.
Database Administrator Action: The DB2 coordinator maintains knowledge of the indoubt participant until it is
purged with the RESET INDOUBT command. If the thread is indoubt at the participant, it must be manually
(heuristically) resolved. The status of the thread at the local DB2 (the coordinator) can be determined with the
DISPLAY THREAD command for type indoubt threads by including the LUWID('token') parameter in the command.
If the participant is another DB2, the RECOVER INDOUBT command can be used to resolve the indoubt thread.
DSNL415I AUTOMATIC RESOLUTION OF luwid=token WITH COORDINATOR location RESULTED IN ABORT
Explanation: The identified indoubt logical unit of work was automatically resolved by communication with the
coordinator location. After automatic resolution, this message is issued if message DSNL405 was previously issued to
report the thread as indoubt. This message is not issued if message DSNL405 occurs in one restart of DDF or DB2,
and automatic resolution occurs in a different restart of DDF or DB2.
luwid=token
The global logical unit of work id and the local token that identify the thread
location
This field contains one of the following:
v The requester's relational database name (location name)
v The requester's VTAM LU name (<luname>)
v The requester's IP address
System action: Processing continues normally.
DSNL416I COLD START CONNECTION REJECTED BY PARTNER location
Explanation: DB2 attempted to make a cold-start connection with a partner location. The partner rejected this
attempted connection. DB2 never rejects cold-start connections by partners.
location
Either the relational database name (location-name) or the logical unit name (<luname>) of the partner.
System action: The connection was not made.
System programmer response: Call the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: DB2 is not able to connect the partner 'location' until the partner 'location' allows a
cold-start connection with DB2. Contact the database administrator at the partner 'location'.
Contact your IBM Support Center for further assistance.
DSNL417E csect-name COLD START DETECTED AT COORDINATOR LOCATION location FOR INDOUBT THREAD WITH luwid=token. MANUAL RESOLUTION IS REQUIRED. INFORMATION RECORDED IN TRACE RECORD WITH IFCID=204 and IFC SEQUENCE NUMBER=seq-no.
Explanation: DB2 has resync responsibility for the indoubt thread identified. The partner location informed DB2 that
it had performed a cold start operation and lost all knowledge of this indoubt thread. This indoubt thread must be
manually resolved with the RECOVER INDOUBT command, followed by the RESET INDOUBT command.
location
This field contains one of the following:
v The requester's relational database name (location name)
v The requester's VTAM LU name (<luname>)
v The requester's IP address
luwid=token
The logical unit of work id and the local token that identify the thread.
seq-no The IFCID sequence number associated with the trace record. The sequence number is printed in
hexadecimal format. If the sequence number is zero, then IFCID 204 was not active or it was active with a
destination of the resident trace table only. IFCID 204 is a member of statistics class 4, which has a default
destination of SMF and contains information about a partner's cold start.
System action: Alert A001 is generated. A trace record whose IFCID=204 is written.
System programmer response: Call the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: DB2 is a participant with one or more indoubt threads where the coordinator is
'location'. The DBMS at 'location' performed a cold start. The DB2 participant assumes that the coordinator recovery
log was lost or damaged and indoubt thread resolution cannot be achieved. There may be inconsistent data at the
coordinator. A list of indoubt threads involving the coordinator 'location' can be displayed using the DISPLAY
THREAD command for indoubt type threads by including the LOCATION('location') parameter in the command.
The heuristic decision (that is, to commit or abort the logical unit of work) should be coordinated with any other
participants. The existence of other participants might not be easy to determine. The information might be available
in the coordinators recovery log even though the coordinator performed a cold start. If the coordinator is a DB2, then
it might be possible to execute the DSN1LOGP utility to produce a summary report. If this is possible, the following
information might be produced:
v The LUWID of the thread.
v The NID used by IMS or CICS to identify the thread.
v The name of all participants.
v The name of an upstream coordinator if the coordinator is also a participant. This could happen when an
application requester accesses a DB2 AS using application-directed access, which in turn accesses another DB2
server with system-directed access. (The local DB2 might be the third system in this scenario.)
At this DB2 participant, all indoubt threads coordinated by the cold starting location must be resolved with the
RECOVER INDOUBT command. Locked data remains unavailable until resolution. Threads that were already
resolved with this command are discarded. Threads not yet resolved are discarded after resolution with the
command.
The commit or abort decision provided using the RECOVER INDOUBT command for a logical unit of work are
propagated to all downstream participants, if any.
DSNL418E csect-name COLD START DETECTED AT PARTICIPANT LOCATION location FOR INDOUBT THREAD WITH luwid=token. POSSIBLE DAMAGE. INFORMATION RECORDED IN TRACE RECORD WITH IFCID=204 and IFC SEQUENCE NUMBER=seq-no.
Explanation: DB2 has coordinator responsibility for the indoubt thread identified. The partner location informed
DB2 that it had performed a cold start operation and lost all knowledge of this indoubt thread. There might be
damage at the participant.
location
This field contains one of the following:
v The requester's relational database name (location name)
v The requester's VTAM LU name (<luname>)
v The requester's IP address
luwid=token
The global logical unit of work id and the local token that identify the thread.
seq-no The IFCID sequence number associated with the trace record. The sequence number is printed in
hexadecimal format. If the sequence number is zero, then IFCID 204 was not active or it was active with a
destination of the resident trace table only. IFCID 204 is a member of statistics class 4, which has a default
destination of SMF.
System action: Alert A001 is generated. A trace record whose IFCID=204 is written.
System programmer response: Call the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: DB2 is the coordinator with indoubt thread resolution responsibility for one or more
indoubt logical units of work at 'location'. The DBMS at 'location' performed a cold start. DB2 assumes that the
participant recovery log was lost or damaged and indoubt thread resolution cannot be achieved. There is probably
inconsistent data at the participant. Minimally, the participant might not completely reflect the final outcome of the
threads that were indoubt at the time the failure occurred. A list of indoubt threads involving the partner 'location'
can be displayed using the DISPLAY THREAD command for type indoubt threads by including the
LOCATION('location) parameter in the command.
Information about the indoubt participant continues to appear in the DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT) report
until it is purged with the RESET INDOUBT command.
DSNL419I PARTNER location HAS RESOLVED WARM START STATUS AND CONNECTION IS ACCEPTED
Explanation: A successful warm start connection was made with a partner. A previous attempt to make a warm
start connection with the partner was rejected with a DSNL410I message because the partner specified an incorrect
log name.
location
Either the relational database name (location-name) or the logical unit name (<luname>) of the partner
System action: The connection was successful. Normal processing continues.
DSNL420I COLD START CONNECTION BY PARTICIPANT location ACCEPTED. POSSIBLE DAMAGE.  INFORMATION RECORDED IN TRACE RECORD WITH IFCID=204 AND IFCID SEQUENCE NUMBER=seq-no
Explanation: DB2 has coordinator responsibility for indoubt threads at a participant and just connected with the
participant, which lost all knowledge of indoubt threads because of a previous cold start. There might be damage at
the participant.
location
This field contains one of the following:
v The requester's relational database name (location name)
v The requester's VTAM LU name (<luname>)
v The requester's IP address
seq-no The IFCID sequence number associated with the trace record. The sequence number is printed in
hexadecimal format. If the sequence number is zero, then IFCID 204 was not active or it was active with a
destination of the resident trace table only. IFCID 204 is a member of statistics class 4, which has a default
destination of SMF.
System action: The connection with the partner is accepted. Alert A001 is generated. A trace record whose
IFCID=204 is written.
System programmer response: Call the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: DB2 is the coordinator with indoubt thread resolution responsibility for one or more
indoubt logical units of work at 'location'. The DBMS at 'location' performed a cold start. DB2 assumes that the
participant recovery log was lost or damaged and indoubt thread resolution cannot be achieved. There is probably
inconsistent data at the participant. Minimally, the participant might not completely reflect the final outcome of the
threads that were indoubt at the time the failure occurred. A list of indoubt threads involving the partner 'location'
can be displayed using the DISPLAY THREAD command for type indoubt threads by including the
LOCATION('location) parameter in the command.
Information about the indoubt participant continues to appear in the DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT) report
until it is purged with the RESET INDOUBT command.
DSNL421I SNA XLN PROTOCOL VIOLATION BY PARTNER location. INFORMATION RECORDED IN TRACE RECORD WITH IFCID=0236 AND IFCID SEQUENCE NUMBER=seq-no
Explanation: DB2 detected a protocol violation in the SNA Exchange Log Names (XLN) exchange with the partner
at the specified location.
location
Either the relational database name (location-name) or the logical unit name (<luname>) of the partner that
sent the invalid XLN message.
seq-no The IFCID sequence number associated with the trace record. The sequence number is printed in
hexadecimal format. If the sequence number is zero, then IFCID 0236 was not active or it was active with a
destination of the resident trace table only. IFCID 0236 is a member of statistics class 4, which has a default
destination of SMF.
System action: The attempt to connect with the remote site fails. DB2 writes a trace record with IFCID 0236.
Operator response: Call the system programmer.
System programmer response: Contact the system programmer for the remote site. The invalid XLN message is
recorded in the IFCID 0236 trace record. The system logic error that causes the invalid XLN message must be
corrected at the remote site.
DSNL422I WARM START CONNECTION BY PARTNER location REJECTED BECAUSE THE PARTNER REMEMBERS OUR LOG NAME INCORRECTLY. OUR LOG NAME IS name1 AND THE PARTNER REMEMBERS IT AS name2
Explanation: An attempt to make a warm start connection with a partner was rejected because the partner specified
our log name as name2. Our log name is name1, which is the LUNAME of the local DB2. This error might be a
recoverable error if the partner can restart with our log name as name1. If this is not possible, then the partner must
perform a cold start connection with DB2.
location
The 'location' with which the connection failed: either the relational database name (location-name) or the
logical unit name (<luname>) of the partner.
name1 Our log name, as remembered by us.
name2 Our log name, as remembered by our partner and sent to us in the attempted warm start connection.
System action: The connection with the partner is rejected. DB2 retains indoubt knowledge.
System programmer response: Call the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: Contact the database administrator at the partner 'location' and determine if it is
possible for the partner to perform a warm start with our log name specified as the LUNAME of this DB2. If this is
possible, the next attempt to connect will succeed.
If this cannot be done, then there are two other possible solutions.
v Have the partner 'location' perform a cold start connection with this DB2 subsystem.
v Use the RESET INDOUBT command with the FORCE option in conjunction with the LOCATION parameter to
cause the next connection with the partner to be a cold start connection.
DSNL423I AUTOMATIC RESOLUTION OF luwid=token WITH PARTICIPANT location RESULTED IN COMMIT
Explanation: The identified indoubt logical unit of work was automatically resolved through communication with
the participant location. After automatic resolution, this message is issued if message DSNL406 was previously issued
reporting the thread as indoubt. This message is not issued if message DSNL406 occurs in one restart of DDF or DB2,
and automatic resolution occurs in a different restart of DDF or DB2.
luwid=token
The global logical unit of work id and the local token that identify the thread.
location
This field contains one of the following:
v The requester's relational database name (location name)
v The requester's VTAM LU name (<luname>)
v The requester's IP address
System action: Processing continues normally.
DSNL424I AUTOMATIC RESOLUTION OF luwid=token WITH PARTICIPANT location RESULTED IN ABORT
Explanation: The identified indoubt logical unit of work was automatically resolved by communication with the
participant location. After automatic resolution, this message is issued if message DSNL425 was previously issued
reporting the thread as being indoubt. This message is not issued if message DSNL425 occurs in one restart of DDF
or DB2, and automatic resolution occurs in a different restart of DDF or DB2.
luwid=token
The global logical unit of work id and the local token that identify the thread
location
This field contains one of the following:
v The requester's relational database name (location name)
v The requester's VTAM LU name (<luname>)
v The requester's IP address
System action: Processing continues normally.
DSNL425I THREAD luwid=token AT PARTICIPANT location MAY BE INDOUBT BECAUSE OF A COMMUNICATION FAILURE. DB2 ABORTED THE THREAD. INFORMATION RECORDED IN TRACE RECORD WITH IFCID=209 AND IFCID SEQUENCE NUMBER=seq-no
Explanation: During execution of the two phase commit protocol with the participant identified by 'location',
communications failed. Phase 1 of the protocol completed with the participant and it is prepared for either commit or
abort. The decision to abort the thread was made, but cannot be communicated to the participant at this time. The
participant is indoubt.
DB2 becomes responsible for indoubt resolution with the participant. This responsibility appears in a DISPLAY
THREAD TYPE (INDOUBT) report. Periodic attempts are made to reestablish communication with the participant for
automatic indoubt resolution. If successful, message DSNL424 is written.
luwid=token
The global logical unit of work id and the local token that identify the thread.
location
This field contains one of the following:
v The requester's relational database name (location name)
v The requester's VTAM LU name (<luname>)
v The requester's IP address
seq-no The IFCID sequence number associated with the trace record. The sequence number is printed in
hexadecimal format. If the sequence number is zero, IFCID 209 was not active or it was active with a
destination of the resident trace table only. IFCID 209 is a member of statistics class 4, which has a default
destination of SMF.
System action: Alert A006 is generated. A trace record whose IFCID=209 is written.
Operator response: If message DSNL424 for the LUWID specified in message DSNL406 does not appear in a
reasonable amount of time, call the system programmer.
System programmer response: Determine the cause of the communication failure and have the problem fixed. DB2
periodically attempts to reestablish communication. If the problem cannot be fixed in a reasonable amount of time,
call the database administrator. The participant might need to resolve the indoubt state manually in order to release
locked resources.
Database Administrator Action: If the unit of work with LUWID=luwid is indoubt at 'location', inform the database
administrator there that the logical unit of work with LUWID=luwid was aborted to assist in manual resolution of
the indoubt thread at 'location'.
DSNL429I INCONSISTENT DDF LOG DATA, THE FIRST CONNECTION WITH EACH REMOTE LOCATION WILL BE A COLD START CONNECTION
Explanation: DB2 detected an inconsistency in the DB2 log during restart operations. Since the log is inconsistent
and cannot be trusted, DB2 performs a cold start connection with each partner LU the next time a connection with
that LU is attempted. If DB2 has indoubt resolution responsibility either as a coordinator or as a participant, then this
information is lost as indicated by messages DSNL438 and/or DSNL439, which might follow this message. This
means that:
v All information that DB2 maintained about having coordinator responsibility for remote participants was purged.
These remote participants need manual resolution for any indoubt threads for which DB2 was the coordinator. A DSNL439I message is displayed for each indoubt remote participant.
v All information that DB2 maintained about having participant responsibility for remote coordinators was purged.
A DSNL438I message is displayed for each database access thread that has a remote coordinator. If a database
access thread remains indoubt at the end of restart, then the thread must be manually resolved. A -DISPLAY
THREAD (*) TYPE(INDOUBT) LOCATION (*) command provides a report that lists the indoubt threads that need
manual resolution.
System action: Processing continues normally.
System programmer response: Call the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: See the DSNL438I and DSNL439I messages to determine what action to take.
DSNL432I DDF IS COORDINATOR FOR nnnn THREADS WITH mmmm INDOUBT REMOTE PARTNERS
Explanation: This message is issued when DDF is started or stopped, if DDF determines that this DB2 has
coordinator responsibility for one or more indoubt threads with one or more partners. This is a summary status
message.
nnnn The number of indoubt threads for which DB2 is the coordinator
mmmm
The number of remote partners where the threads are indoubt
System action: Processing continues normally.
Operator response: If the message was issued as a result of DDF starting, no action is necessary. If the message was
issued as a result of DDF stopping, contact the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: If the message was issued as a result of stopping DDF, then DB2 maintained all
information necessary to perform automatic resynchronization with partner locations and resolve all indoubt units of
work. Issue the START DDF command to initiate this process.
If the message was issued as a result of starting DDF, then DDF started automatic resynchronization.
DSNL433I DDF IS PARTICIPANT FOR nnnn INDOUBT THREADS WITH mmmm REMOTE PARTNERS
Explanation: This message is issued when DDF is started or stopped, if DDF determines that this DB2 has
participant responsibility for one or more indoubt threads with one or more partners. This is a summary status
message.
nnnn The number of indoubt threads for which DB2 is the participant
mmmm
The number of remote partners that have coordinator responsibility
System action: Processing continues normally.
Operator response: If the message was issued as a result of DDF starting, no action is necessary. If the message was
issued as a result of DDF stopping, contact the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: If the message was issued as a result of stopping DDF, then DB2 maintained all
information necessary to perform automatic resynchronization with partner locations and resolve all indoubt units of
work. Issue the START DDF command to initiate this process.
If you do not want to perform automatic resynchronization, you can still resolve the indoubt units of work for which
DB2 is a participant and which hold database resources locked. Use the DISPLAY THREAD command for type
indoubt threads to produce a display that lists these threads. Then use the RECOVER INDOUBT command to either
commit or abort these units of work.
To avoid data inconsistency, coordinate this manual resolution with the database administrators at the locations that
have coordinator responsibility for each indoubt unit of work. If any of the indoubt units of work at DB2 also have
coordinator responsibility for participant locations, then you should notify the database administrators at the
participant locations of the commit or abort decision so they can make the same decision.
DSNL434E DDF NOT STARTED - INCORRECT VTAM RELEASE LEVEL
Explanation: The local VTAM release level is older than the minimum release level required by DB2. When DB2
issues the VTAM OPEN macro, the VTAM release level is returned to DB2. DB2 examines the VTAM release level to
determine whether the local VTAM system provides the function required by DB2.
System action: The attempt to START DDF fails.
Operator response: Call the system programmer.
System programmer response: Install a release of VTAM that is compatible with the DB2 system. The DB2 Program
Directory identifies the required VTAM release level.
DSNL438I RESYNC STATUS PURGED FOR COORDINATOR location. LUWID=luwid, URID=urid, STATUS=s INFORMATION RECORDED IN TRACE RECORD WITH IFCID=235 and IFCID SEQUENCE NUMBER=seq-no
Explanation: The information related to resynchronization with the remote coordinator location for the logical unit
of work identified by 'luwid', which is displayed in this message, is being purged by DB2. Automatic indoubt
resolution responsibility for this distributed logical unit of work can no longer be performed.
This situation can arise in one of two ways;
v A DB2 conditional restart (other than a DB2 cold start; that is, a DB2 conditional restart with
STARTRBA=ENDRBA) is being performed.
v An inconsistency in the DB2 log was detected during DB2 restart processing (indicated by a DSNL429I message).
location
This field contains one of the following:
v The requester's relational database name (location name)
v The requester's VTAM LU name (<luname>)
v The requester's IP address
luwid The global logical unit of work id that identifies the logical unit of work.
urid The unit of recovery identifier. This is the RBA on the DB2 recovery log of the log record that marks the
beginning of the logical unit of work. This is the earliest RBA required to process the logical unit of work
during restart.
s Restart status of the logical unit of work. When DB2 came down, the logical unit of work was in one of
these states:
A INABORT: The logical unit of work was in the must-complete phase of abort, but abort has not
yet completed.
C INCOMMIT: The logical unit of work was in the must-complete phase of commit, but commit
has not yet completed.
D INDOUBT: The logical unit of work completed the first phase of commit, but DB2 has not yet
received the commit or abort decision from the coordinator.
F INFLIGHT: The logical unit of work has not yet completed the first phase of commit and should be
backed out.
U UNKNOWN: The status of the logical unit of work is not known to DB2 because of conditional
restart.
seq-no The IFCID sequence number associated with the trace record. The trace record is written to statistics class 4,
which is started to SMF as a default during DB2 installation. Statistics class 4 must be started to a
permanent destination (SMF or GTF) for the trace record to be accessible. The sequence number is printed in
hexadecimal.
System action: Processing continues normally.
System programmer response: Call the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: The resynchronization information that was purged by DB2 is recorded in this
message. To determine the proper commit or abort decision made by the coordinator at 'location', use the status code
as follows:
A The correct decision is to abort the logical unit of work.
C The correct decision is to commit the logical unit of work.
D Contact the database administrator at 'location' to determine the correct decision.
F The correct decision is to abort the logical unit of work.
U Contact the database administrator at 'location' to determine the correct decision.
DSNL439I RESYNC STATUS PURGED FOR PARTICIPANT location. LUWID=luwid, URID=urid, STATUS=s INFORMATION RECORDED IN TRACE RECORD WITH IFCID=235 and IFCID SEQUENCE NUMBER=seq-no
Explanation: DB2 is purging the information related to resynchronization with the remote participant location for
the logical unit of work identified by 'luwid', which is displayed in this message. Automatic indoubt resolution
responsibility for this distributed logical unit of work can no longer be performed.
This situation can arise in one of two ways:
v A DB2 conditional restart (other than a DB2 cold start; that is, a DB2 conditional restart with
STARTRBA=ENDRBA) is being performed.
v An inconsistency in the DB2 log was detected during DB2 restart processing (indicated by a DSNL429I message).
location
This field contains one of the following:
v The requester's relational database name (location name)
v The requester's VTAM LU name (<luname>)
v The requester's IP address
luwid The global logical unit of work id that identifies the logical unit of work.
urid The unit of recovery identifier. This is the RBA on the DB2 recovery log of the log record that marks the
beginning of the logical unit of work. This is the earliest RBA required to process the logical unit of work
during restart.
s Restart status of the logical unit of work. When DB2 came down, the logical unit of work was in one of
these states:
A INABORT: The logical unit of work was in the must-complete phase of abort, but abort has not
yet completed.
C INCOMMIT: The logical unit of work was in the must-complete phase of commit, but commit
has not yet completed.
D INDOUBT: The logical unit of work completed the first phase of commit, but DB2 has not yet
received the commit or abort decision from the coordinator.
F INFLIGHT: The logical unit of work has not yet completed the first phase of commit and should be
backed out.
U UNKNOWN: The status of the logical unit of work is not known to DB2 because of conditional
restart.
seq-no The IFCID sequence number associated with the trace record. The trace record is written to statistics class 4,
which is started to SMF as a default during DB2 installation. Statistics class 4 must be started to a
permanent destination (SMF or GTF) for the trace record to be accessible. The sequence number is printed in
hexadecimal.
System action: Processing continues normally.
System programmer response: Call the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: The resynchronization information that was purged by DB2 is recorded in this
message. When communicating the proper commit or abort decision to the database administrator at 'location', use
the status code as follows:
A Abort the logical unit of work.
C Commit the logical unit of work.
D See the DSNL438I message produced for the same 'luwid' and 'urid' to determine the coordinator 'location'.
Contact the database administrator at 'location' to determine the correct decision.
F Abort the logical unit of work.
U If there is a DSNL438I message for the same 'luwid' and 'urid', proceed as described above under 'D'.
Otherwise, there might be information available on the DB2 log that a DSN1LOGP summary report can
provide. If this is not successful, contact the IBM Support Center.
DSNL440I csect-name RESET INDOUBT COMMAND SPECIFICATION IN ERROR
Explanation: A RESET INDOUBT command was issued, but the specification of keywords or keyword parameter
values was in error.
System action: No indoubt information was purged. System processing continues normally.
User response: One of the following errors was made in the RESET INDOUBT command specification:
v RESET INDOUBT was issued without any other keywords specified. At least one of the following keywords must
also be specified: LUNAME, IPADDR, LOCATION, or LUWID.
v RESET INDOUBT was issued with both the LUWID and LOCATION keywords specified, but a list of LOCATION
keyword parameter values was specified. When both the LUWID and LOCATION keywords are specified only one
LOCATION keyword parameter value is allowed.
v RESET INDOUBT was issued with at least one LOCATION keyword parameter value that began with a '<', but
did not end with a '>', or the length of the bracketed value was not 1 to 8 characters. When the LOCATION
keyword parameter value is specified in the <luname> format, the luname value must be bracketed with '<' and '>'
and be 1 to 8 characters long.
v RESET INDOUBT was issued with an invalid IPADDR keyword parameter. Verify that the specified IPADDRs are
in the proper form, that there is a double period delimiter (..) between the IPADDR and port, and that the port
number is valid.
If needed, issue the DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT) command to display information (including LOCATION,
LUWID, and LUNAME values) about all indoubt threads. Correct the RESET INDOUBT command specification, and
reissue the command.
DSNL441I KEYWORD 'LUWID' PARAMETER VALUE parmvalue FORMAT IN ERROR
Explanation: A RESET INDOUBT command with the LUWID parameter was issued, but the specified parameter
value (parmvalue) has an invalid format for an LUWID. There are two correct formats for the LUWID parameter. The
first correct format is called a token, and is a 1 to 5 digit decimal number. The second correct format is
'netid.luname.luwunique.comseq', where:
netid A 1 to 8 character network ID
luname
A 1 to 8 character luname
luwunique
A 12 character hexadecimal number
comseq
A 4 character hexadecimal number
All fields in the second correct format must be separated by a period (.) delimiter.
System action: Indoubt information about the specified logical unit of work is not purged from the system.
User response: To determine the correct LUWID value for the unit of work indoubt information that you want to
purge, issue the DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT) command to display all units of work for which indoubt
information exists. Then reissue the RESET INDOUBT command, specifying the correct LUWID parameter value.
DSNL442I QUALIFYING INDOUBT INFORMATION FOR LOCATION location NOT FOUND
Explanation: A -RESET INDOUBT LOCATION('location') command was issued, but DB2 has no indoubt
information about the specified location.
location
The value specified after the LOCATION keyword in the RESET INDOUBT command.
System action: No indoubt information was purged. System processing continues normally.
User response: Use the -DISPLAY THREAD(*) TYPE(INDOUBT) LOCATION(*) command to list the locations for
which DB2 has indoubt information. After determining the correct location, reissue the command.
DSNL443I QUALIFYING INDOUBT INFORMATION FOR LUWID=value NOT FOUND
Explanation: A -RESET INDOUBT LUWID('value') command was issued where 'value' is either an luwid or the
local token that represents an luwid. Either DB2 has no indoubt information about the specified luwid or token, or
DB2 has indoubt information that cannot be purged using the -RESET INDOUBT command with the LUWID option.
value The global logical unit of work id or the local token that was specified for the LUWID keyword in the
RESET INDOUBT command.
System action: No indoubt information was purged. System processing continues normally.
User response: Use the -DISPLAY THREAD(*) TYPE(INDOUBT) LOCATION(*) command to list the indoubt
information known to DB2. If the -DISPLAY THREAD output does not include information about the specified
luwid, then that is the reason the message was issued. If the -DISPLAY THREAD output does include information
about the specified luwid, this information cannot be purged using the -RESET INDOUBT command with the
LUWID option. Refer to the description of each message produced by the -DISPLAY THREAD output that relates to
the specified luwid in order to determine how to proceed. After determining the correct luwid or token, reissue the
command.
DSNL444I QUALIFYING INDOUBT INFORMATION FOR LOCATION location HAS BEEN PURGED
Explanation: A -RESET INDOUBT LOCATION('location') command issued to purge indoubt information about the
named location completed successfully and the indoubt information was purged.
location
Either the relational database name (location-name) or the logical unit name (<luname>) that was specified
after the LOCATION keyword on the RESET INDOUBT command.
System action: The specified indoubt information was purged. System processing continues normally.
DSNL445I QUALIFYING INDOUBT INFORMATION FOR LUWID value HAS BEEN PURGED
Explanation: A -RESET INDOUBT LUWID('value') command, which was issued to purge indoubt information about
the specified luwid, completed successfully. The indoubt information was purged.
value The value specified for the LUWID keyword in the -RESET INDOUBT LUWID(value) command that is
being processed.
System action: System processing continues normally.
DSNL446I COLD START WILL BE PERFORMED WITH nettype netvalue
Explanation: A -RESET INDOUBT LUNAME('luname') FORCE or a -RESET INDOUBT IPADDR('ipaddr') FORCE
command issued to force a cold start completed successfully. The next connection with 'luname' or 'ipaddr' is a cold
start.
nettype
Identifies the type of network used to access the remote site. There are two possible values:
LU -- indicates that VTAM is used to connect to the remote site.
IPADDR --
indicates that TCP/IP is used to connect to the remote site.
netvalue
The network address of the remote location. netvalue can be blank.
v If nettype is LU, netvalue specifies the VTAM LU name of the remote location.
v If nettype is IPADDR, netvalue specifies the IP address of the remote location.
System action: System processing continues normally.
DSNL447I CANNOT DELETE ENTRY value BECAUSE THERE IS AN INDOUBT THREAD TO BE RESOLVED FIRST
Explanation: A -RESET INDOUBT command was issued with LUNAME(value), IPADDR(value), LOCATION(value),
or LUWID(value). The value is an LU name, an IP address, a location, or a LUWID (or its token), that identifies a
logical unit of work for which DB2 has participant indoubt resolution responsibility, coordinator indoubt resolution
responsibility, or both.
System action: Resynchronization responsibility information was not purged. System processing continues normally.
User response: Use the information in this section to determine the correct action to take. Then issue the proper
command to perform that action.
The two most probable causes for the problem are that the -RESET INDOUBT command was issued with the wrong
parameters, or that an incorrect 'value' was specified. Use the -DISPLAY THREAD(*) TYPE(INDOUBT) LOCATION(*)
command to display the indoubt information known to DB2.
1. If the intent was to purge participant or coordinator indoubt resolution responsibility, then examine the -DISPLAY
THREAD output (DSNV401) to determine the location name, or names, for which this responsibility is to be
purged. Then use the -RESET INDOUBT LUNAME(luname) command with the FORCE option or the -RESET
INDOUBT IPADDR(ip-address) command with the FORCE option to purge this responsibility.
To determine the luname or IP address and resync port for an upstream coordinator that can be used with the
FORCE option, look at the coordinator information after the DSNV406I message in the -DISPLAY THREAD
output. There are two tokens associated with the coordinator information that are delimited by a dash (-) for SNA
connections, and by a double period (..) for TCP/IP connections.
v The first token is the partner location name or "<luname>" for an SNA connection, or the IP address for the
TCP/IP connection.
v The second token is the partner LU name for an SNA connection, or the resync port number for a TCP/IP
connection.
To determine the luname or IP address and resync port for downstream participants that can be used with the
FORCE option, look at the location names after the V444 message and in the V450 message in the DISPLAY
THREAD output (DSNV401). There are two or three tokens associated with the participant location.
v The first token is the partner location name.
v The second token is the partner LU name for an SNA connection, or the IP address for a TCP/IP connection.
The second token is delimited from the first token by a dash (-).
v The third token is the partner resync port number. The third token appears only if the second token is an IP
address, and is delimited from the second token by a double period (..).
Remember that the FORCE option causes DB2 to purge all knowledge of indoubt resolution responsibility
involving the LUNAME or IPADDR values specified in the command.
Use caution when using the FORCE parameter to purge participant indoubt information when no errors are
precluding automatic resolution. Normally, after the use of the RECOVER INDOUBT command, automatic
resolution with the coordinator determines if heuristic damage occurred. This detection is lost if RESET
INDOUBT is used before automatic resolution with the coordinator can be achieved.
Use caution when using the FORCE parameter to purge coordinator indoubt information when no errors are
precluding automatic resolution. Once the information is purged, any participant that is indoubt is forced to use a
heuristic decision process to resolve the indoubt logical unit of work.
2. Examine the -DISPLAY THREAD output. If the value specified in the command (and displayed in the DSNL447I
message) is incorrect, determine the correct value and reissue the command using the correct value.

DSNL448I UNABLE TO FORCE COLD START WITH nettype netvalue, SESSION STILL EXISTS
Explanation: A -RESET INDOUBT LUNAME('luname') FORCE or a -RESET INDOUBT IPADDR('ipaddr') FORCE
command was issued to force a cold start, but network connections still exist between DB2 and the partner 'luname'
or 'ipaddr'. The information related to this partner was not purged, so a cold start is not performed.
nettype
Identifies the type of network used to access the remote site. There are two possible values:
LU -- indicates that VTAM is used to connect to the remote site.
IPADDR --
indicates that TCP/IP is used to connect to the remote site.
netvalue
The network address of the remote location. netvalue can be blank.
v If nettype is LU, netvalue specifies the VTAM LU name of the remote location.
v If nettype is IPADDR, netvalue specifies the IP address of the remote location.
System action: System processing continues normally.
User response: For SNA, you can use the VTAM command DISPLAY NET to determine the existence of sessions
between two logical units. Terminate the sessions by using the VTAM command VARY NET,TERM to allow the
RESET INDOUBT to occur. For TCP/IP, terminate all connections to the IP address.Determine the correct luname or
ipaddr and reissue the command.
DSNL449I DB2 HAS NO INFORMATION RELATED TO LUNAME luname
Explanation: A -RESET INDOUBT LUNAME('luname') FORCE command was issued but DB2 has no knowledge of
the specified 'luname'.
luname
The logical unit name, as defined to VTAM, of the coordinator or participant
System action: No information was purged. System processing continues normally.
User response: Determine the correct luname as follows:
v Use the -DISPLAY THREAD(*) TYPE(INDOUBT) LOCATION(*) command to determine locations for which DB2
has indoubt responsibility.
v Query the SYSIBM.LOCATIONS table to correlate a location name with an luname. The LINKNAME column
contains the luname associated with the location name in the LOCATION column.
Then reissue the command, specifying the correct luname.
DSNL450I DDF THREAD luwid=token IS BETWEEN PHASE 1 AND PHASE 2 OF COMMIT. THREAD IS NOW AN INDOUBT THREAD AS A RESULT OF CANCEL REQUEST.
Explanation: The identified DDF thread was in a prepared state waiting for the commit or backout decision of the
commit coordinator. The thread cannot be canceled in this state. However, the thread was removed from the active
state and placed into the indoubt state. The conversation with the coordinator was deallocated. The thread is now
indoubt and appears in the display thread report for indoubt threads. The resources held by the thread continue to
be held. Automatic resolution of the indoubt state is attempted periodically. Resources held by the thread are released
after indoubt resolution occurs.
luwid=token
The global logical unit of work id and the local token that identify the thread
System action: Processing continues normally.
Operator response: If the purpose of canceling this thread was to free the resources held by the thread, call the
database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: To release the resources held by the indoubt thread before automatic resolution with
the coordinator, a manual commit or abort decision can be made with the RECOVER INDOUBT command. First,
issue the DISPLAY THREAD command for an indoubt thread report, which includes the subject thread. From this
report, determine the name of the coordinator. Contact the coordinator system and find out whether a commit or
abort decision was made.
DSNL451I QUALIFYING INDOUBT INFORMATION FOR LUNAME luname NOT FOUND
Explanation: A -RESET INDOUBT LUNAME('luname') command was issued, but DB2 has no indoubt information
about the specified luname.
luname
The logical unit name, as defined to VTAM, of the coordinator or participant
System action: No indoubt information was purged. System processing continues normally.
User response: Use the -DISPLAY THREAD(*) TYPE(INDOUBT) LOCATION(*) command to list the locations for
which DB2 has indoubt information. Entries associated with a particular LUNAME have a location name in this
form: '<luname>'. Use 'luname' (without the enclosing brackets) as the input string to RECOVER INDOUBT.
After determining the correct luname, reissue the command.
DSNL452I QUALIFYING INDOUBT INFORMATION FOR LUNAME luname HAS BEEN PURGED
Explanation: A -RESET INDOUBT LUNAME('luname') command, which was issued to purge indoubt information
about the specified luname completed successfully. The indoubt information was purged.
luname
The luname specified for the LUNAME keyword in the -RESET INDOUBT LUNAME(luname) command
being processed.
System action: The specified indoubt information was purged. System processing continues normally.

about the specified IP address.
csect The CSECT name of the DB2 module that issued the message
ipaddr The IP address of the coordinator or participant.
System action: No indoubt information was purged. System processing continues normally.
User response: Use the -DISPLAY THREAD(*) TYPE(INDOUBT) LOCATION(*) command to list the locations for
which DB2 has indoubt information. Entries associated with TCP/IP have a string with this format in the
LOCATION field: "nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn".
After determining the correct ipaddr, reissue the command.
DSNL454I csect QUALIFYING INDOUBT INFORMATION FOR IP ADDRESS ipaddr HAS BEEN PURGED
Explanation: A -RESET INDOUBT IPADDR('ipaddr') command, which was issued to purge indoubt information
about the specified IP address completed successfully. The indoubt information was purged.
csect The CSECT name of the DB2 module that issued the message
ipaddr The IP address specified for the IPADDR keyword in the -RESET INDOUBT IPADDR(ipaddr) command
being processed
System action: The specified indoubt information was purged. System processing continues normally.

Explanation: A -RESET INDOUBT IPADDR('ipaddr') FORCE command was issued but DB2 has no knowledge of
the specified 'ipaddr'.
csect The CSECT name of the DB2 module that issued the message.
ipaddr The IP address of the coordinator or participant.
System action: No information was purged. System processing continues normally.
User response: Determine the correct luname as follows:
v Use the -DISPLAY THREAD(*) TYPE(INDOUBT) LOCATION(*) command to determine locations for which DB2
has indoubt responsibility. Entries associated with TCP/IP locations specify "nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn" in the LOCATION
field.
Reissue the command; specify the correct ipaddr.

DSNL511I csect-name TCP/IP CONVERSATION FAILED TO LOCATION location-name IPADDR=ip-address PORT=port SOCKET=socket RETURN CODE=return-code REASON CODE=reason-code
Explanation: A TCP/IP socket call failed with the error condition identified by the return code and reason code.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
location-name
The location name associated with the remote site.
ip-address
The IP address of the remote site.
port The TCP/IP port used by the remote site.
socket The TCP/IP socket call that returned the error.
return-code
The error condition reported by TCP/IP, as a decimal number. This code is issued by z/OS UNIX System
Services or z/OS Communications Server.
A 3448 return code condition is typically related to a TCP/IP DROP-related event, such as the result of a
TCP/IP DROP command. DB2 also uses a TCP/IP DROP service for various cancel-related events, which
might include the z/OS CANCEL command, the DB2 CANCEL THREAD command, or DB2 idle-thread
timeout conditions.
reason-code
Further detail associated with the TCP/IP return code, as a hexadecimal number. This code is issued by
z/OS UNIX System Services or z/OS Communications Server.
The following values together indicate a zero-length receive, which is considered a closed condition:
v SOCKET=RECV
v RETURN CODE=0
v REASON CODE=00000000
System action: Communication on the conversation is discontinued.

DSNL512I csect-name TCP/IP socket FAILED WITH RETURN CODE=return-code AND REASON CODE=reason-code
Explanation: A TCP/IP socket call used to establish communication between DB2 and TCP/IP failed.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
socket The name of the TCP/IP socket call that failed.
return-code
The return code reported by TCP/IP, as a decimal number. This code is issued by z/OS UNIX System
Services or z/OS Communications Server.
reason-code
The reason code reported by TCP/IP, as a hexadecimal number. This code is issued by z/OS UNIX System
Services or z/OS Communications Server.
System action: DB2 will periodically retry the socket call to establish TCP/IP communication.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: The response is based on the TCP/IP socket call that failed.
socket=GETHOSTNAME
socket=GETNAMEINFO(ip-address)
socket=GETADDRINFO(host-name)
The GetHostName, GetNameInfo, or GetAddrInfo call has failed.
During DDF initialization, DB2 first determines its host name using a GetHostName socket call. DB2 must
then determine its IP address. If an IP address is specified in the BSDS using the DSNJU003 utility, or on the
PORT statement in the TCP/IP profile, then DB2 uses this IP address. Otherwise, DB2 executes a
GetAddrInfo(host-name) socket call, using the host-name that was returned on the prior GetHostName socket
call, which returns the first IP address listed in the name server or local host table.
Important: The host name or IP address returned could depend on the selected TCP/IP stack, in the event
that there are multiple TCP/IP stacks. DB2 requires z/OS UNIX System Services sockets, and it is z/OS
UNIX System Services that determines the TCP/IP stack to use. z/OS UNIX System Services provides a way
for users to select a specific TCP/IP stack by using the BPXTCAFF utility.
DB2 then issues a GetNameInfo socket call to determine the domain name associated with the derived IP
address.
The z/OS Resolver handles the GetNameInfo socket call because DB2 uses the z/OS UNIX System Services
Asynchronous Sockets interface. This resolver uses the resolver configuration information available to DDF.
Until this information for the selected TCP/IP is correctly specified for DDF, the z/OS Resolver will be
unable to determine the domain name for DDF. You can find the search order for the resolver configuration
files for a z/OS application, such as DDF, in the IP Configuration manual for the appropriate level of the
Communication Server for your z/OS operating system.
socket=GETHOSTNAME
DB2 DDF initialization invoked a TCP/IP GetHostName socket call in order to determine the host
name associated to TCP/IP, and hence the host name associated with the DB2 subsystem. However,
the call failed and DB2 is not able to determine the host name. DB2 retries the socket call
periodically.
socket=GETNAMEINFO(ip-address)
DB2 invoked a TCP/IP GetNameInfo socket call to determine the domain name for the specified IP
address. However, the call failed and DB2 is not able to determine the domain name. DB2 retries
the socket call periodically.
socket=GETADDRINFO(host-name)
DB2 invoked a TCP/IP GetAddrInfo socket call to determine the IP address associated with the
specified host name. However, the call failed and DB2 is not able to determine the IP address. DB2
retries the socket call periodically.
If you want a BSDS-specified IP address, correct the BSDS. This requires you to stop and restart
DB2. Otherwise, verify that the provided host name is correct and take the appropriate action:
v If the host name is incorrect, correct the host name in the appropriate resolver configuration file,
refresh TCP/IP, and then stop and start DDF so that the new host name is refreshed for DDF
initialization.
v If the host name is correct, then TCP/IP is unable to resolve the host name to an IP address. You
must make changes in order to allow for proper host name to IP address resolution. If the
changes have been made to the name server or local host table, refresh the resolver.
socket=POLL
The online ZPARM was changed using the SET SYSPARM command, changing the MAXDBAT from a
positive value to zero. In this case, the message is informational, indicating that DB2 terminated its TCP/IP
listening capability for SQL related work because DB2 can no longer accept SQL related connections from
remote partners when MAXDBAT is set to zero.
socket=SHUTDOWN_REG (USS_UNAVAILABLE)
The z/OS UNIX System Services (USS/OMVS) environment is not available. DDF start processing continues
and this message is periodically repeated until the Unix System Services environment becomes available or
DDF is stopped. You can use the z/OS "F OMVS, RESTART" command to start the z/OS UNIX System
Services environment.
socket=SETRLIMIT and reason code=1148033C
You should define DB2 as a superuser. For instructions on how to enable DDF as a superuser, see the
information about enabling DDF for UNIX System Services.
socket=TCPKEEPALIVE
DB2 issues this socket call as a result of the TCP/IP KeepAlive value specified in the DB2 parameters
module (usually DSNZPARM). You may specify this value by the TCP/IP KEEPALIVE value in the
DSNTIP5 installation panel. Another way to specify the value is through the TCPKPALV value in the
DSN6FAC macro, used to build the DB2 parameters module.
In this situation, processing continues, and DB2 does not retry the socket call. Verify that the TCP/IP stack
being used by DB2 contains the required companion support for this function. If not, modify the DB2
parameter module to prevent DB2 from attempting to override the TCP/IP stack value.
socket=BSDS_ERROR (ADDRESS_ON_PORT_STMT)
An IP address is specified in both the BSDS and the PORT statement of the TCP/ IP profile. An address
should be specified in only one place. That is, DB2 detected that IP addresses have been specified in the
BSDS (through the IPV4, GRPIPV4, IPV6, and GRPIPV6 keywords of the DSNJU003 Change Log Inventory
utility) and also in the TCP/IP profile on the PORT statement for the port value to be used by this
subsystem. Only one of the specifications can now have IP addresses. The DB2 TCP/IP environment will not
initialize, and the error is periodically repeated until the error is corrected.
One of the IP address specifications must be removed from the BSDS or from the TCP/IP profile. However,
the BSDS specification should be retained because the recommendation is to use BSDS specifications to
define the IP addresses that are to be associated to DB2, and, because removing the BSDS specifications
would require DB2 to be stopped. In this case, to allow the initialization of the DB2 TCP/IP environment to
continue. The TCP/IP profile PORT statement can be changed to remove the IP addresses and then the
changed specifications can be dynamically brought on-line, which favors the BSDS specifications.
socket=BSDS_ERROR (IPv6_REQUIRES_DUALMODE_STACK)
A member or subsystem, or possibly a group, IPv6 address is specified in the BSDS without TCP/IP dual
mode stack enabled. DB2 ignores all IPv6 addresses defined in the BSDS and DDF start-processing continues
normally.
You should either enable a dual mode stack or delete all of the BSDS-defined IPv6 addresses and use only
IPv4 addresses.
socket=BINDSPECIFIC NOT SUPPORT WITH SECURE PORT
A secure port was specified in the BSDS but an IP address is simultaneously defined on the PORT statement
in the TCP/IP profile (PROFILE.TCPIP).
DDF supports secure ports only when it is listening on the INADDR_ANY.
socket=DVIPA ACTIVATION(ip-address)
The specified IP address cannot be activated as a VIPARANGE DVIPA. DB2 does not know whether the
specified IP address was intended to be used as a DVIPA. If it was intended to be used as a DVIPA, correct
the error and recycle DDF to activate it. However, if the IP address was not intended to be used as a DVIPA,
ignore this message.
socket=EZBNMIF4_DROPCON
DB2 invoked the TCP/IP EZBNMIF4 (EZBNMIFR) service to drop a connection. The call failed but DB2
processing continues. DB2 periodically issues the message until the error is corrected. Refer to Using the
EZBNMIFR requests (z/OS Communications Server: IP Programmer's Guide and Reference) for an
explanation of the return and reason code values.
The most common cause for the failure is a return code value of 111 (EACCES) and a reason code value of
77E800DC (JRSAFNotAuthorized). This return and reason code indicates that TCP/IP determined that RACF
security profiles were not defined to permit DB2 to use the service. The user ID that is associated with the
ssnmDIST started task requires CONTROL access to the MVS.VARY.TCPIP.DROP command for the
OPERCMDS class. Refer to Enabling DDF for UNIX System Services and TCP/IP (DB2 Installation and
Migration) for more information.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Determine the meaning of the return and reason codes issued by z/OS UNIX System
Services or z/OS Communications Server.

System programmer response: If the value specified by serv is incorrect, correct the PORT column value in
SYSIBM.LOCATIONS.
If the value specified by serv is correct, register the service name with TCP/IP.
TCP/IP service names are case sensitive, so make sure that the PORT column in SYSIBM.LOCATIONS is an exact
match for the service name defined to TCP/IP.

System action: The request fails. DB2 will continue to try to activate the TCP/IP port number periodically.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If this error occurs for the TCP/IP port that is used for incoming DRDA requests,
the error is probably caused by DB2 restarting on a CEC that already has another DB2 subsystem using the DRDA
port number.
If this error occurs for a TCP/IP port that is used for incoming DRDA requests to an ALIAS, the error is probably
caused by some of the reasons that an error would occur for the normal DRDA request port. Check to ensure that the
port value was also not previously reserved for another application in the system's TCP/IP profile.
Define the TCP/IP port number used by DB2 to the TCP/IP instance, or use the change log inventory utility to
correct the TCP/IP port number used by DB2.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Determine the meaning of the return and reason codes issued by z/OS UNIX System
Services or z/OS Communications Server.

DSNL516I csect-name LANGUAGE ENVIRONMENT SERVICES NOT AVAILABLE. CEEPIPI ROUTINE CANNOT BE LOADED
Explanation: DB2 must load the Language Environment interface module (CEEPIPI) to process functions requiring
Language Environment services. These Language Environment services are required for TCP/IP socket calls,
encryption and decryption, and so on. If the CEEPIPI module is not included in an accessible data set such as
STEPLIB data sets or the LPA library, DDF is unable to use the Language Environment.
System action: DDF startup continues, but DDF users cannot use DB2 functions that require Language Environment
services.
System programmer response: Add the Language Environment library to the DDF STEPLIB concatenation or to the
LPA library. The Language Environment library must be APF authorized when it appears in the DDF STEPLIB
concatenation.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic item listed in
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.

System programmer response: See Problem Determination.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
If the function requested by DB2 was add-entry(module-name), an incorrect link edit of the module could create
unresolved references. To determine if link edit problems exist, run the z/OS AMBLIST utility with LISTLOAD and
OUTPUT=XREF.

port, a resync port or an alias port.
System action: DDF is available to accept incoming requests on the specified IP address and port. If the IP address
is specified on the PORT statement of the TCPIP profile, DB2 accepts connections only on the specified IP address. If
the IP address is specified by either the DSNJU003 utility or the MODIFY DDF command, DB2 accepts connections
on any IP address active on the stack, including the specified IP address, regardless of whether a domain name is
provided or not.
This message is issued each time that the listener is re-initialized to accept requests for the specified IP address and
port.
System programmer response: If you want DB2 to accept connections on any IP address, including the specified IP
address, then the IP address must be specified in the BSDS. Specifying a domain name is optional when the IP
address is specified in the BSDS.

DSNM001I IMS/TM xxxx CONNECTED TO SUBSYSTEM yyyy
Explanation: This is an information message only. The control region of the IMS/TM system specified in the
message as 'xxxx' has successfully connected to the DB2 subsystem specified in the message as 'yyyy'. The message is
sent to the IMS/TM master terminal operator.
System action: IMS/TM transactions can access DB2 resources.
DSNM002I IMS/TM xxxx DISCONNECTED FROM SUBSYSTEM yyyy RC=rc
Explanation: The IMS/TM system named 'xxxx' control region has disconnected from the DB2 subsystem named
'yyyy' for the RC, reason code, of 'rc'. The message is sent to the IMS/TM master terminal operator. The reason code
values are:
Value Description
A IMS/TM is terminating normally (for example, /CKPT FREEZE command).
B IMS/TM is terminating abnormally.
C DB2 is terminating in a quiesce fashion (for example, DB2 stop quiesce command).
D DB2 is terminating abnormally.
E The connection between IMS/TM and the DB2 subsystem is terminating; however, both subsystems remain
operational.
System action: The connection between IMS/TM and DB2 terminated. IMS/TM transactions can no longer access
DB2 resources.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Reason code A, C, or E makes this an information message. Reason code D indicates
that a serious problem occurred in the DB2 subsystem, and that the SYS1.LOGREC should be examined. For reason
code B or D, determine the failing subcomponent.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: SYS1.LOGREC and/or dump information may be available for reason codes B and D.
DSNM003I IMS/TM ims/tm-name FAILED TO CONNECT TO SUBSYSTEM subsystem-name RC=return-code
Explanation: The IMS/TM system (named ims/tm-name) control region did not connect to the DB2 subsystem
(named subsystem-name). This message is sent to the IMS/TM master terminal operator. The return-code value
indicates the reason for the failure.
Value Description
00 The DB2 subsystem is not operational. However, a notify message has been queued and, when the DB2
subsystem is started, it will automatically connect to IMS/TM.
04 The connection attempt failed between IMS/TM and the DB2 subsystem.
System action: IMS/TM transactions cannot access DB2 resources.
Operator response: For return code 00, start the DB2 subsystem. For return code 04, notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: For return code 04, an IMS/TM attachment facility snap record (code X'5501FF') is written
to the IMS/TM log to indicate the reason for the failure.

DSNM004I RESOLVE INDOUBT ENTRY(S) ARE OUTSTANDING FOR SUBSYSTEM subsystem-identifier
Explanation: The subsystem-identifier subsystem has remaining indoubt entries after the IMS/TM subsystem has
attempted to resolve the work units that are indoubt. This message is sent to the IMS/TM master terminal operator.
System action: The connection between the DB2 and IMS/TM subsystems remains active, and applications can
access DB2 resources.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Use the DISPLAY THREAD and RECOVER INDOUBT commands to display and
resolve the work units that are indoubt.
Problem determination: Recovery information is available on the DB2 log and IMS/TM log to assist in the
resolution of the work unit(s) indoubt. For each indoubt work unit, an IMS/TM attachment facility snap record (code
X'5501FE') is written to the IMS/TM log.

DSNM005I IMS/TM RESOLVE INDOUBT PROTOCOL PROBLEM WITH SUBSYSTEM subsystem-identifier
Explanation: The subsystem-identifier subsystem has protocol incompatibilities with IMS/TM. The DB2 resolve
indoubt process received an unknown or invalid recovery request (RRE) from IMS/TM. The request was rejected by
DB2 and kept by IMS/TM. The message is sent to the IMS/TM master terminal operator.
System action: The connection between the DB2 and IMS/TM subsystems remains active, and applications can
access DB2 resources.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Call the support center after extracting from the IMS/TM log the IMS/TM
attachment facility snap records (code X'5501FE') using the IMS/TM utility DFSERA10.
These records contain the complete request from IMS/TM to DB2, the request type is at offset X'01C', this is a
four-character identifier which should contain any of the following words:
v 'SHOW'
v 'IDBT'
v 'COMM'
v 'ABRT'
If the IMS/TM recovery request (RRE) found in the log is an invalid one, (not 'COMM' or 'ABRT'), you may
manually delete it using the IMS/TM/CHANGE SUBSYS RESET command after consulting with the IBM Software
Support.
If the IMS/TM request is a valid one (abort or commit), you must find the action that IMS/TM performed for that
RRE by locating the X'3730' (commit) or X'3801' (abort) record in the IMS/TM log and perform the same action under
DB2 by using the -RECOVER INDOUBT command.
Problem determination: Recovery information is available on the DB2 log and IMS log to assist in the resolution of
the problem. For each indoubt work unit, an IMS/TM attachment facility snap record (code X'5501FE') is written to
the IMS/TM log.

DSNM100I SUBSYSTEM xxxx NOT AVAILABLE
Explanation: The IMS/TM command facility which routes commands to the DB2 subsystem cannot perform its
functions because the DB2 subsystem named 'xxxx' is considered not operational.
System action: The connection to the DB2 subsystem failed for the command. The command is rejected.
System programmer response: If the DB2 subsystem is operational, and if you suspect an error in DB2, you might
need to report the problem.For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data
(Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference. The person entering the request may not be authorized to
execute the command. If the DB2 subsystem is not operational, DB2 commands from IMS/TM cannot be processed.
Problem determination: A snap record (X'5501FF') is written to the IMS/TM log if a connection request failed.
DSNM104I xxxx COMMAND FAILED
Explanation: The DB2 command specified by xxxx failed to complete.
System action: The command terminated without providing an output message. Commands will still be allowed by
the IMS/TM attachment facility.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: If the command failed because of an abend, a snap record (X'5501FF') is written to the
IMS/TM log and SYS1.LOGREC information is available.
DSNP001I csect-name - data-set-name IS WITHIN n BYTES OF AVAILABLE SPACE. RC=reason-code CONNECTION-ID=connection-identifier, CORRELATION-ID=correlation-identifier, LUW-ID=logical-unitof- work-id=token
Explanation: This message warns of an impending space shortage. The data space manager (DSM) extend function
CSECT 'DSNPmmmm' detected the space shortage through the use of a 'hedge' quantity n. Reason code reason-code
gives some information about why space could not be obtained.
There might also be some preceding DSM and VSAM messages that can help to determine why space cannot be
obtained. The connection, correlation, and logical-unit-of-work IDs identify the user or application that encountered
the problem. Correlation IDs beginning with '0nn', where nnis a number, identify system agents.
A LUW-ID of an asterisk (*) indicates that the thread does not have a LUW-ID. If the LUW-ID is not an asterisk (*),
the value is a logical-unit-of-work identifier that is assigned to the thread followed by an equals (=) sign and a token
value, which can be used in place of logical-unit-of-work-id in any DB2 command that accepts logical-unit-of-work-id
as input.
Messages that have the same connection ID, correlation ID, and LUW-ID relate to the same user. This makes it
possible to scan a number of DSNP-prefixed messages and group activities involving a given user.
System action: If sufficient space is available for the current request, continue. Otherwise, message DSNP007I
follows, and the current SQL request fails.
Operator response: DSM messages are directed to the database administrator (DBA) or system administrator.
However, the DBA or system administrator can request that the operator issue an MVS WRITELOG operator
command (for example, 'W A') to obtain MVS SYSLOG output. The SYSLOG sometimes contains media manager
messages that might be helpful to the DBA or system administrator in determining why space could not be allocated.
System programmer response: Based on the reason code (RC) in the message, as well as information that might be
available in access method services or VSAM messages preceding this one, try one of the following solutions:
v If you do not anticipate further extension of this table space or index, ignore the message.
v If the table space or index is backed by storage group-defined data sets and this data set is not at maximum
extents, use the ALTER STOGROUP statement to add volumes to the storage group (up to 133 of them).
v If the table space or index is backed by 'user-defined' data sets, and not at maximum extents for the data set, issue
an ALTER ADDVOLUMES access method services command to provide additional volumes (up to 133 of them).
Or, if the table space is nonpartitioned and the high allocated RBA is greater than or equal to 2GB (2,147,483,648)
for the indicated data set, define the data set required for the next sequential piece. (Actually, in this case, there
should be an indication in console messages or the reason code that the data set required for the next piece was
not found.)
v If the data set is at the maximum number of extents, recover or reorganize the table space or index after taking one
of the following actions:
C Enlarge the primary or secondary space allocation quantity of the table space or index.
C If the DB2 subsystem is running on z/OS V1.7 or later, and the data set is not shared with any z/OS systems at
an earlier level, convert the data set to SMS-managed with the Extent Constraint Removal option set to YES in
the SMS data class. If you do this, the maximum number of extents is 7257.
v If all of the following conditions are true, the maximum number of extents is 7257:
C The z/OS level is V1.7 or later
C The data set is SMS-managed
C The Extent Constraint Removal option is set to YES in the associated SMS data class
v If any of the conditions outlined in the previous bullet are not true, the maximum number of extents is:
C 251 to 255 for non-striped data sets
C 251 to 255 for each stripe for striped data sets
Problem determination: Examine the console messages, SYS1.LOGREC information, and SYSLOG to determine the
reason for the condition. Try to resolve it by the methods described in the Operator Response section of this message.
If you feel that this message indicates a problem in an IBM program, you should provide the following sources of
information about the problem:
v Console sheet showing the message and related messages that might precede or follow it.
v System log printout (obtained via MVS WRITELOG operator command) showing related VSAM/media manager
messages that might appear there (usually needed only if you have a message or reason code that indicates a
media manager services problem occurred).
v Integrated catalog facility (ICF) catalog listing showing characteristics of the data set in question and of the ICF
catalog itself.
v VTOC listing of packs associated with the request, showing space available for data sets, catalogs, VTOC index,
and the VTOC itself, as well as data set extent information.
v Any associated dumps.
v SYS1.LOGREC listing showing entries at or near the time of the problem (unless these appear in an associated
dump).
v Depending on the reason code, the results of certain SQL SELECT operations on DB2 catalog tables may be
needed.

DSNP002I csect - DEFINE FAILED FOR data-set-name RC=reason-code CONNECTION-ID=connection-id, CORRELATION-ID=correlation-id, LUW-ID=logical-unit-of-work-id =token
Explanation: Data set definition failed (in CSECT 'DSNPmmmm') for the reason identified by RC. The connection ID,
correlation ID, and logical-unit-of-work ID (LUW-ID) identify the user or application that encountered the problem.
The connection, correlation, and logical-unit-of-work IDs identify the user or application that encountered the
problem. Correlation IDs beginning with '0nn', where 'nn' is a number, identify system agents.
A LUW-ID of '*' indicates that the thread does not have a LUW-ID. If the LUW-ID is not an '*', the value is a
logical-unit-of-work-id that is assigned to the thread followed by an '=' sign and a token value, which can be used in
place of logical-unit-of-work-id in any DB2 command that accepts logical-unit-of-work-id as input.
Messages that have the same connection ID, correlation ID, and LUW-ID relate to the same user. This makes it

DSNP003I csect - RESET FAILED FOR data-set-name. RC=rrrrrrrr CONNECTION-ID=xxxxxxxx, CORRELATION-ID=yyyyyyyyyyyy, LUW-ID=logical-unit-of-work-id=token
Explanation: Reset, a data space manager (DSM) function invoked by DB2 utilities, failed in CSECT 'DSNPmmmm'
for the reason identified by RC. The connection ID, correlation ID, and logical-unit-of-work ID (LUW-ID) identify the
user or application that encountered the problem. Correlation IDs beginning with '0nn', where 'nn' is a number,
identify system agents.
A LUW-ID of '*' indicates that the thread does not have a LUW-ID. If the LUW-ID is not an '*', the value is a
logical-unit-of-work-id that is assigned to the thread followed by an '=' sign and a token value, which can be used in
place of logical-unit-of-work-id in any DB2 command that accepts logical-unit-of-work-id as input.
Messages that have the same connection ID, correlation ID, and LUW-ID relate to the same user. This makes it
possible to scan a number of DSNP-prefixed messages and tie together activities involving a given user.
System action: DSM terminates its actions associated with the current SQL request. Higher level functions might
terminate the current SQL request or the unit of recovery that issued the request.
Operator response: This message is directed to the database administrator or the system administrator. Bring it to
that person's attention if it appears on the MVS operator's console. The installation should consider directing DB2
messages to a console other than the operator's console.
System programmer response: Investigate the problem indicated by the reason code and preceding DB2, access
method services, or VSAM messages, if any, and correct it, if possible.
It might be necessary to delete and redefine the data set using access method services. Consider making a backup
copy before doing this. (Use DB2 utilities to make the copy; in general, VSAM utilities do not work on DB2 database
services data sets.)

DSNP004I csect - DELETE FAILED FOR data-set-name. RC=reason-code CONNECTION-ID=connection-id, CORRELATION-ID=correlation-id, LUW-ID=logical-unit-of-work-id=token
Explanation: Deletion failed in CSECT 'DSNPmmmm' for the reason identified by the RC=reason-code value. The
connection ID, correlation ID, and logical-unit-of-work ID (LUW-ID) identify the user or application that encountered
the problem. Correlation IDs beginning with '0nn', where 'nn' is a number, identify system agents.
The value of the LUWID is a logical-unit-of-work-id that is assigned to the thread followed by an '=' sign and a
token value, which can be used in place of logical-unit-of-work-id in any DB2 command that accepts
logical-unit-of-work-id as input.
Messages that have the same connection ID, correlation ID, and LUWID relate to the same user. This makes it
possible to scan a number of DSNP-prefixed messages and group activities involving a given user.
System action: DB2 terminates its actions associated with the current SQL request. DB2 might terminate the current
SQL request or the unit of recovery that issued the request.
Operator response: This message is directed to the database administrator or the system administrator. Bring it to
that person's attention if it appears on the MVS operator's console. The installation should consider directing DB2
messages to a console other than the operator's console.
System programmer response: Investigate the problem indicated by the reason code and preceding access method
services messages if any, and correct it, if possible. Check the data set and delete it by using access method services
directly if reasonable to do so. Consider making a backup copy before doing this. (Use DB2 utilities to make the
copy; in general, VSAM utilities do not work on DB2 data sets.)

DSNP005I csect - COULD NOT REMOVE EXCESS VOLUMES FROM CANDIDATE LIST OF data-set-name CONNECTION-ID=xxxxxxxx, CORRELATION-ID=yyyyyyyyyyyy, LUW-ID=logical-unit-of-work-id=token
Explanation: Volumes from a storage group were entered in the data set's candidate list and could not be removed
by CSECT 'DSNPmmmm' after some data space manager (DSM) operation. The connection ID, correlation ID, and
logical-unit-of-work ID (LUW-ID) identify the user or application that encountered the problem. Correlation IDs
beginning with '0nn', where 'nn' is a number, identify system agents.
A LUW-ID of '*' indicates that the thread does not have a LUW-ID. If the LUW-ID is not an '*', the value is a
logical-unit-of-work-id that is assigned to the thread followed by an '=' sign and a token value, which can be used in
place of logical-unit-of-work-id in any DB2 command that accepts logical-unit-of-work-id as input.
Messages that have the same connection ID, correlation ID, and LUW-ID relate to the same user. This makes it
possible to scan a number of DSNP-prefixed messages and group activities involving a given user.
This is not a major problem. However, the data set will not properly reflect subsequent deletions from the volume list
in its storage group (via ALTER STOGROUP command in SQL), because the data set's integrated catalog facility (ICF)
catalog entry still contains the volume serial numbers.
If needed, the storage group in question can be identified by issuing an SQL SELECT to get information about the
table space or index that is identified by the third and fourth qualifiers (database name, table space name) in the data
set name.
System action: Operation continues.
Operator response: This message is directed to the database administrator or the system administrator. Bring it to
that person's attention if it appears on the MVS operator's console. The installation should consider directing DB2
messages to a console other than the operator's console.
System programmer response: Look for associated DSM and access method services messages preceding this one to
get additional information. Attempt an ALTER REMOVEVOLUMES access method services command, if appropriate,
after issuing a LISTCAT to see which volumes are recorded as 'candidate' in the integrated catalog facility (ICF)
catalog.
Problem determination: See Problem Determination for message DSNP001I for this information. (However, there
should not be a need for VTOC or SYSLOG information for this case.)
DSNP006I csect - REQUIRED STOGROUP DEFINED DATA SET NOT AVAILABLE- data-set-name RC=rrrrrrrr CONNECTION-ID=xxxxxxxx, CORRELATION-ID=yyyyyyyyyyyy, LUW-ID=logical-unit-of-work-id=token
Explanation: An attempt to alter the shareoptions of this data set failed. The data set could not be accessed for the
reason indicated by RC. The connection ID, correlation ID, and logical-unit-of-work ID (LUWID) identify the user or
application that encountered the problem. Correlation IDs beginning with '0nn', where 'nn' is a number, identify
system agents.
The value of the LUWIDis a logical-unit-of-work-id that is assigned to the thread followed by an '=' sign and a token
value, which can be used in place of the logical-unit-of-work-id in any DB2 command that accepts the
logical-unit-of-work-id as input.
Messages having the same connection ID, correlation ID, and LUWID relate to the same user. This makes it possible
to scan a number of DSNP-prefixed messages and group activities involving a given user.
System action: DB2 terminates its actions associated with the current SQL request. DB2 might terminate the current
SQL request or the unit of recovery that issued the request.
Operator response: This message is directed to the database administrator or the system administrator. Bring it to
that person's attention if it appears on the MVS operator's console. The installation should consider directing DB2
messages to a console other than the operator's console.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.

DSNP007I csect-name - EXTEND FAILED FOR data-set-name. RC=reason-code CONNECTION-ID=connection-id, CORRELATION-ID=correlation-id, LUW-ID=logical-unit-of-work-id = token
Explanation: Extension failed in control section DSNPmmmm of the data space manager (DSM). The data-set-name
value identifies the data set that is being extended. The reason-code value is the reason code, which indicates why the
extend process failed. The connection-id, correlation-id, and logical-unit-of-work-id values identify the user or application
that encountered the problem. Correlation identifiers begin with '0nn', where nn is a number that identifies system
agents.
When the logical-unit-of-work-id value is '*' (asterisk) the thread does not have a LUWID. If the logical-unit-of-work-id
value is not '*', the logical-unit-of-work-id value is a logical unit of work identifier (LUWID) that is assigned to the
thread, followed by an '=' (equal sign) and a token value, which can be used in place of the LUWID in any DB2
command that accepts the LUWID value as input.
Messages that have the same connection-id, correlation-id, and logical-unit-of-work-id values relate to the same user. This
situation makes it possible to scan a number of DSNP-prefixed messages and group activities involving a given user.
System action: The DSM terminates its actions associated with this extend request. Higher level functions might
terminate if they cannot continue without a successful extend. In this case, additional console messages and/or SQL
codes are produced. In other cases, higher level functions might be able to resolve the space need without the extend,
so they continue normally.
Operator response: See Operator Response for message DSNP001I for this information.
System programmer response: The following sources of information are available to help determine the cause of the
failure:
v See the Programmer Response for message DSNP001I.
v Analyze the reason-code value in conjunction with the console messages.
v The reason code might apply to the data set identified in the message or to another data set that is needed for the
extend process. If the reason code indicates a data set access failure, the console messages indicate the data set
name. For example, if the RC indicates 'resource unavailable', console messages identify the resource that is
unavailable. Most likely, the message is DSNT500I.
v Retrieve diagnostic information from the output of the DISPLAY DB...RESTRICT or DISPLAY UTIL(*)... commands.
v For information about finding the system diagnostic work area (SDWA), see DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.

Explanation: One of the following actions applied against user-defined data sets failed in CSECT 'DSNPmmmm' of
the data space manager (DSM):
v Create table space or index
v Extend table space or index
v Process the SQL ALTER DATABASE statement
v Process the REORG TABLESPACE utility with SHRLEVEL REFERENCE or CHANGE
Correlation IDs beginning with '0nn', where 'nn' is a number, identify system agents.
One or more of the data sets could not be accessed for the reason indicated by RC. The connection ID, correlation ID,
and logical-unit-of-work ID (LUWID) identify the user or application that encountered the problem.
The value of the LUWID is alogical-unit-of-work-id that is assigned to the thread followed by an '=' sign and a token
value, which can be used in place of logical-unit-of-work-id in any DB2 command that accepts logical-unit-of-work-id
as input.
Messages having the same connection ID, correlation ID, and LUWID relate to the same user. This makes it possible
to scan a number of DSNP-prefixed messages and group activities involving a given user.
If the name of the data set in the message is different from the name of the original data set (for example, '....A002'
instead of '...A001'), a new data set might need to be created. A different name indicates that the original data set
exceeded its limit.
System action: DB2 terminates its actions associated with the current SQL request or utility. DB2 might terminate
the current SQL request or utility or the unit of recovery that issued the request.
Operator response: This message is directed to the database administrator or the system administrator. Bring it to
that person's attention if it appears on the MVS operator's console. The installation should consider directing DB2
messages to a console other than the operator's console.
System programmer response: The return code description might indicate that one of the following actions needs to
be performed or it indicates the necessary steps:
v If the data set does not exist, create it before attempting the create table space/index or extend data set again.
v If the data set shareoptions are incorrect, modify the shareoptions with access method services (AMS).
v The appropriate AMS command is ALTER SHAREOPTIONS.

Explanation: Messages DSNP009I and DSNP010I enclose a block of messages that are received by the data space
manager (DSM) subcomponent of DB2 in response to an access method services (AMS) operation.
operation
The access method services operation that was being performed.
data-set-name
The data set on which the operation was being performed.
The prefix of the messages in the block is usually IDC (access method services messages). However, the prefix can
also be IKJ (dynamic allocation) or other system subcomponent IDs. Refer to the appropriate MVS publication for
descriptions of the enclosed messages.
The operation can be DEFINE CLUSTER, ALTER ADDVOLUMES, ALTER REMOVEVOLUMES, ALTER NEWNAME,
or DELETE CLUSTER. One or more other DSM messages follow this message to explain what happened as a result
of the failure of this access method services request. The connection ID, correlation ID, and logical-unit-of-work ID
(LUW-ID) identify the user or application that encountered the problem.
A LUW-ID of '*' indicates that the thread does not have a LUW-ID. If the LUW-ID is not an '*', the value is a
logical-unit-of-work-id that is assigned to the thread followed by an '=' sign and a token value, which can be used in
place of logical-unit-of-work-id in any DB2 command that accepts logical-unit-of-work-id as input.
Messages that have the same connection ID, correlation ID, and LUW-ID relate to the same user. This makes it
possible to scan a number of DSNP-prefixed messages and group activities involving a given user. Correlation IDs
beginning with '0nn', where 'nn' is a number, identify system agents.
System action: Operation continues.
Operator response: This message is directed to the database administrator or the system administrator. Bring it to
that person's attention if it appears on the MVS operator's console. The installation should consider directing DB2
messages to a console other than the operator's console.
System programmer response: Use this information to help resolve problems indicated by other DSM messages that

DSNP011I csect-name - MEDIA MANAGER SERVICES ERROR FOR data-set-name. MMRC=cccccccc DSMRC=ffffffff CONNECTION-ID=connection-id, CORRELATION-ID=correlation-id, LUW-ID=logical-unit-of-work-id =token
Explanation: The MMRC is the return code that DB2 received from media manager services. Refer to the
appropriate MVS publication for a description of these codes. DSMRC is a DSM reason code that indicates which of
the media manager services functions, update or extend, failed. The message is from CSECT 'DSNPmmmm' of the
data space manager (DSM). The connection ID, correlation ID, and logical-unit-of-work ID (LUW-ID) identify the
user or application that encountered the problem. Correlation IDs beginning with '0nn', where nn is a number,
identify system agents.
A LUW-ID of '*' indicates that the thread does not have a LUW-ID. If the LUW-ID is not an '*', the value is a
logical-unit-of-work-id that is assigned to the thread followed by an '=' sign and a token value, which can be used in
place of logical-unit-of-work-id in any DB2 command that accepts logical-unit-of-work-id as input.
Messages that have the same connection ID, correlation ID, and LUW-ID relate to the same user. This makes it
possible to scan a number of DSNP-prefixed messages and group activities involving a given user.
System action: The DSM terminates its actions associated with the current SQL request. Higher level functions
might terminate the current SQL request or the unit of recovery that issued the request.
Operator response: DSM messages are directed to either the database administrator (DBA) or the system
administrator. However, they can request that the operator issue an MVS WRITELOG operator command (for
example, 'W A') to obtain MVS SYSLOG output. The SYSLOG sometimes contains media manager messages that
might be helpful to the DBA or system administrator in determining why space could not be allocated.
System programmer response: This message might be preceded by one or more IEC or ICY messages on the
console or in SYSLOG. These messages help to determine what happened and what action to take.

DSNP012I csect - ERROR IN ICF CATALOG LOCATE FUNCTION FOR data-set-name CTLGRC=cc CTLGRSN=zzzzrrss CONNECTION-ID=xxxxxxxx, CORRELATION-ID=yyyyyyyyyyyy, LUW-ID=luw-id
Explanation:
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
data-set-name
The name of the data set
cc The return code that DB2 received from an SVC 26 call (ICF catalog locate function).
zzzzrrss The reason code that DB2 received from an SVC 26 call (ICF catalog locate function). The reason code is in
the same format as that returned to DB2 by the SVC 26 call.
If cc is 4 or 8, the reason code is associated with access method services message IDC3009I. To determine the
name of the CSECT that set the reason code, convert zzzz from hexadecimal to EBCDIC, and append the
resulting 2 characters to 'IGG0CL'. For example, suppose that zzzz is C6C6. The EBCDIC equivalent of
X'C6C6' is 'FF', so the CSECT that set the reason code is IGG0CLFF.
rr is the hexadecimal equivalent of the reason code value that is documented in access method services
message IDC3009I. ss is the hexadecimal equivalent of the return code value that is documented in access
method services message IDC3009I. (The return code follows the reason code.) Convert rr and ss to decimal.
Then, see the description of IDC3009I for explanations of the reason code and return code. For example,
suppose that rrss is 0532. The decimal equivalent of X'32' is 50, and the decimal equivalent of X'05' is 5.
Therefore, in IDC3009I, you need to look up a return code of 50 and a reason code of 5.
If CTLGRC=AAAAAA08 and CTLGRSN=AAAAAA08, zzzzrrss is not associated with access method services
message IDC3009I. AAAAAA08 indicates that the specified data set is not in the ICF catalog.
xxxxxxxx
The connection ID for the user or application that encountered the problem.
yyyyyyyyyyyy
The correlation ID for the user or application that encountered the problem.
Correlation IDs that begin with '0nn', where nn is a number, identify system agents.
luw-id The logical unit of work (LUW) ID for the user or application that encountered the problem.
An LUW ID with an asterisk (*) indicates that the thread does not have an LUW ID. If the LUW ID is not an
asterisk (*), the value is an LUW ID that is assigned to the thread followed by an equals sign (=) and a
token value. (The token value can be used in place of the LUW ID in any DB2 command that accepts an
LUW ID as input.)
Messages that have the same connection ID, correlation ID, and LUW ID relate to the same user. This situation makes
it possible to scan a number of DSNP messages and group activities that involve a particular user.
System action: DB2 terminates its actions that are associated with the current SQL request. Higher-level functions
might terminate the current SQL request or the unit of recovery that issued the request.
System programmer response: Correct the problem that is indicated by the catalog return and reason codes.

DSNP013I INSUFFICIENT PRIMARY ALLOCATION SPACE TO FORMAT CONTROL PAGES IN DATA SET data-set-name CONNECTION-ID=xxxxxxxx, CORRELATION-ID=yyyyyyyyyyyy, LUW-ID=logical-unit-ofwork- id =token
Explanation: Data space manager (DSM) discovered that the primary space quantity given in the data set definition
was not large enough. Formatting of required control information in the first several pages was not possible. The
connection ID, correlation ID, and logical-unit-of-work ID (LUW-ID) identify the user or application that encountered
the problem.
A LUW-ID of '*' indicates that the thread does not have a LUW-ID. If the LUW-ID is not an '*', the value is a
logical-unit-of-work-id that is assigned to the thread followed by an '=' sign and a token value, which can be used in
place of logical-unit-of-work-id in any DB2 command that accepts logical-unit-of-work-id as input.
Messages that have the same connection ID, correlation ID, and LUW-ID relate to the same user. This makes it
possible to scan a number of DSNP-prefixed messages and group activities involving a given user. Correlation IDs
beginning with '0nn', where 'nn' is a number, identify system agents.
System action: DSM terminates its actions associated with the current SQL request. Higher level functions might
terminate the current SQL request or the unit of recovery that issued the request.
Operator response: This message is directed to the database administrator or the system administrator. Bring it to
that person's attention if it appears on the MVS operator's console. The installation should consider directing DB2
messages to a console other than the operator's console.
System programmer response: This should occur only for table spaces or indexes that are not storage group
defined. (The DB2 interpreter forces the initial allocation to be large enough if a storage group is used.) Check both
the page size specification (4KB or 32KB) and the number of control pages required (2 for table space, 3 for index
space). Specify the primary allocation value again so that at least (pages multiplied by page size) bytes are allocated.
Problem determination: See Problem Determination for message DSNP001I for this information.
DSNP014I IRLM MANUAL LOCK REQUEST FAILED FOR data-set-name. RC=reason-code,SC=subcode, CONNECTION-ID=connection-id, CORRELATION-ID=correlation-id, LUW-ID=logical-unit-of-workid= token
Explanation: DB2 requested a manual lock on a data set, but the lock could not be obtained for reasons specified in
RC and SC. RC and SC are the return code and reason code from IRLM. The connection ID, correlation ID, and
logical-unit-of-work ID (LUW-ID) identify the user or application that encountered the problem.
A LUW-ID of '*' indicates that the thread does not have a LUW-ID. If the LUW-ID is not an '*', the value is a
logical-unit-of-work-id that is assigned to the thread followed by an '=' sign and a token value, which can be used in
place of logical-unit-of-work-id in any DB2 command that accepts logical-unit-of-work-id as input.
Messages that have the same connection ID, correlation ID, and LUW-ID relate to the same user. This makes it
possible to scan a number of DSNP-prefixed messages and group activities involving a given user. DSNP001I or DSNP007I follow this message. Correlation IDs beginning with '0nn', where 'nn' is a number, identify system agents.
If message DSNT376I was received before message DSNP014I, the lock request failed because of a timeout condition.
Otherwise, refer to the IRLM return and reason codes for an explanation of the failure.
System action: The current SQL or the unit of recovery that issued the request might be terminated.
Operator response: This message is directed to the database administrator or the system administrator. Bring it to
that person's attention if it appears on the MVS operator's console. The installation should consider directing DB2
messages to a console other than the operator's console.
System programmer response: Investigate the problem indicated by the IRLM return and reason code.
Problem determination: Provide the console sheet and a dump. A GTF trace might also be required. If you suspect
an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem,
see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference. Refer to the explanation section of this

DSNP028I csect-name HSM RECALL FAILED FOR DSNAME = dsn HSMRC=rrrrrrrr,HSMRSN=ssssssss CONNECTION ID=xxxxxxxx, CORRELATION ID=yyyyyyyyyyyy, LUW-ID=logical-unit-of-work-id =token
Explanation: This message indicates that a required data set was migrated by HSM and an attempt to recall the
data set failed, preventing DB2 from accessing the data set. The HSMRC and HSMRSN fields can be used to
determine the HSM failure. See Problem Determination below. The connection ID, correlation ID, and
'logical-unit-of-work ID' (LUW-ID) identify the user or application that encountered the problem.
A LUW-ID of '*' indicates that the thread does not have a LUW-ID. If the LUW-ID is not an '*', the value is a
'logical-unit-of-work-id' that is assigned to the thread followed by an '=' sign and a token value, which can be used in
place of 'logical-unit-of-work-id' in any DB2 command that accepts 'logical-unit-of-work-id' as input.
Messages that have the same connection ID, correlation ID, and LUW-ID relate to the same user. This makes it
possible to scan a number of DSNP-prefixed messages and group activities involving a given user. Correlation IDs
beginning with '0nn', where 'nn' is a number, identify system agents.
System action: DSM terminates its action with the associated data set. Higher level functions that issued the recall
request might terminate.

100 There was an invalid function used.
For all other reason codes (HSMRSN), refer to the z/OS DFSMShsm Managing Your Own Data for an explanation of
HSM user messages. The HSM user messages can be determined by appending the value in the HSMRC field of this
message to ARC1100I (that is, HSMRC=12, HSM message is ARC1112I). The HSMRSN reason code is referenced in
the ARC1100I messages.
DSNP030I csect-name THE CURRENT EXTENT REACHES THE LAST VOLUME FOR data-set-name.  CONNECTION-ID=xxxxxxxx, CORRELATION-ID=yyyyyyyyyyyy, LUW-ID=logical-unit-of-work-id=token
Explanation: This message indicates that the last volume to which the data set data-set-name can extend has been
reached. You cannot add more volumes if the current volume runs out of space.
The connection, correlation, and logical-unit-of-work IDs identify the user or application that encountered the
problem. Correlation IDs beginning with '0nn', where 'nn' is a number, identify system agents.
A LUW-ID of '*' indicates that the thread does not have a LUW-ID. If the LUW-ID is not an '*', the value is a
logical-unit-of-work-id that is assigned to the thread followed by an '=' sign and a token value, which can be used in
place of logical-unit-of-work-id in any DB2 command that accepts logical-unit-of-work-id as input.
Messages that have the same connection ID, correlation ID, and LUW-ID relate to the same user. This makes it
possible to scan a number of DSNP-prefixed messages and group activities involving a given user.
System action: If sufficient space in current volume is available for the current request, DB2 continues. Otherwise,
message DSNP007I is issued, and the current SQL request fails.
Operator response: For more information, issue an MVS WRITELOG operator command (for example, 'W A') to
obtain MVS SYSLOG output. The SYSLOG sometimes contains VSAM or media manager messages that might be
helpful in determining why space could not be allocated.
System programmer response: Depending on what information is available in the access method services or VSAM
messages preceding this one, try one of the following:
v If you do not anticipate further extension of this table space or index, ignore the message.
v If the table space or index is backed by SMS-managed data sets, use LISTCAT to choose another SMS storage
group that has more space available and recover or reorganize the table space or index into the new SMS storage
group.
v If the table space or index is DB2-managed but is not SMS-managed, rearrange the DB2 storage group volume list
by shifting volumes with free space or by adding new volumes. Use the SQL statements ALTER STOGROUP ADD
VOLUMES and ALTER STOGROUP REMOVE VOLUMES and then recover or reorganize the table space or index.
v If the table space or index is user-managed and not SMS-managed, delete and redefine the data set with more
space and then recover or reorganize the table space or index.
Problem determination: Obtain an access method services LISTCAT for the named data set's VOLUME list for
current extent space distribution of volumes.
See the Problem Determination section of message DSNP001I for more information.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNP031I csect-name - CURRENT SPACE HAS nn EXTENTS FOR data-set-name. THE MAXIMUM EXTENTS IS mm. CONNECTION-ID=connection-identifier, CORRELATION-ID=-correlation-identifier, LUW-ID=logical-unit-of-work-id=token
Explanation: This message indicates that data set data-set-name has almost reached the maximum number of extents.
The maximum number is indicated by mm. You cannot add more volumes if the current volume runs out of space.
The connection, correlation, and logical-unit-of-work IDs identify the user or application that encountered the
problem. Correlation IDs beginning with 0nn (where nn is a number) identifies system agents.
A LUW-ID of an asterisk (*) indicates that the thread does not have a LUW-ID. If the LUW-ID is not an asterisk (*),
the value is a logical-unit-of-work-id that is assigned to the thread followed by an equals sign (=) and a token value,
which can be used in place of logical-unit-of-work-id in any DB2 command that accepts logical-unit-of-work-id as
input.
Messages that have the same connection ID, correlation ID, and LUW-ID relate to the same user. Including all three
pieces of information makes it possible to scan a number of DSNP-prefixed messages and group activities involving a
given user.
System action: DB2 continues. If the table space or index space is not able to extend when needed, Message DSNP001I is issued and the current SQL request fails.
Operator response: For more information, issue an MVS WRITELOG operator command (for example, 'W A') to
obtain MVS SYSLOG output. The SYSLOG sometimes contains VSAM or media manager messages that might be
helpful in determining why space could not be allocated.
System programmer response: Based on the information that might be available in the access method services or
VSAM messages preceding this one, try one of the following actions:
v If you do not anticipate further extension of this table space or index, ignore the message.
v If the table space or index is DB2-managed and has not yet reached the maximum number of extents, obtain an
access method services LISTCAT for the named data set's to see how the extensions are distributed. Your options
then include:
C If there are multiple small extents, you can use the SQL statement ALTER TABLESPACE SECQTY to alter to a
larger secondary space allocation quantity.
C Otherwise, use the ALTER STOGROUP statement to add volumes to the storage group (up to 133 of them).
v If the table space or index is user-managed and has not yet reached the maximum number of extents, issue the
access method services command ALTER ADDVOLUMES to provide additional volumes (up to 59 of them).
v If the data set is at the maximum number of extents, recover or reorganize the table space or index after taking one
of the following actions:
C Enlarge the primary or secondary space allocation quantity of the table space or index.
C If the DB2 subsystem is running on z/OS V1.7 or later, and the data set is not shared with any z/OS systems at
an earlier level, convert the data set to SMS-managed with the Extent Constraint Removal option set to YES in
the SMS data class. If you do this, the maximum number of extents is 7257.
Problem determination: Obtain an access method services LISTCAT for the named data set's VOLUME list for the
extent space distribution.

DSNR001I RESTART INITIATED
Explanation: This message delimits the beginning of the restart process within startup. The phases of restart are
about to begin. These phases are necessary to restore the operational environment to that which existed at the time of
the previous termination and to perform any recovery actions that may be necessary to return DB2-managed
resources to a consistent state.
DSNR002I RESTART COMPLETED
Explanation: This message delimits the completion of the restart process within startup.
DSNR003I RESTART...PRIOR CHECKPOINT RBA=xxxxxxxxxxxx
Explanation: The message indicates the first phase of the restart process is in progress and identifies (as
'xxxxxxxxxxxx') the log positioning RBA of the checkpoint from which the restart process will obtain its initial
recovery information.
DSNR004I RESTART...UR STATUS COUNTS IN COMMIT=nnnn, INDOUBT=nnnn, INFLIGHT=nnnn, IN ABORT=nnnn, POSTPONED ABORT=nnnn
Explanation: This message indicates the completion of the first phase of the restart process. The counts indicate the
number of units of work whose execution state during a previous DB2 termination was such that (to ensure DB2
resource consistency) some recovery action must be performed during this restart process or (by the user) upon
completion of the restart process. The counts of IN COMMIT, INDOUBT, INFLIGHT and IN ABORT may provide an
indication of the time required to perform the remaining two phases of restart (forward and backward recovery). The
counts of POSTPONED ABORT URs may provide an indication of the time required to perform -RECOVER
POSTPONED processing.
The IN COMMIT count specifies the number that had started but not completed phase 2 of the commit process.
These must undergo forward recovery to complete the commit process.
The INDOUBT count specifies the number that were interrupted between phase 1 and phase 2 of the commit process.
These must undergo forward recovery to ensure resources modified by them are unavailable until their indoubt
status is resolved.
The INFLIGHT count specifies the number that neither completed phase 1 of the commit process nor began the
process of backing out. These must undergo backward recovery to restore resources modified by them to their
previous consistent state.
The IN ABORT count specifies the number that were in the process of backing out. These must undergo backward
recovery to restore resources modified by them to their previous consistent state.
The POSTPONED ABORT count specifies the number whose backout was postponed in an earlier restart process and
not attended to prior to this restart process. These must undergo backward recovery after completion of restart, via
the -RECOVER POSTPONED command, to restore resources modified by them to their previous consistent state.
DSNR005I RESTART...COUNTS AFTER FORWARD RECOVERY IN COMMIT=nnnn, INDOUBT=nnnn
Explanation: The message indicates the completion of the forward recovery restart phase. The counts indicate the
number of units of work whose recovery actions could not be completed during the phase. Typically, those in an IN
COMMIT state remain because the recovery actions of some subcomponents have not been completed. Those units of
work in an INDOUBT state will remain until connection is made with the subsystem that acts as their commit
coordinator.
Operator response: No action is required unless the conditions persist beyond some installation-defined period of
time. Recovery action will be initiated when the resource is brought online. Indoubt resolution will be initiated as
part of the process of reconnecting the subsystems.
DSNR006I RESTART...COUNTS AFTER BACKWARD RECOVERY INFLIGHT=nnnn, IN ABORT=nnnn, POSTPONED ABORT=nnnn
Explanation: The message indicates the completion of the backward recovery restart phase. The counts indicate the
number of units of work whose recovery actions could not be completed during the phase.
When INFLIGHT or IN ABORT URs do not complete backout during restart, they are converted to POSTPONED
ABORT status, so the INFLIGHT and IN ABORT counts should be zero. The POSTPONED ABORT count indicates
the number of URs for which backout work still exists (from this or a previous restart).
Backout work for the POSTPONED ABORT URs should be completed by the user (by using the RECOVER
POSTPONED command) after DB2 restart has completed.
Operator response: No action is required unless the condition persists beyond some installation-defined period of
time. Recovery action will be initiated when the resource collection is brought online.
DSNR007I RESTART...STATUS TABLE
Explanation: This message precedes a table showing the status of units of recovery (URs) after each restart phase.
The message and the table will accompany the DSNR004I, DSNR005I, or DSNR006I message after each nested phase.
At the end of the current status rebuild phase, it shows the status of any URs that require processing. At the end of
the forward recovery and backoutphases, it shows the status of only those URs which needed processing but were
not processed. The table helps to identify the URs that were active when DB2 came down, and to determine the log
scope required to bring DB2 up.
The following list describes each column of the table:
T Connection type. The values could be:
B Batch: a batch program or QMF user.
I Internal: a system service being performed on some user's behalf.
S Subsystem: work that originated from an attached subsystem, either CICS or IMS/VS.
CONID
Connection identifier for related URs. Batch connections are not related to any other connection. Subsystem
connections with the same identifier indicate URs that originated from the same subsystem.
CORRID
Correlation identifier; unique within a subsystem connection, it relates a UR to a particular CICS or IMS/VS
transaction.
AUTHORIZATION ID
Authorization identifier of the user for whom this UR was created.
PLAN Name of the plan allocated to the UR.
S Restart status of the UR. When DB2 came down, the UR was in one of these situations:
A INABORT: The UR was in the 'must-complete' phase of abort, and is yet to be completed.
C INCOMMIT: The UR was in the 'must-complete' phase of commit, and is yet to be completed.
D INDOUBT: The UR had completed the first phase of commit, but DB2 had not received the second
phase instruction. The UR must be remembered so it can be resolved when the owning subsystem
reattaches.
F INFLIGHT: The UR had not completed the first phase of commit, and will be backed out.
P POSTPONED ABORT: The UR has not yet completed backout. Backout must be completed outside
of DB2 restart by means of the -RECOVER POSTPONED command.
URID UR identifier, the log RBA of the beginning of this unit of work. It is the earliest RBA required to process the
UR during Restart.
DAY The day the UR was created, in the format 'ddd'. It is approximately the time of the first SQL statement of
the application or the first SQL statement following a commit point.
TIME The time the UR was created, in the format 'hh mm ss '. It is approximately the time of the first SQL
statement of the application or the first SQL statement following a commit point.
DSNR009I STORAGE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE UR DISPLAY TABLE, THE SIZE REQUESTED = xxxx, STORAGE MANAGER REASON CODE = yyyyyyyy
Explanation: There was not enough storage available during the creation of the recoverable UR (RURE) display
table (DSNDRUDT).
System action: The system continues to restart but the RESTART... STATUS TABLE is not displayed.
Operator response: Save the console output and inform the system programmer.
System programmer response: Increase the region size of the ssnmMSTR address space before restarting DB2 again.
Problem determination: The size requested is approximately 110 bytes for each unit of recovery (UR). See the
message DSNR004I to determine the total number of URs to process. Then get the 00E2xxxx reason code from the
DSNR009I header. Use these two numbers to determine the reason for the shortage.  DSNR010I AN ERROR OCCURRED IN THE RURE STATUS TABLE SORT/TRANSLATE MODULE (DSNRUSOR), THE ERROR LOCATION CODE = xxxx
Explanation: There was an error in processing the RURE display table. One of these ERROR LOCATION CODES
tells what function the module was attempting to perform:
X'0001' Trace entry to the module
X'0002' Sort the recoverable UR display table
X'0003' Translate the recoverable UR table
X'0004' Convert the store clock value for display
X'0005' Trace exit from the module
System action: The system continues to restart but the RESTART... STATUS TABLE is not displayed.
Operator response: Save the console output and inform the system programmer.
System programmer response: Use the error code in the message to complete the problem description.
Problem determination: The ERROR CODE tells the problem area and should be used in the problem description.
A record was added to the SYS1.LOGREC that contains the PSW and module at the time of the error. This error
indicates an application program check of some type.
DSNR011I AN ERROR OCCURRED IN THE RURE STATUS TABLE DISPLAY MODULE (DSNRUDIS), THE ERROR LOCATION CODE = xxxx
Explanation: There was an error in processing the RURE display table. One of these ERROR LOCATION CODES
tells what function the module was attempting to perform:
X'0001' Trace entry to the module
X'0002' Build header for the display table
X'0003' Build entries for the display table
X'0004' Call DSNRWTO to display the table
X'0005' Trace exit from the module
X'0006' Get message text
System action: The system continues to restart but the RESTART... STATUS TABLE is not displayed.
Operator response: Save the console output and inform the system programmer.
System programmer response: Use the error code in the message to complete the problem description.
Problem determination: The ERROR CODE describes the problem area and should be used in the problem
description. A record was added to the SYS1.LOGREC containing the value DSNRUDIS, and the PSW and CSECT at
the time of the error. This error indicates an application program check of some type.
Error codes other than X'0006' indicate an application program check of some type. Code X'0006' indicates an error
attempting to locate the table text. The trace entry for DSNRUDIS contains the return and reason codes from the Get
Text request. That information should be used to complete the problem description.
DSNR014I EXCLUDED RURE TABLE
Explanation: This message contains a list of RUREs which are being bypassed because of the conditional restart.
Either they were to be processed in a phase that was bypassed or they were outside the log range.
The following list describes each column of the table:
T Connection type. The values could be:
B Batch: a batch program or QMF user.
I Internal: a system service being performed on some user's behalf.
S Subsystem: work that originated from an attached subsystem, either CICS or IMS/VS.
CONID
Connection identifier for related URs. Batch connections are not related to any other connection. Subsystem
connections with the same identifier indicate URs that originated from the same subsystem.
CORRID
Correlation identifier; unique within a subsystem connection, it relates a UR to a particular CICS or IMS/VS
transaction.
AUTHORIZATION ID
Authorization identifier of the user for whom this UR was created.
PLAN Name of the plan allocated to the UR.
S Restart status of the UR. When DB2 came down, the UR was in one of these situations:
A INABORT: The UR was in the 'must-complete' phase of abort, and is yet to be completed.
C INCOMMIT: The UR was in the 'must-complete' phase of commit, and is yet to be completed.
D INDOUBT: The UR had completed the first phase of commit, but DB2 had not received the second
phase instruction. The UR must be remembered so it can be resolved when the owning subsystem
reattaches.
F INFLIGHT: The UR had not completed the first phase of commit, and will be backed out.
P POSTPONED ABORT: The UR has not yet completed backout. Backout must be completed outside
of DB2 restart by means of the -RECOVER POSTPONED command.
URID UR identifier, the log RBA of the beginning of this unit of work. It is the earliest RBA required to process the
UR during Restart.
DAY The day the UR was created, in the format 'ddd'. It is approximately the time of the first SQL statement of
the application or the first SQL statement following a commit point.
TIME The time the UR was created, in the format 'hh mm ss '. It is approximately the time of the first SQL
statement of the application or the first SQL statement following a commit point.
System action: Restart continues.
DSNR015I THE CHKPTRBA xxxxxxxxxxxx SPECIFIED IN THE CRCR IS INVALID
Explanation: The checkpoint RBA specified in the conditional restart control record (CRCR) is either not available or
is not a begin checkpoint record.
System action: Restart is abended with reason code '00D99001'.
Operator response: Inform the system programmer.
System programmer response: By specifying the STARTRBA and/or ENDRBA on the CRESTART control statement,
change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility selects an appropriate RBA.
Problem determination: Print the complete checkpoint records queue by using the print log map (DSNJU004) utility.
Select a checkpoint RBA from this queue or let the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility make the selection.
DSNR016I STARTRBA xxxxxxxxxxxx VALIDATION FAILED
Explanation: A scan from the STARTRBA failed to find a complete log record. Either the entire log was scanned and
no complete record was found, or the log manager found an invalid log record. The log manager sends the error
messages to the console indicating a bad log record.
System action: Restart abends.
Operator response: Record the log manager message numbers and inform the system programmer.
System programmer response: Use DSN1LOGP to determine a STARTRBA to use for restart. The recovery manager
uses the STARTRBA as a starting point for its search of the beginning of a valid log record.
DSNR017I RESTART IS BEING TERMINATED BECAUSE OF CSRONLY SPECIFICATION IN CRCR
Explanation: The restart procedure only completed the first phase of startup. The status displayed during this
partial restart can be used to build the conditional restart control record (CRCR).
System action: Restart is abended.
System programmer response: To prevent the restart control record from being reused during the next restart
attempt, the current restart control record must be canceled. Use the change log inventory (DSNJU003) CRESTART
CANCEL option, or create a new restart control record. The newly created restart control record will automatically
cancel the previous record.
DSNR018I csect-name RESTART...BACKWARD RECOVERY PROCESSED FROM RBA ffffffffffff TO RBA tttttttttttt
Explanation: This message indicates the range of log processed during the backward phase of RESTART when
postponed backout processing has been requested. Processing began with the LR of RBA ffffffffffff and proceeded
backwards to the LR of RBA tttttttttttt.
System action: This message is followed by messages DSNR006I and DSNR007I. The former tells how many URs
had some backout work postponed. The latter, identifies the postponed abort URs. The amount of log that need to be
processed to complete backout processing for the postponed abort URs can be gauged by comparing the RBA
reached during RESTART's backward processing (RBA tttttttttttt), and the URIDs of the postponed abort URs.
DSNR020I csect-name START MEMBER member, OR REPLY 'NO' OR 'QUIESCED'
Explanation: During a group restart, the group member issuing this message attempted to access the BSDS for
member member, and either was not able to access the BSDS, or discovered that the BSDS was modified by the
change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility since that member was last started. In either case, this DB2 is not able to
perform peer restart for member member.
For group restart to continue, the identified member must be started.
If it is not possible to start the other member and you want to terminate this group restart, you can reply 'NO' to this
message. Replying 'NO' to this message causes this DB2 to terminate with a reason code of 00D900E1. You then have
to reply 'NO' to this message for all remaining members participating in this group restart.
If you are sure that the identified member was quiesced the last time it was started, that is, it was stopped with a
-STOP DB2 MODE(QUIESCE) command and it stopped with no indoubt units of recovery and no distributed
resynchronization responsibility, then you can reply 'QUIESCED' to this message. Replying 'QUIESCED' to this
message causes message DSNR030I to be issued as a reminder that group restart will continue without using the log
from the identified member.
System action: This group member waits for the identified member to be started or for a valid reply to this
message.
v If the identified member is started, group restart continues.
v If the reply is 'NO', this DB2 terminates with a reason code of 00D900E1.
v If the reply is 'QUIESCED', group restart continues without using the log from the identified member.
DSNR021I csect-name DB2 SUBSYSTEM MUST PERFORM GROUP RESTART FOR PEER MEMBERS
Explanation: This DB2 subsystem must perform the group restart phase to recover either the shared
communications area (SCA) or the retained locks for nonstarting members in the data sharing group.
This message marks the beginning of group restart processing for peer members. Messages DSNR023I and DSNR024I
or messages DSNR025I and DSNR026I are issued for each peer that is processed by this DB2 subsystem. Message DSNR022I marks the end of group restart processing for peer members.
This message is issued before this DB2 member enters the group restart process. The group restart process is
synchronized among all group members that are starting and therefore participating in this group restart. After this
DB2 member synchronizes with other members, it is possible that no peer processing will be necessary; in that case
message DSNR022I immediately follows this message.
If it is necessary to recover both the SCA and retained locks, this message is issued twice; once for SCA recovery and
again for the recovery of the retained locks.
System action: The subsystem begins group restart processing.
DSNR022I csect-name DB2 SUBSYSTEM HAS COMPLETED GROUP RESTART FOR PEER MEMBERS
Explanation: This DB2 subsystem, which previously issued message DSNR021I, completed the group restart phase
to recover the shared communications area (SCA) or retained locks for nonstarting DB2 members in the data sharing
group.
System action: The subsystem continues with the next restart phase of its own subsystem.
DSNR023I csect-name GROUP RESTART INITIATED TO RECOVER THE SCA FOR GROUP MEMBER membname
Explanation: The DB2 subsystem that issued this message is performing the group restart phase to recover the
shared communications area (SCA) for nonstarting member membname of the data sharing group.
This message is followed by message DSNR024I after the group restart phase to recover the SCA for the identified
member is complete.
System action: The subsystem continues the group restart process.
DSNR024I csect-name GROUP RESTART COMPLETED TO RECOVER THE SCA FOR GROUP MEMBER membname
Explanation: The DB2 subsystem that issued this message completed the group restart phase to recover the shared
communications area (SCA) for member membname of the data sharing group.
This message is issued only if messages DSNR021I and DSNR023I were issued.
System action: The subsystem continues the group restart process.
DSNR025I csect-name GROUP RESTART INITIATED TO RECOVER RETAINED LOCKS FOR GROUP MEMBER membname
Explanation: The DB2 subsystem that issued this message is performing the group restart phase to recover the
retained locks for nonstarting member membname of the data sharing group.
This message is followed by message DSNR026I after the group restart phase to recover the retained locks for the
identified member is complete.
System action: The subsystem continues the group restart process.
User response: Restart the failed member to release the retained locks.
DSNR026I csect-name GROUP RESTART COMPLETED TO RECOVER RETAINED LOCKS FOR GROUP MEMBER membname
Explanation: The DB2 subsystem that issued this message completed the group restart phase to recover the retained
locks for member membname of the data sharing group.
This message is issued only if messages DSNR021I and DSNR025I were issued.
System action: The subsystem continues the group restart process.
DSNR030I csect-name WILL CONTINUE WITHOUT THE member MEMBER'S LOG, REPLY 'YES' OR 'NO'
Explanation: The reply to message DSNR020I was 'QUIESCED'. This message is issued as a reminder that group
restart will continue without using the log from the identified member.
If you are sure that the identified member was quiesced the last time it was started, that is, it was stopped with a
-STOP DB2 MODE(QUIESCE) command and it stopped with no indoubt units of recovery and no distributed
resynchronization responsibility, then reply 'YES'; otherwise, reply 'NO'.
System action: This group member waits for a valid reply to this message.
v If the reply is 'YES', group restart continues without using the log from the identified member.
v If the reply is 'NO', message DSNR020I is reissued to allow you to enter a different response.
DSNR031I csect-name PROCESSING LOG RECORD AT RBA rba1 TO RBA rba2
Explanation: This message is produced periodically during the forward and backward processing phases of restart.
The RBA values in this message can be used to monitor the progress of the phases of restart.
Forward processing occurs between messages DSNR004I and DSNR005I. During forward processing, the log is read
in a forward direction.
Backward processing occurs between messages DSNR005I and DSNR006I. During backward processing, the log is
read in a backward direction and reading stops at the RBA that matches the URID of the oldest inflight or in-abort
UR.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
rba1 The RBA of the log record that is currently being processed.
rba2 The RBA of the last log record that is read in this phase of restart.
If rba1 is not progressing, restart might be suspended. Messages DSNR055I through DSN058I might accompany this
message and provide additional diagnostic information to help identify the cause of the suspension.
System action: DB2 restart continues.
Operator response: If rba1 is not progressing, notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If rba1 is not progressing, take one of the following actions:
v If messages DSNR055I through DSNR058I indicate the reason for the suspension, follow the instructions for those
messages to resolve the restart suspension.
v If messages DSNR055I through DSNR058I are not displayed or do not provide enough information, request SVC
dumps of the DB2 and IRLM address spaces for problem determination. For data sharing, request dumps from all
members of the data sharing group.
User response: No action is required.

DSNR034E csect-name THERE CANNOT BE MORE THAN TWO RELEASE LEVELS OF DB2 RUNNING IN THE GROUP
Explanation: You attempted to start a DB2 that was at a release level that cannot coexist in the data sharing group.
There are already two different releases of DB2 currently running in the data sharing group.
System action: DB2 terminates.
System programmer response: If you are sure that the startup procedure is pointing to the correct set of load
libraries, you must stop any DB2 subsystems that cannot coexist with the one you are attempting to start.

DSNR035I csect-name WARNING - UNCOMMITTED UR AFTER number CHECKPOINTS - CORRELATION NAME = correlation-name CONNECTION ID = connection-id LUWID = logical-unit-of-work-id=token PLAN NAME = plan-name AUTHID = authorization-id END USER ID = user-id TRANSACTION NAME = transaction-name WORKSTATION NAME = workstation-name
Explanation: This message indicates that during checkpoint processing, DB2 encountered an uncommitted unit of
recovery (UR) that has an inflight or indoubt status.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
number The cumulative number of checkpoints that were taken since the beginning of the UR.
correlation name
The correlation name for the thread that is associated with the UR.
connection-id
The connection ID for the thread that is associated with the UR.
logical-unit-of-work-id
The logical unit of work ID for the thread that is associated with the UR. An asterisk (*) denotes that the
thread originated at the local site.
This value consists of a fully qualified LU network name followed by a period and an LUW instance
number. The LU network name consists of a one- to eight-character network ID, a period, and a one- to
eight-character network LU name. The LUW instance number consists of 12 hexadecimal characters that
uniquely identify the unit of work.
token A unique token number that is associated with the logical unit of work ID.
If the UR is inflight, token refers to the thread in the report from the DISPLAY THREAD command with the
TYPE(ACTIVE) option.
If the UR is indoubt, token might not refer to the thread in the report from the DISPLAY THREAD command
with the TYPE(INDOUBT) option. However, in this case, you can use the logical unit of work ID to
determine the correct association.
plan-name
The plan for the thread that is associated with the UR.
authorization-id
The authorization ID for the thread that is associated with the UR.
user-id The user ID that is associated with the UR, if the thread was created with client user information.
Otherwise, an asterisk (*).
transaction-name
The transaction that is associated with the UR, if the thread was created with client user information.
Otherwise, an asterisk (*).
workstation-name
The workstation host name that is associated with the UR, if the thread was created with client user
information. Otherwise, an asterisk (*).
System action: Processing continues. If statistics class 3 is turned on, IFCID 0313 is written.
System programmer response: You can see the UR in the DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(ACTIVE) report or the
DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT) report. Depending on which report is relevant, take one of the following
actions:
If the UR is in the DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(ACTIVE) report:
Consult with the application programmer to determine whether this UR is problematic.
If the problematic UR is caused by an application program, you can use the CANCEL THREAD command
to roll back the UR, if necessary. Input to the command can be the logical-unit-of-work-id value or the token
value. The amount of time required for the backout process depends on the amount of work performed by
the UR.
For more information about problems caused by uncommitted URs, see the information about programming
for concurrency.
If the UR is in the DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT) report:
The UR is typically resolved automatically in a reasonable amount of time. However, in cases where the UR
is not resolved, consider using the RECOVER INDOUBT command to provide a commit or abort decision.
Input to the command can be the logical-unit-of-work-id value, the token value, or any other appropriate value
that is provided in the DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(INDOUBT) report. The amount of time required for the
backout process depends on the amount of work performed by the UR.
Programmer response: Ensure that the application commits frequently enough, or consult with your DB2
administrator about decreasing the frequency of the check for uncommitted URs. Use the URCHKTH subsystem

DSNR037I csect-name WARNING - THE TCP/IP DRDA PORT NUMBER IS CHANGED FROM port-1 TO port-2
Explanation: The TCP/IP DRDA port number specified in the DB2 BSDS is different from the value used the last
time a member of the DB2 data sharing group started. All members of a DB2 data sharing group must use the same
TCP/IP DRDA port number.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
port-1 The TCP/IP DRDA port number that was obtained from the coupling facility during DB2 startup. This value
is the TCP/IP DRDA port number that was used the last time a member of the data sharing group was
started.
port-2 The TCP/IP DRDA port number that was obtained from the DB2 BSDS during DB2 startup.
System action: DB2 accepts the new TCP/IP DRDA port number, and DB2 startup continues.
Operator response: Contact the system programmer.
System programmer response: If the TCP/IP DRDA port number was changed inadvertently, stop DB2
immediately. Use the change log inventory utility (DSNJU003) to correct the PORT value, and restart DB2.
If this message reflects a change that you want to make to the DB2 DRDA port number, no action is required. The
DRDA port number stored in the coupling facility is updated, and this new port number will be used when DB2
validates each member's DRDA port number.
DSNR038I csect-name WARNING - THE TCP/IP RESYNCHRONIZATION PORT NUMBER IS CHANGED FROM port_1 TO port_2
Explanation: The TCP/IP resynchronization port number obtained from the DDF record of the BSDS is different
than the value specified the last time DB2 started.
Changing the TCP/IP resynchronization port number can cause problems during distributed 2-phase commit
processing. Remote DRDA partners record DB2's resynchronization port number in their recovery logs. The
resynchronization port number is used to reconnect to the appropriate DB2 member when communication failures
occur during 2-phase commit processing. If a DB2 member changes its resynchronization port number, the remote
DRDA partners may be unable to resolve indoubt units of work.
port_1 The TCP/IP resynchronization port number that was obtained from the DB2 BSDS during DB2 startup.
port_2 The TCP/IP resynchronization port number that was obtained from the coupling facility during DB2 startup.
This is the TCP/IP resynchronization port number that was used the last time this member was started.
System action: DB2 accepts the new TCP/IP resynchronization port number, and DB2 startup continues.
Operator response: Contact the system programmer.
System programmer response: If the DB2 resynchronization port number was changed inadvertently, stop DB2
immediately. Use the change log inventory utility (DSNJU003) to correct the RESPORT value, and restart DB2.
If this message reflects a change that you want to make to DB2's resynchronization port number, no action is
required. The resynchronization port number stored in the coupling facility for this member is updated, and this new
port number will be used when DB2 validates the resynchronization port number for other DB2 members.
DSNR039I csect-name WARNING - TCP/IP RESYNCHRONIZATION PORT NUMBER port_1 IS THE SAME AS MEMBER member_name
Explanation: The TCP/IP resynchronization port of the starting DB2 is the same as the member indicated by
member_name.
port_1 The TCP/IP resynchronization port number that was obtained from the DB2 BSDS during DB2 startup.
member_name
The member name of the DB2 data sharing member that used the same resynchronization port number.
System action: The TCP/IP port number specified in the BSDS is accepted, and DB2 startup continues.
Operator response: Contact the system programmer.
System programmer response: Each member of the DB2 data sharing group should have a unique TCP/IP
resynchronization port number. Use the change log inventory utility (DSNJU003) to specify a unique RESPORT value
for this DB2 member and the DB2 member identified by member_name.
DSNR040I csect-name TRACKER RESTART ENDLRSN lrsn DOES NOT MATCH ENDLRSN lrsn ASSOCIATED WITH THE DATA SHARING GROUP
Explanation: In a data sharing environment, a TRKRSITE DB2 will not restart if it detects inconsistencies in the
reported values for ENDLRSN. The ENDLRSN specified on the Conditional Restart Control Record does not match
the ENDLRSN in the system communications area (SCA) structure for the data sharing group.
System action: DB2 startup terminates.
Operator response: Collect the SYS1.LOGREC and SVC dump, and contact the system programmer.
System programmer response: If the ENDLRSN value for this member is incorrect, take the following actions:
v Restore the BSDS and Logs for his Tracker DB2 from the primary DB2
v Ensure the Conditional Restart Control Record is correct
v Restart DB2
If the ENDLRSN value in the SCA is incorrect, delete the SCA structure and restart all members of the TRKRSITE
data sharing group with the same ENDLRSN.
DSNR042I csect-name WARNING - UR ROLLBACK HAS BEEN CANCELED AND IS INCOMPLETE FOR CORRELATION NAME = corrid CONNECTION ID = connid AUTHID = authid PLAN NAME = plan-name URID = urid
Explanation: DB2 issues this message when rollback for the indicated thread has been canceled by either the
CANCEL THREAD NOBACKOUT command or the RECOVER POSTPONED CANCEL command.
System action: Rollback processing for the thread stops and the unit of recovery is logged as canceled and
complete.
User response: Examine the console for messages indicating what objects are being marked as REFP,RECP; those
objects will need to be recovered.
DSNR043E csect-name DB2 IS STARTING WITH AN UNSUPPORTED CODE LEVEL. CURRENT LEVEL: current-code-level VALID LEVEL(S): valid-code-levels
Explanation: The DB2 that is starting is not at the proper code level. Some required maintenance, such as a fallback
or coexistence SPE, has not been applied. The level information is different for each SPE level and each release. This
information is for the use of your IBM service representative.
This message can occur in the following situations:
v The DB2 that is starting has completed a fallback from a later release and does not have the proper fallback SPE
applied.
v The DB2 that is starting does not have the proper coexistence SPE to start in a data sharing group, which is at a
later release level.
v The DB2 that is starting is not at a release level that supports coexistence with the data sharing group.
System action: DB2 terminates with reason code 00D900FA.
Operator response: Save the console output and inform the system programmer.
System programmer response: Check the DB2 Program Directory and Preventive Service Planning updates (PSP) to
determine what SPE you need.
Verify that:
v Coexistence is supported between the releases you are trying to run.
v The DB2 startup procedure points to the correct set of load libraries.
v The correct SPE has been applied.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Contents of the BSDS (both copies if dual BSDS in use) obtained by using the DB2 print log map (DSNJU004)
utility.
v Unformatted DSN1PRNT output of the DSNDB01.DBD01 page set. Use the method described in Part 5 of Diagnosis
Guide and Reference to locate the inconsistent DBD in the DSNDB01.DBD01 page set.
DSNR044E csect-name MEMBER member-name IS STARTED AT A LEVEL OF CODE started-code-level WHICH IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE STARTING MEMBER. VALID LEVEL(S) valid-code-levels
Explanation: The code levels are not compatible between the DB2 member that has already started and the DB2
member that is starting. You need to apply the correct SPE to the DB2 member that is at the earlier level.
The level information is different for each SPE level and each release. This information is for the use of your IBM
service representative.
This message occurs when a starting DB2 member is at a later release level that cannot coexist with an existing DB2
member.
System action: After detecting the first member with which it cannot coexist, DB2 terminates with reason code
00D900FA.
Operator response: Save the console output and inform the system programmer.
System programmer response: Check the Program Directory and Preventive Service Planning updates (PSP) to
ensure that all active members in the group have the proper SPE applied.
Verify that:
v Coexistence is supported between the releases you are trying to run.
v The DB2 startup procedure points to the correct set of load libraries.
v The correct SPE has been applied.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Contents of the BSDS (both copies if dual BSDS in use) obtained by using the DB2 print log map (DSNJU004)
utility.
v Unformatted DSN1PRNT output of the DSNDB01.DBD01 page set. Use the method described in Part 5 of Diagnosis
Guide and Reference to locate the inconsistent DBD in the DSNDB01.DBD01 page set.
DSNR045I csect-name DB2 SUBSYSTEM IS STARTING AND IT WAS NOT STARTED IN A PREVIOUS RELEASE WITH THE FALLBACK SPE APPLIED. FALLBACK SPE APAR: apar-number NEW RELEASE LEVEL: release KNOWN LEVEL(S): level
Explanation: DB2 was not started with the FALLBACK SPE active before an attempt was made to start DB2 in a
new release. The FALLBACK SPE must be applied, and the system must be started before DB2 can be started in a
new release.
release level
The release and level are different for each release, and are for the use of the IBM service representative.
apar-number
The apar-number is the FALLBACK SPE that is missing.
System action: DB2 terminates with reason code 00D96001.
User response: Ensure that the FALLBACK SPE is applied, and DB2 is started before starting DB2 in a new release.
DSNR046I csect-name INCOMPLETE UNITS OF RECOVERY EXIST FOR subsys
Explanation: This message is issued during DB2 shutdown if any incomplete units of recovery exist for the
referenced member of a data sharing group. The message indicates that retained locks will be held by subsystem
subsys.
System action: DB2 shutdown continues normally.
User response: Restart DB2 and resolve the incomplete units of recovery to release the retained locks held by
subsystem subsys.
DSNR047I csect-name POSTPONED ABORT BACKOUT PROCESSING LOG RECORD AT RBA rba1 TO RBA rba2
Explanation: This message is produced periodically during the backout processing of postponed abort units of
recovery, initiated by the -RECOVER POSTPONED command. The RBAs in this message can be used to monitor the
backout progress.
During the backout process, DB2 reads the log in a backward direction and stops reading the log at the RBA
matching the URID of the oldest postponed-abort UR rba2. rba1 is the RBA of the log record currently being
processed.
System action: Backout processing continues.
System programmer response: This is an information-only message. If the message continues to be issued and rba1
remains the same, make sure there are no outstanding archive tape mounts that may be delaying the log read
process. Otherwise, obtain a dump of the DB2 address spaces for problem determination.
The -DISPLAY THREAD TYPE(POSTPONED) command can be issued to display information about the postponed
abort units of recovery. It is also possible to stop the backout process with the -RECOVER POSTPONED CANCEL
command, but this will leave objects in an inconsistent state.
Related reference:
-RECOVER POSTPONED (DB2) (DB2 Commands)
-DISPLAY THREAD (DB2) (DB2 Commands)
DSNR048I csect-name UR BACKOUT PROCESSING LOG RECORD AT RBA rba1 TO RBA rba2 FOR CORRELATION NAME = correlation-name CONNECTION ID = connection-id LUWID = logical-unit-of-work-ID=token PLAN NAME = plan-name AUTHID = authorization-ID END USER ID = user-ID TRANSACTION NAME = transaction-name WORKSTATION NAME = workstation-name
Explanation: This message is produced periodically during the backout process of an in-abort unit of recovery. The
RBAs in this message can be used to monitor the backout progress. Together, CORRELATION NAME,
CONNECTION ID, and LUWID identify a thread associated with the UR. If the LUWID is '*', the thread originated
at this site. token is a unique token number associated with the LUWID. PLAN NAME and AUTHID further identify
the thread associated with the UR. If the thread was created with client user information, the user's USERID,
TRANSACTION NAME, and WORKSTATION NAME are displayed. Otherwise, these fields contain an '*'.
During the backout process, DB2 reads the log in a backward direction and stops reading the log at the RBA
matching the URID of the in-abort UR rba2. rba1 is the RBA of the log record currently being processed.
System action: Backout processing continues.
System programmer response: This is an information-only message. If the message continues to be issued and rba1
remains the same, make sure there are no outstanding archive tape mounts that might be delaying the log read
process. Otherwise, obtain a dump of the DB2 address spaces for problem determination.
It might be possible to stop the backout process with the NOBACKOUT option of the -CANCEL THREAD command,
but this leaves objects in an inconsistent state.

DSNR050I csect-name DB2 STARTED IN SYSTEM RECOVER PENDING MODE
Explanation: DB2 has started in System Recover Pending mode in preparation for the RESTORE SYSTEM utility. No
database update activity is allowed, and DB2 is in restricted access mode.
System action: DB2 startup continues.
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
DSNR051I csect-name SYSPITR RESTART ENDLRSN lrsn DOES NOT MATCH ENDLRSN lrsn ASSOCIATED WITH THE DATA SHARING GROUP
Explanation: For a System Level Recovery restart, all members of the data sharing group must truncate their logs
with the same LRSN value that was specified in the SYSPITR conditional restart parameter.
System action: DB2 startup terminates.
Operator response: Collect the SYS1.LOGREC and SVC dump, and contact the system programmer.
System programmer response: Ensure that the conditional restart control record is correct, and then restart DB2.
You can run the Print Log Map utility (DSNJU004) to examine the current conditional restart record.
DSNR052I csect-name DB2 MEMBER TO REMAIN ACTIVE IN LIGHT MODE TO RESOLVE INDOUBT UNITS OF RECOVERY
Explanation: This message is issued at the end of restart when the DB2 member has been restarted with the
LIGHT(YES) parameter and there are indoubt units of recovery (URs).
System action: The DB2 member remains up and running in light mode. This DB2 member will only allow
connections for the purpose of resolving the indoubt URs. Also, certain commands are allowed. Any attempt to
connect to this DB2 to submit new SQL work will be disallowed with reason code 00F300A2.
User response: Ensure that the appropriate commit coordinators are started so that they can resync with the DB2
member to resolve the indoubts. Alternatively the -RECOVER INDOUBT command can be used to manually resolve
the indoubts.
DSNR053I csect-name ALL INDOUBT UNITS OF RECOVERY HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. LIGHT MODE DB2 NORMAL TERMINATION TO FOLLOW
Explanation: This message is issued after all indoubt units of recovery are resolved for this DB2 member, which was
restarted with the LIGHT(YES) parameter.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
System action: DB2 subsystem shutdown is initiated.
User response: No action is required.

DSNR054I RESTART...BEGIN SCAN FOR CHECKPOINT
Explanation: DB2 must scan the log backwards to locate the prior checkpoint.
System action: After the prior checkpoint is located on the log, restart continues.
DSNR055I csect-name RESTART SUSPENDED SINCE time IN module offset maint-lvl
Explanation: This message is produced periodically during the recovery phase of a restart if DB2 detects that the
restart processor has remained suspended across a two minute interval. This message provides the time that the
restart processor has suspended, and, the module, offset, and maintenance level for the suspend request.
System action: DB2 restart continues.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If the message repeats every two minutes and DB2 restart does not appear to be
progressing, look for additional messages that could indicate the reason for the restart stall. If no other messages are
found, request SVC dumps of the DB2 and IRLM address spaces for problem determination. For data sharing,
request dumps from all members of the data sharing group.
DSNR056I csect-name RESTART SUSPENDED ON IRLM REQUEST. ONE HOLDER OF RESOURCE IS ss-name.  SERVICE INFO: IRLM FUNC func-cd, RESOURCE res-name.
Explanation: This message is produced periodically during the recovery phase of restart if DB2 detects that the
restart processor has remained suspended across a two minute interval on an IRLM request. If DB2 is suspended for
an IRLM lock in a data sharing environment, DB2 queries IRLM to determine what DB2 subsystem holds the lock. If
successful, ss-name contains the DB2 subsystem name. Otherwise, ss-name contains a series of eight asterisks
('********'). The function code and resource name for the IRLM request is also provided for serviceability.
System action: DB2 restart continues.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If the message repeats every two minutes and DB2 restart does not appear to be
progressing, the DB2 subsystem displayed in the message might need to be recycled to allow this subsystem to
restart. Request SVC dumps of the DB2 and IRLM address spaces before recycling any of the DB2 subsystems for
problem determination. For data sharing, request dumps from all members of the data sharing group.
DSNR057I csect-name RESOURCE INFORMATION: DBID X'dbid', PSID X'psid', PART X'part#'
Explanation: This message is produced periodically during the recovery phase of restart if DB2 detects that the
restart processor has remained suspended across a two minute interval on an IRLM request. If DB2 is suspended for
an IRLM lock in a data sharing environment, DB2 queries IRLM to determine what DB2 subsystem holds the lock.
This message indicates that the locked resource is a type which is held on a data base object. The dbid contains the
DBID and the psid contains the PSID in the case of a table space or ISOBID in the case of an index space. If the object
is a partition of a partitioned pageset, then the part# contains the partition number, otherwise it is zero.
System action: DB2 restart continues.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If the message repeats every two minutes and DB2 restart does not appear to be
progressing, then an agent running on the DB2 subsystem identified in message DSNR056I could be holding on to a
lock for an extended period of time, that is associated with the DBID, PSID, PART identified in this message. You
might be able to use the data base object identification information in this message to identify the specific object
which is encountering the problem. One way to check what object is encountering the problem is to query the DB2
catalog to find the data base name and pageset name, and then to use the DISPLAY DATABASE CLAIMERS or
DISPLAY DATABASE LOCKS commands to identify the agent that is holding the lock. If an agent can be identified,
you can cancel the agent to release the lock.
DSNR058I csect-name ACCESSING ARCHIVE LOG data-set-name
Explanation: This message is produced periodically during the recovery phase of restart if DB2 detects that the
restart processor has remained suspended across a two minute interval attempting to access an archive log data set.
The data-set-name contains the data set name of the archive log that DB2 is accessing.
System action: DB2 restart continues.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Look for and resolve any outstanding archive log tape mounts or HSM recall
requests that could be causing DB2 restart to stall. If this does not resolve the problem, request SVC dumps of the
DB2 and IRLM address spaces for problem determination.
DSNR059I csect-name GROUP INFORMATION IN THE SCA IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH A SYSPITR RESTART
Explanation: Group information in the shared communication area (SCA) indicates that the current SYSPITR restart
is invalid. All active members of the data sharing group must restart with the same SYSPITR conditional restart
value.
System action: DB2 startup terminates.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Make sure that all data sharing structures in the coupling facility have been deleted
before the first SYSPITR restart, and that all active members have been restarted with the same SYSPITR conditional
restart value.
DSNR060I csect-name THIS DB2 SUBSYSTEM IS MARKED AS DEACTIVATED AND CANNOT BE STARTED.
Explanation: An attempt was made to start a DB2 subsystem, but the DB2 subsystem that issued the message
cannot be started because its BSDS indicates that it has been deactivated.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
System action: An SVC dump is generated for abend 04E with reason code 00D10130. The restart is terminated.
System programmer response: Message DSNR060I usually indicates that a DB2 subsystem which has been
deactivated was started mistakenly. If the DB2 subsystem should not have been deactivated, use the change log
inventory utility (DSNJU003) to restore the member.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v The SVC dump
v The syslog and LOGREC entries from the time of the error

DSNS001I csect_name SUBSYSTEM HAS EXCEEDED THE USER SPECIFIED REAL STORAGE USAGE THRESHOLD
Explanation: You have requested to perform real storage monitoring by specifying a non-zero value for subsystem
parameter SPRMRSMX. DB2 has determined that the amount of real storage used has reached or exceeded the
amount of combined real and auxiliary storage allowed.
System action: The DB2 subsystem requests to record a DB2 SYS1.LOGREC entry, and an RC00E20033 abend dump
is requested before DB2 subsystem termination is initiated. The system terminates with:
*DSNV086E = DB2 ABNORMAL TERMINATION
REASON=00E20033
System programmer response: Determine whether the value specified for subsystem parameter, SPRMRSMX is
realistic. If you decide to contact IBM support, provide the DB2 SYS1.LOGREC entry and the RC00E20033 dump.
Also, you will most likely be asked to provide IFCID225 records, which show historical storage usage, in order to
determine what area is responsible for the real frame build up.
DSNS002I csect-name THE VALUE SPECIFIED FOR SUBSYSTEM PARAMETER REALSTORAGE_MAX IS EQUAL OR GREATER THAN AVAILABLE REAL STORAGE
Explanation: The value of the REALSTORAGE_MAX subsystem parameter is equal to or greater than the amount of
real storage that is available to the address space.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
System action: DB2 continues with normal startup.
System programmer response: Increase the specified value if appropriate. The specified value might be normal if
you expect that much of the real storage usage for the installation is to be paged out to auxiliary storage devices.
DSNS003I csect-nameSUBSYSTEM WARNING THRESHOLD FOR REAL STORAGE HAS BEEN DETECTED
Explanation: The system has consumed a critical amount of the real and auxiliary storage that is allotted to this DB2
subsystem by the REALSTORAGE_MAX subsystem parameter.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
System action: Processing continues but DB2 enters contraction mode if it is not already enabled. If real storage
growth continues and reaches the limit defined by the value of the REALSTORAGE_MAX subsystem parameter, DB2
terminates.
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
Operator response: If appropriate, increase the value of the REALSTORAGE_MAX subsystem parameter, and
determine why the real storage usage is approaching the maximum allowed. If possible, reduce the workload that is
entering this DB2 member until the condition is relieved.

DSNT107I INVALID AMODE OR RMODE ATTRIBUTE FOUND FOR LOAD MODULE module-name
Explanation: During DB2 startup, the service controller establishes the addressability to the DB2 database services
functional recovery and the emergency shutdown routines. Two load modules, DSNTF, and DSNTLCLE, are loaded
into CSA. In the MVS/XA environment, DSNTLCLE must be link-edited with attributes AMODE(24) and
RMODE(ANY). At least one of the modules did not have the correct addressing attribute when it was loaded.
'module-name' in the error message is the name of the first load module that has an invalid addressing mode.
System action: DB2 database services start up is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Verify that all installation and maintenance activities against these modules were
executed using SMP. Verify that the JCLIN for SMP includes the correct AMODE and RMODE control statements,
and that the linkage editor provided with the Data Facility Product (DFP) was invoked by SMP for the link edits.
Correct the procedure or JCL which caused the error and rerun the necessary SMP jobs.
Problem determination: A DB2 dump was requested to an MVS/XA SYS1.DUMP data set.
The MVS service aid AMBLIST provides linkage editor module attributes in the summary section of the LISTLOAD
function output.
DSNT108I DB2 HAS DETECTED A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECORDED SYSTEM CCSIDS AND THE CCSIDS SPECIFIED BY DSNHDECP
Explanation: During DB2 startup, DB2 detected a difference between the CCSIDs recorded in the BSDS and the
CCSIDs specified by the version of DSNHDECP, or the user-specified application defaults module, that was loaded
during startup. DB2 startup terminated to avoid potential data corruption issues.
System action: DB2 startup is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Determine the reason for the mismatch between the CCSIDs in the BSDS and the
CCSIDs specified by the dsnhdecp module that was loaded during startup. Possible reasons for a mismatch include
that the procedure used to start DB2 might have incorrect library concatenations, or, the copy of the dsnhdecp module
that was loaded was incorrectly copied to the libraries specified by the DB2 startup procedure.
Correct the mismatch. If IBM support directs you, you can use the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility with the
DELETE CCSIDS clause to delete the CCSIDs that are specified in the in the BSDS. Important: Do not attempt to
delete the CCSIDs in the BSDS unless IBM support instructs you.

DSNT109I DB2 HAS DETECTED AN INVALID CCSID IN THE CCSID(S) SPECIFIED FOR ENCODING SCHEME encoding-scheme BY DSNHDECP
Explanation: The version of DSNHDECP, or the user-specified application defaults module, that was loaded during
DB2 startup has invalid CCSIDs for the encoding-scheme encoding scheme. DB2 startup terminated to avoid potential
data corruption issues.
System action: DB2 startup is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If the dsnhdecp value for MIXED is NO, the specified CCSIDs must be SBCS CCSIDs.
You can find these CCSIDs in the table entitled "Single-byte coded character set identifiers (CCSIDs)".
If the dsnhdecp value for MIXED is YES, then you must select ASCII MIXED from the table entitled "ASCII
double-byte coded character set identifiers (CCSIDs)", and you must select EBCDIC MIXED CCSIDs from the table
entitled "EBCDIC double-byte coded character set identifiers (CCSIDs)".
Unicode CCSID values are pre-filled and you should not change them.

System programmer response: See other messages issued to determine the error that caused the bind subcommand
to terminate unsuccessfully.
DSNT202I MESSAGE LIMIT EXCEEDED
Explanation: A fixed amount of space exists in which to generate bind subcommand messages. This message says
that the bind subcommand generated more messages than will fit in that space.
System action: For bind subcommands that affect a single plan, the bind subcommand process continues. However,
no other messages are generated except for message DSNT200I or DSNT201I. For bind subcommands that affect more
than one plan, the bind subcommand process terminates and no other messages are generated.
System programmer response: The 'FLAG' parameter of the bind subcommand can be used to limit the types of
messages that are generated.
DSNT203I bind-type WARNING FOR object-type object-name DBRMS ARE CONVERTED INTO PACKAGES BEFORE bind-typeobject-typeobject-name.
Explanation: An attempt was made to bind DBRMs directly into a plan or to rebind a plan with DBRMs that were
already bound.
bind-type
The type of BIND subcommand, such as BIND or REBIND.
object-type
The type of object, such as PLAN.
object-name
The name of the application plan.
This message can be caused by using the MEMBER option when binding a plan or by rebinding a plan with DBRMs
that were bound in an earlier version of DB2.
System action: The bind process continues and the conversion is completed.
Operator response: No action is required.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNT204I bind-type WARNING FOR object-type object-name, option IS option-status, substitute-option WILL BE USED.
Explanation: A BIND subcommand was issued with an invalid option.
bind-type
The type of BIND subcommand, such as REBIND.

DSNT205I name IS A DUPLICATE name-type, IT WILL BE USED ONLY ONCE
Explanation: Name 'name' has been specified more than once in a list of names.
name Name that was specified more than once.
name-type
Indicates the type of list in which the name was duplicated.
v MEMBER NAME - List of DBRM Members
v PLAN-ID - List of plan IDs
v SYSTEM NAME - List of system connection names on a DISABLE or ENABLE list.
v PACKAGE NAME - List of package IDs
System action: Duplicates are removed from 'name-type' list and the bind process continues.
System programmer response: Verify the list that contains the duplicate. If the error is only in entering a name
incorrectly, which happens to duplicate another entry, enter the name correctly and reissue the bind statement. If the
entry is really a duplicate, no action is required.
DSNT206I bind-type WARNING FOR object-type object-name DEFAULT COLLECTION ID: DSN_DEFAULT_COLLID_object-name IS USED IN THE PACKAGE LIST, POSSIBLE DBRMS ORIGINALLY BOUND WITH THE bind-type HAVE BEEN CONVERTED INTO PACKAGES DURING EXECUTING THE object-type PRIOR TO bind-type
Explanation: The default collection ID (DSN_DEFAULT_COLLID_object-name) has been detected in the package list
of the plan during the rebind process.
The default collection ID is the result of an automatic conversion from DBRMs to packages within a plan. This
message is issued when such a plan is rebound again. This condition typically happens when the plan contains
DBRMs that were directly bound, but that the DBRMs have been converted into packages. This conversion usually
happens during an attempt to use the plan in a newer release of DB2 than the one in which it was created.
bind-type
The type of BIND subcommand, such as REBIND.
object-type
The type of object, such as PLAN.
object-name
The name of the application plan.
System action: The rebind process continues and the plan is rebound with the package list.
Operator response: No action is required.

DSNT210I bind-type AUTHORIZATION ERROR USING authorization-id AUTHORITY PLAN=plan-id PRIVILEGE=privilege
Explanation: The indicated authorization ID does not have the indicated privilege and therefore cannot invoke the
indicated BIND subcommand against the indicated application plan.
bind-type
Type of BIND subcommand: BIND, REBIND, FREE.
authorization ID
Authorization ID of the plan owner. Note: If you are using a trusted context, the token auth-id might return
a role instead of an authorization ID. A role is returned, if a role was in effect and the authorization
checking is performed against the role rather than the authorization ID of the session, when the condition
was encountered. The role is returned in the following format as a single token: ROLE: role-name.
plan-id Application plan specified in the BIND subcommand.
privilege
Missing privilege: BIND, BINDADD
System action: The BIND, REBIND, or FREE operation for 'plan-id' is not performed.
System programmer response: If the indicated privilege is BINDADD, then the privilege to invoke the BIND
subcommand with the ACTION(ADD) option must be granted to the indicated authorization ID. If the indicated
privilege is BIND, the privilege to invoke a BIND subcommand against the indicated application plan must be
granted to the indicated authorization ID.
DSNT211I REBIND FOR PLAN plan-id FAILED BECAUSE IBMREQD OF ibmreqd IS INVALID
Explanation: The IBMREQD column of the SYSIBM.SYSPLAN catalog table for the named plan contains an
unrecognizable character.
System action: The REBIND operation for the plan was not performed.
System programmer response: You must do a BIND ACTION(REPLACE) for this plan.
DSNT212I bind-type AUTHORIZATION ID auth-id IN THE OWNER KEYWORD IS INVALID
Explanation: The authorization ID specified in the OWNER keyword of the BIND or REBIND subcommand is
invalid. Specifying an owner that is not the primary authorization ID or one of the secondary IDs of the process
requires additional authority.
bind-type
Type of bind subcommand: BIND or REBIND
auth-id The authorization ID specified as owner.
If you are using a trusted context, the token auth-id might return a role instead of an authorization ID. A role
is returned, if a role was in effect and the authorization checking is performed against the role rather than
the authorization ID of the session, when the condition was encountered. The role is returned in the
following format as a single token: ROLE: role-name.
System action: The BIND or REBIND subcommand is not executed.
System programmer response: Rerun the subcommand and specify a valid authorization ID for the OWNER
keyword. If necessary, add the required authorization ID for this user to the security system.

DSNT228I BIND ERROR, ATTEMPTING TO REPLACE PACKAGE = package_name WITH version= (version2) BUT THIS VERSION ALREADY EXISTS
Explanation: An attempt is made to create a version of a package that already exists. The version specified in the
REPLVER keyword is different from the version specified for the precompile. The version specified for the
precompile already exists in the catalog. The combination of 'location.collection.package.version' must be unique in
the SYSIBM.SYSPACKAGE catalog table. A common mistake is that the user may believe that the version he is
creating is the one specified in the REPLVER keyword. This is not the case. The version specified in the REPLVER
keyword is the name of the version being replaced. The version that will be created is the version that was given to
the program when it was precompiled.
package_name
Fully qualified package name
version2
Version-id of package that is to be created
System action: The bind will fail.
System programmer response: There are two approaches to solve this problem. The first is to re-precompile the
program with a new version name and re-issue the original BIND subcommand. The other approach is not to do the
precompile but re-issue the BIND subcommand without the REPLVER parameter.
DSNT229I BIND ERROR, ATTEMPTING TO REPLACE PACKAGE = package-name THERE ARE ENABLE OR DISABLE ENTRIES CURRENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PACKAGE
Explanation: The BIND subcommand was issued to replace a package that has ENABLE or DISABLE entries
currently associated with the package. The individual variable fields contain:
package-name
Name of the package (location.collection.package)
System action: Package not bound.
System programmer response: FREE the package first and then BIND the package.
DSNT230I BIND DBRM MEMBER NAME ERROR USING auth-id AUTHORITY object-type = object-name MEMBER dbrm-name NOT FOUND IN PDS SEARCH ORDER
Explanation: The indicated 'dbrm-name' was not found in the search order in the PDSs specified on the BIND
PLAN or BIND PACKAGE subcommand.
auth-id Authorization ID of the plan or package owner. Attention: If you are using a trusted context, the token
auth-id might return a role instead of an authorization ID. A role is returned, if a role was in effect and the
authorization checking is performed against the role rather than the authorization ID of the session, when
the condition was encountered. The role is returned in the following format as a single token: ROLE:
role-name.
object-type
The type of object being bound: PLAN or PACKAGE
object-name
If 'object-type' is PLAN, 'object-name' is the name of the application plan. Otherwise, it is the name of the
package in 'location.collection.package' format.
dbrm-name
Member name of the DBRM that was not found.
System action: The bind is unsuccessful.
System programmer response: Determine if an incorrect 'dbrm-member-name' or PDS was specified. Reinvoke the
BIND subcommand specifying the correct names.
DSNT231I BIND DBRM ERROR USING auth-id AUTHORITY object-type = object-name DBRM dbrm-name IS IN AN INCONSISTENT STATE
Explanation: The contents of a DBRM have been modified after the precompilation process, or the DBRM contains
incorrect information in the header.
auth-id Authorization ID of the invoker of the BIND subcommand. Attention: If you are using a trusted context, the
token auth-id might return a role instead of an authorization ID. A role is returned, if a role was in effect and
the authorization checking is performed against the role rather than the authorization ID of the session,
when the condition was encountered. The role is returned in the following format as a single token: ROLE:
role-name.
object-type
The type of object being bound: PLAN or PACKAGE
object-name
If 'object-type' is PLAN, 'object-name' is the name of the application plan. Otherwise, it is the name of the
package in 'location.collection.package' format.
dbrm-name
Name of the DBRM that is in error.
System action: The bind is unsuccessful.

Explanation: A fixed amount of space exists in which to generate bind subcommand messages. This message says
that the bind subcommand generated more messages than will fit in that space.
System action: For bind subcommands that affect a single package, the bind subcommand process continues.
However, no other messages are generated except for completion message DSNT232I or DSNT233I. For bind
subcommands that affect more than one package, the bind subcommand process terminates and no other messages
are generated.
System programmer response: The 'FLAG' parameter of the bind subcommand may be used to limit the types of
messages that are generated.
DSNT235I csect-name bind-type AUTHORIZATION ERROR USING auth-id AUTHORITY PACKAGE = package-name PRIVILEGE = privilege
Explanation: The authorization ID given does not have the privilege indicated and cannot invoke the bind
subcommand on the named package.
bind-type
Type of bind subcommand: BIND, REBIND, or FREE
auth-id Authorization ID of the invoker of the BIND subcommand. Attention: If you are using a trusted context, the
token auth-id might return a role instead of an authorization ID. A role is returned, if a role was in effect and
the authorization checking is performed against the role rather than the authorization ID of the session,
when the condition was encountered. The role is returned in the following format as a single token: ROLE:
role-name.
package-name
Name of the package in the following format: 'location.collection.package.(version)'
privilege
Name of the privilege not held:
BINDADD or BINDADD *
The authority to create a new package using BIND with the ADD option.
BIND The authority to BIND (REPLACE) or REBIND a package.

The authority to add a new version of an existing package using BIND with the ADD option.
FREE There is no FREE privilege, but the user needs the proper authority to free the package.
COPY The authority to COPY from the indicated package.
CREATE IN or CREATE IN *
The authority to create a package in the indicated collection.
A blank and asterisk ( *) in the privilege values 'BINDADD *', 'BIND *', and 'CREATE IN *' in the message indicates
that the BINDNV subsystem parameter has the value BIND. When ' *' does not appear in these privilege values, the
BINDNV subsystem parameter has the value BINDADD.
The BINDNV subsystem parameter affects the authorization required to add a new package or a new version of an
existing package to a collection.
System action: The indicated package is not bound, rebound, or freed.
System programmer response: You must grant the indicated privilege to the authorization ID of the package owner.

DSNT236I REBIND FOR PACKAGE package-name FAILED BECAUSE IBMREQD OF ibmreqd IS INVALID
Explanation: The IBMREQD column of the SYSIBM.SYSPACKAGE catalog table for the named package contains an
unrecognizable character. This usually means that the package depends on a function of DB2 which is not supported
by the currently active release.
package-name
Name of the package in the following format: 'location.collection.package.(version)'
System action: The package was not rebound.
System programmer response: Warn users not to use the package until the DB2 subsystem is remigrated to the
newer release.
DSNT237I csect-name BIND sub-type ERROR USING auth-id AUTHORITY PACKAGE = package-name ALREADY EXISTS
Explanation: An attempt is made to add a package that already exists. The combination of
'location.collection.package.version' must be unique in the SYSIBM.SYSPACKAGE table. In addition, the combination
of 'location.collection.package.consistency-token' must be unique.
sub-type
The sub-type can have the values: COPY, ADD or REPLACE.
auth-id Authorization ID of the owner of the package. Attention: If you are using a trusted context, the token
auth-id might return a role instead of an authorization ID. A role is returned, if a role was in effect and the
authorization checking is performed against the role rather than the authorization ID of the session, when
the condition was encountered. The role is returned in the following format as a single token: ROLE:
role-name.
package-name
Name of the package in the following format: 'location.collection.package.(version)'
System action: No package is created.
System programmer response: Check the SYSIBM.SYSPACKAGE catalog table for names of existing application
packages. Re-invoke the BIND subcommand with a 'location.collection.package.version' that is not in use.
DSNT238I bind-type error-type USING auth-id AUTHORITY PACKAGE = package-name DOES NOT EXIST
Explanation: The indicated subcommand was issued against a package that does not exist. The individual variable
fields contain:

DSNT300I AUTH-ID authorization-id NOT AUTHORIZED TO PERFORM function ON DATABASE dbname.  REQUEST REJECTED
Explanation: The invoker's 'authorization-id' as designated by AUTHORIZATION ID is not authorized to perform
the specified database control command function on this database. The 'function' is either -START, -STOP, or
-DISPLAY. The name of the database is 'dbname'.
If the operation involves an implicit database or an object in an implicit database, then the applicable privilege is not
held on the implicit database, on database DSNDB04. In this case, the owner of the object is not involved in
performing the operation.
System action: The request is rejected.
System programmer response: The privilege to issue the command must be granted to the indicated
'authorization-id'.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
If the table space is in an implicit database, then obtain the appropriate authorization privileges on the implicit
database or DSNDB04.
DSNT301I INVALID DATABASE dbname

System programmer response: Reissue the command with a valid name.
DSNT302I INVALID NAME spname
Explanation: In the message, 'spname' is the name of the table space or index space. The 'spname' specified in the
SPACENAM keyword on the -START, -STOP, or -DISPLAY DATABASE command does not exist.
System action: The request is rejected. This message may be repeated.
System programmer response: Reissue the command with a valid table space name or index name.
DSNT304I csect-name INSTALLATION SYSOPR IS NOT AUTHORIZED TO CHANGE OBJECT STATUS ON DATABASE dbname. REQUEST IS REJECTED.
Explanation: INSTALLATION SYSOPR is not authorized to perform the START DATABASE command function on
this database because the command can change an objects status in this database. INSTALL SYSOPR can use the
START DATABASE command only to recover LPL pages or GRECP objects. The name of the database is dbname.
System action: The request is rejected.
Operator response: Reissue the -START DATABASE command using the correct access mode or contact your system
programmer.
DSNT305I SUBSYSTEM FAILURE DURING command-name DATABASE COMMAND PROCESSING. RC = return-code, REASON = reason-code
Explanation: An error occurred while processing a DB2 command.
command-name
The name of the command that was being processed when the failure occurred. command-name can have one
of the following values:
DISPLAY
DISPLAY DATABASE command
START START DATABASE command
STOP STOP DATABASE command
return-code and reason-code
The reason for the error.
return-code is a 4-byte return code.
reason-code is a 4-byte reason code.
The values of return-code and reason-code depend on which control section (CSECT) issued the message, as
follows:
CSECT DSNTDCST:
v For relational data system (RDS) subcomponent errors:
C return-code is 8.
C reason-code is abend code 00E30085.
v For data manager (DM) subcomponent errors:
C return-code consists of a 2-byte return code and a 2-byte reason code that is returned by the
data manager function that is invoked by DSNTDCST.
C reason-code is abend code 00E30086.
A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested before the execution unit is
abended.
CSECT DSNTDDIS:
v return-code is 12.
v reason-code is abend code 00E30089.
The request is abended.
CSECTs DSNTDMUL or DSNTDMSG:
v return-code is a return code that is returned by the message generator.
v reason-code is abend code 00E30084.
The request is abended.
CSECT DSNTDSTP:
v return-code is 00000074.
v reason-code is internal reason code 00E30064.
The STOP DATABASE command has failed.
This internal reason code indicates that an unexpected error occurred during DB2 catalog lookup
for the STOP DATABASE command. Review the current messages in the DB2 MSTR address space
and retry the command after any related error conditions have been corrected.
System action: The actions are described in the explanation for each CSECT.
System programmer response: Refer to the information for the particular abend reason code that was issued.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.

DSNT306I RESPONSE MESSAGE LIMIT HAS BEEN REACHED
Explanation: A fixed amount of space exists in which to generate DISPLAY, START, or STOP database command
messages. This message indicates that the DISPLAY, START, or STOP database command that was specified generated
more messages than will fit in that space.
User response: Specify individual databases and/or table spaces rather than specifying '*' (that is, all names).
DSNT307I INVALID RANGE SPECIFICATION string1 IS GREATER THAN string2
Explanation: A range was specified on a DISPLAY DB(string1:string2) or DISPLAY DB(..)
SPACENAM(string1:string2) command or on a database command (START DB, STOP DB, or DISPLAY DB) on
PART(string1:string2) keywordwhere the first string, specified alphanumerically, collates after the second string.
User response: Specify the command again. Make sure the first string does not alphanumerically collate after the
second string specified.
DSNT308I AFTER KEYWORD ONLY VALID FOR A SINGLE DATABASE OR A SINGLE TABLESPACE/ INDEXSPACE WITHIN A DATABASE. REQUEST REJECTED
Explanation: The AFTER keyword may be specified by one of the following:
v A single database name after the keyword DATABASE
v A single table space name or index space name after the keyword SPACENAM.
User response: Specify the command correctly.
DSNT309I csect-name object_name IS CURRENTLY state.
Explanation: One of the following is already in the requested state:
v A database listed in START DB(list) or STOP DB(list)
v A table space listed in START DB(name) SPACENAM(list) or STOP DB(name) SPACENAM(list)
v An index space listed in START DB(name) SPACENAM(list) or STOP DB(name) SPACENAM(list)
v A partition of a partitioned table space listed in START DB(list) SPACENAM(list) PART(n), STOP DB(list)
SPACENAM(list) PART(n), START DB(list) SPACENAM(list), or STOP DB(list) SPACENAM(list)
In the message:
v The 'object' is the database, table space, index space or partition number with table space name or the index space
name.
C TABLESPACE, if the specified table space was currently in the requested state
C INDEXSPACE, if the specified index space was currently in the requested state
C DATABASE, if the database was currently in the requested state
C PARTITION, if the specified partition of a partitioned table space or partitioned index was currently in the
requested state
v The 'state' is:
C START RW, if the specified object is currently started read/write
C START RO, if the specified object is currently started read only
C START UT, if the specified object is currently started for utility processing
C STOPPED, if the specified object is currently stopped or is stopping
C STOP PENDING, if the specified object currently is in stop pending status.
If there are pages in the logical page list (LPL) for the object, or if the object is in group buffer pool recovery pending
(GRECP) status, a START DATABASE ACCESS(RO) or START DATABASE ACCESS(RW) command triggers a
recovery of that object even if this message is issued for that object. For each object that has LPL or GRECP recovery
that is initiated, DB2 issues a DSNI006 message followed by either a DSNI021 message (when the recovery completes
successfully) or a DSNI005 message (when the recovery is unsuccessful).
User response: No response is necessary. This message is informational only.
DSNT310I csect-name ALL object CURRENTLY state.
Explanation: A database and all of its table spaces and index spaces are already in the requested state. This occurred
following the processing of one of these commands:
v START DB(*)
v STOP DB(name)
v START DB(name) SPACENAM(*)
v STOP DB(name) SPACENAM(*).
In this message:
v The 'object' is either:
C TABLESPACE(S) if the specified table space was currently in the requested state
C INDEXSPACE(S) if the specified index space was currently in the requested state
C DATABASE(S) if the database was currently in the requested state.
v The 'state' is either:
C START RW if the specified table space is currently started read/write
C START RO if the specified table space is currently started read only
C START UT if the specified table space is currently started for utility processing
C STOPPED if the specified table space is currently stopped, has a stop pending against it, or is stopping.
If there are pages in the logical page list (LPL) for the object, or if the object is in group buffer pool recovery pending
(GRECP) status, a START DATABASE ACCESS(RO) or START DATABASE ACCESS(RW) command triggers a
recovery of that object even if this message is issued for that object. For each object that has LPL or GRECP recovery
that is initiated, DB2 issues a DSNI006 message followed by either a DSNI021 message (when the recovery completes
successfully) or a DSNI005 message (when the recovery is unsuccessful).
User response: No response is necessary. This message is informational only.
DSNT311I MESSAGE LIMIT EXCEEDED. DISPLAY IS TERMINATED.
Explanation: The number of messages generated exceeds the maximum number of messages specified in the LIMIT
keyword or exceeds the system default.
DSNT312I object name MUST BE STARTED RW. NO ACTION TAKEN.
Explanation: The ACCESS keyword is either RO or UT, and the object must be started ACCESS (RW).
In the message, 'object' is either:
v TABLESPACE(S) IN if the START DB(name) SPACENAM(...) is specified, or
v DATABASE if the START DB(name) is specified.
DSNT313I ACCESS(FORCE) IS VALID ONLY WITH EXPLICIT TABLESPACE OR INDEXSPACE NAMES.  COMMAND IS REJECTED
Explanation: The ACCESS(FORCE) keyword can be specified when either:
v A single table space or index space name appears after the keyword SPACENAM in a START DATABASE
command.
v A list of table space and/or index space names appears after the keyword SPACENAM in a START DATABASE
command.
Operator response: Specify the command correctly.
DSNT314I csect_name INVALID PARTITION SPECIFICATION FOR OBJECT object-name
Explanation: The PART keyword is invalidly specified in a START DATABASE, STOP DATABASE, or DISPLAY
DATABASE command.
The PART keyword is invalid if it is specified for:
v A nonpartitioned table space
v A nonpartitioned type 1 index
v A type 2 index not defined on a partitioned table space
The object object-name can be either a table space or an index space.
No action for this table space or index space is performed by the START DATABASE, STOP DATABASE or DISPLAY
DATABASE command.Any other valid table space or index space specified is processed by the command.
System action: The command is not processed for the table space or index space in question. All other valid table
spaces or index spaces specified in the command are processed.
User response: Resubmit the command for the nonpartitioned table space or index space without using the PART
keyword.
Problem determination: SYSIBM.SYSTABLESPACE in the DB2 catalog indicates whether a table space is partitioned.
SYSIBM.SYSINDEXSPACE in the DB2 catalog indicates whether an index space is partitioned and whether the index
space is a type 1 or a type 2 index. Type 2 nonpartitioned indexes can be started, stopped, or displayedat the logical
partition level; type 1 cannot.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNT315I csect_name INVALID PARTITION NUMBER OR RANGE SPECIFIED - part-numFOR OBJECT object-name
Explanation: An invalid partition number or rangewas specified in the PART keyword for a START DATABASE,
STOP DATABASE or DISPLAY DATABASE command.
Partition number or range part-numis invalid for the object object-name.
System action: The part number or rangeis ignored. All other valid partitions specified are processed if PART was
specified as list.
User response: Determine the correct partition specification for the table space or index that was the subject of the
specified command and resubmit the command.
Problem determination: SYSIBM.SYSTABLESPACE in the DB2 catalog indicates the correct range of partition
numbers for the table space. SYSIBM.SYSINDEXSPACE in the DB2 catalog indicates whether an index space is
partitioned and whether the index space is a type 1 or a type 2 index. Type 2 indexes can be started, stopped, or
displayedat the logical partition level; type 1 cannot.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNT316I csect-name A LOGICAL PARTITION OF AN INDEX WHICH HAS PAGES IN THE LPL OR HAS BEEN MARKED GRECP CANNOT BE STARTED FOR RW OR RO ACCESS
Explanation: The START DATABASE command was specified for a logical partition of a nonpartitioned index which
has pages in the logical page list (LPL) or is marked group buffer pool recovery pending (GRECP). To start a
nonpartitioned index with one of these exception conditions, the START DB command must be specified without the
PART keyword.
System action: The command is not processed for the index space. All other valid table spaces or index spaces
specified in the command are processed.
User response: Submit the command for the nonpartitioned index space without using the PART keyword.
Problem determination: If more information on the status of the index space is required, use the -DISPLAY
DATABASE command.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNT317I csect-name ANY USER-DEFINED INDEXES ON DSNDB06 COULD NOT BE cmd-type DUE TO A RESOURCE UNAVAILABLE ON THE CATALOG OR DIRECTORY.
Explanation: If user-defined indexes exist on DSNDB06, they could not be displayed, started or stopped (depending
on cmd-type) because the catalog or directory was not available. DB2-defined indexes and table spaces are not affected
by this unavailability.
System action: Any user-defined indexes on DSNDB06 were not affected by the command issued. All other table
spaces and index spaces were processed by the command.
Programmer response: When you get this message, correct the resource unavailable problem and reissue the
command.
DSNT318I csect-name PLAN=plan-name WITH CORRELATION-ID=correlation-id CONNECTION-ID=connection-id LUW-ID=luw-id THREAD-INFO=thread-information TIMED OUT BECAUSE OF A P-LOCK HELD BY MEMBER member-name
Explanation: A plan cannot get an IRLM lock because the resource is held by a P-lock in the data sharing group,
and the maximum amount of time to wait for the locked resource was exceeded.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
plan-name
The name of the executing plan that is associated with this thread.
correlation-id
The correlation identifier of the thread that is associated with the plan identified by plan-id. Correlation IDs
that begin with values between 001 and 028 identify system agents.
connection-id
The connection identifier of the plan identified by plan-name.
luw-id The logical unit of work identifier (LUWID) of plan-name.
* The thread does not have a LUWID.
luw-id=token
The logical unit of work ID and a five-digit token value. The token value can be used in any DB2
command that accepts a LUWID as input.
thread-information
Information about the thread. The information is presented in a colon-delimited list that contains the
following segments:
v The primary authorization ID that is associated with the thread.
v The name of the user's workstation.
v The ID of the user.
v The name of the application.
v The statement type for the previously executed statement: dynamic or static.
v The statement identifier for the previously executed statement, if available. The statement identifier can be
used to identify the particular SQL statement. For static statements, the statement identifier correlates to
the STMT_ID column in the SYSIBM.SYSPACKSTMT table. For dynamic statements, the statement
identifier correlates to the STMT_ID column in the DSN_STATEMENT_CACHE_TABLE table. That
statement might not have contributed to the current failure.
v The name of the role that is associated with the thread.
v The correlation token that can be used to correlate work at the remote system with work performed at the
DB2 subsystem. The correlation token, if available, is enclosed in '<' and '>' characters, and contains three
components, separated by periods:
C A 3 to 39 character IP address.
C A 1 to 8 character port address.
C A 12 character unique identifier.
An asterisk (*) in any segment indicates that the information is not available.
member-name
The name of the member of theDB2 subsystem that holds the conflicting P-lock.
System action: Processing continues.
The SQLCA that corresponds to the correlation ID, connection ID, and LUWID contains the name of the resource that
is involved in the timeout and one of the following SQL codes: -904, -911 , -913, or -923.
System programmer response: Identify the member that holds the P-lock and determine why the P-lock is not
being released. If the problem persists and no other method of releasing the P-lock can be found, consider recycling
the member of the group holding the P-lock.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v SYSABEND, SYSUDUMP, or SYSMDUMP output.

DSNT320I csect-name bind-type FOR PACKAGE = package-name FAILED. bind-type OPTION option-name IS USED BUT IS INVALID BECAUSE DB2 SUBSYSTEM PARAMETER ACCEL = NO, AND THIS DB2 SUBSYSTEM IS NOT ENABLED FOR QUERY ACCELERATION.
Explanation: A BIND or REBIND PACKAGE that specifies the QUERYACCELERATION or GETACCELARCHIVE
bind options failed because the DB2 subsystem is not enabled for query acceleration.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
bind-type
The type of bind subcommand: BIND or REBIND.
package-name
The fully qualified name of the package in the following format: 'location.collection.package.(version)'.
option-name
The bind option QUERYACCELERATION or GETACCELARCHIVE.
System action: The named package is not bound.
User response: Change the value of the ACCEL subsystem parameter to AUTO or COMMAND to enable the DB2
subsystem for query acceleration. You cannot change the ACCEL subsystem parameter online. You must stop and
restart DB2 for a change to ACCEL to take effect.
If you cannot change the ACCEL subsystem parameter, you must remove the QUERYACCELERATION and
GETACCELARCHIVE bind options.
DSNT321I csect-name bind-type FOR PACKAGE = package-name FAILED. bind-type OPTION option-name IS USED BUT IS INVALID BECAUSE THE DB2 TABLE SYSACCEL.SYSACCELERATEDPACKAGES OR ITS INDEXES DO NOT EXIST OR ARE NOT DEFINED CORRECTLY.
Explanation: A BIND or REBIND PACKAGE that specifies the QUERYACCELERATION or GETACCELARCHIVE
bind options failed because the DB2 table SYSACCEL.SYSACCELERATEDPACKAGES or its indexes do not exist or
are not defined correctly. These bind options require that these SYSACCEL objects are created correctly before
running BIND or REBIND PACKAGE.
DB2 supplies the DDL for these objects in job DSNTIJAS. If the DDL was run but modified from its original form, the
objects might not be created according to the correct specifications.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
bind-type
The type of bind subcommand: BIND or REBIND.
package-name
The fully qualified name of the package in the following format: 'location.collection.package.(version)'.

The bind option QUERYACCELERATION or GETACCELARCHIVE.
System action: The named package is not bound.
User response: Create the SYSACCEL.SYSACCELERATEDPACKAGES table and its indexes by running the DDL
that is supplied in job DSNTIJAS. Do not modify the DDL unless directed by IBM Support. If the DDL was modified
incorrectly, contact IBM Support for assistance.
If you cannot correctly create the SYSACCEL.SYSACCELERATEDPACKAGES table and its indexes, you must remove
the QUERYACCELERATION and GETACCELARCHIVE bind options.
DSNT322I csect-name bind-type FOR PACKAGE = package-name FAILED, BECAUSE THE DB2 TABLE SYSACCEL.SYSACCELERATEDPACKAGES OR ITS INDEXES ARE NOT DEFINED CORRECTLY.
Explanation: A REBIND or BIND COPY PACKAGE failed because the SYSACCEL.SYSACCELERATEDPACKAGES
table or its indexes exist but are not defined correctly. Even though the QUERYACCELERATION or
GETACCELARCHIVE bind options are not specified on the REBIND or BIND COPY subcommand, if these
SYSACCEL objects exist, DB2 must read the SYSACCEL.SYSACCELERATEDPACKAGES table to determine if the
package was previously bound with QUERYACCELERATION. If these SYSACCEL objects do not exist, DB2 does not
try to use them if REBIND or BIND COPY does not specify the QUERYACCELERATION or GETACCELARCHIVE
options.
DB2 supplies the DDL for these objects in job DSNTIJAS. If the DDL was run but modified from its original form, the
objects might not be created according to the correct specifications.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
bind-type
The type of bind subcommand: BIND or REBIND.
package-name
The fully qualified name of the package in the following format: 'location.collection.package.(version)'.
System action: The named package is not bound.
User response: If you want DB2 to use the SYSACCEL.SYSACCELERATEDPACKAGES table and its indexes, verify
that you ran the DDL that is supplied in job DSNTIJAS. Do not modify the DDL unless directed by IBM Support. If
the DDL was modified incorrectly, contact IBM Support for assistance.
If you cannot correctly create the SYSACCEL.SYSACCELERATEDPACKAGES table and its indexes, you must remove
the QUERYACCELERATION and GETACCELARCHIVE bind options.
DSNT323I csect-name bind-type FOR PACKAGE = package-name FAILED. bind-type OPTION option-name IS USED BUT IS INVALID BECAUSE THE DB2 SYSACCEL TABLES OR INDEXES DO NOT EXIST OR ARE NOT DEFINED CORRECTLY.
Explanation: A BIND or REBIND PACKAGE that specifies the QUERYACCELERATION or GETACCELARCHIVE
bind options failed because the DB2 SYSACCEL tables or indexes do not exist or are not defined correctly. These bind
options require that these SYSACCEL objects are created correctly before running BIND or REBIND PACKAGE.
DB2 supplies the DDL for the SYSACCEL objects in job DSNTIJAS. If the DDL was run but modified from its
original form, the objects might not be created according to the correct specifications.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
bind-type
The type of bind subcommand: BIND or REBIND.
package-name
The fully qualified name of the package in the following format: 'location.collection.package.(version)'.
option-name
The bind option QUERYACCELERATION or GETACCELARCHIVE.
System action: The named package is not bound.
User response: Create the DB2 SYSACCEL objects by running the DDL that is supplied in job DSNTIJAS. Do not
modify the DDL unless directed by IBM Support. If the DDL was modified incorrectly, contact IBM Support for
assistance.
If you cannot correctly create the SYSACCEL objects, you must remove the QUERYACCELERATION and
GETACCELARCHIVE bind options.
DSNT324I csect-name bind-type FOR PACKAGE = package-name FAILED, BECAUSE THE DB2 SYSACCEL TABLES OR INDEXES ARE NOT DEFINED CORRECTLY.
Explanation: A REBIND or BIND COPY PACKAGE failed because DB2 detected that SYSACCEL objects exist but
are not defined correctly. Even though the QUERYACCELERATION or GETACCELARCHIVE bind options are not
specified on the REBIND or BIND COPY subcommand, if these SYSACCEL objects exist DB2 must use them to
determine if the package was previously bound with QUERYACCELERATION. If these SYSACCEL objects do not
exist, DB2 does not use them if REBIND or BIND COPY do not specify QUERYACCELERATION or
GETACCELARCHIVE.
DB2 supplies the DDL for these objects in job DSNTIJAS. If the DDL was run but modified from its original form, the
objects might not be created according to the correct specifications.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
bind-type
The type of bind subcommand: BIND or REBIND.
package-name
The fully qualified name of the package in the following format: 'location.collection.package.(version)'.
System action: The named package is not bound.
User response: If you want DB2 to use the SYSACCEL objects that you created, verify that you ran the DDL that is
supplied in job DSNTIJAS. Do not modify the DDL unless directed by IBM Support. If the DDL was modified
incorrectly, contact IBM Support for assistance.
If you cannot correctly create the SYSACCEL objects, you must remove the QUERYACCELERATION and
GETACCELARCHIVE bind options.
DSNT331I csect-name DATABASE name AND ANY SPACE IT CONTAINS CANNOT BE STOPPED. IT IS THE ACTIVE COMMUNICATIONS DATABASE
Explanation: The database specified in the message cannot be stopped because it is the active communications
database. In addition, spaces within the active communications database cannot be stopped.
System action: Nothing is stopped.
Operator response: If the database or any space within it must be stopped, you must stop the distributed data
facility (STOP DDF). In a DB2 data sharing environment, you must stop the distributed data facility on all members
of the DB2 data sharing group.
DSNT332I TABLESPACES AND INDEXSPACES ARE UNAVAILABLE BECAUSE DATABASE name IS STOPPED
Explanation: The database 'name' is currently marked as stopped. Consequently, its table spaces and index spaces
are unavailable even though they may have been started.
DSNT336I bind-type FOR PACKAGE = package-name FAILED BECAUSE OF THE USE OF keyword. ONE OR MORE STATEMENTS WERE NOT SUCCESSFULLY PROCESSED.
Explanation: The subcommand failed because APCOMPARE or APREUSE was not successfully processed for
remote BIND or REBIND PACKAGE. This message is issued for remote BIND or REBIND only. One of the following
conditions occurred:
v APCOMPARE(ERROR) was specified and the use of APCOMPARE resulted in some statements where comparison
is not successful or comparison could not be performed.
v APREUSE(ERROR) was specified and the use of APREUSE resulted in some statements where APREUSE is either
not successful or partially successful, or APREUSE could not be performed, or APREUSE was suppressed by other

Explanation: This message follows message DSNT394I or DSNT396I for each thread reported that is participating in
distributed data access (database access thread). This additional line reports the distributed identification as follows:
luw-id=token
The logical-unit-of-work identifier (LUW-ID) is a unique identifier that is assigned to the thread followed by
an '=' sign and a token. The token can be used in place of luw-id in any DB2 command that accepts luw-id
as input.

The LOCATION name assigned to the requesting site.
The message number and subsystem recognition character are not included in this message.
DSNT352I AGENT TOKEN agent token
Explanation: This message is part of the output from the DISPLAY DATABASE command, which is described in
message DSNT361I on page 506.
DSNT358I csect_name INVALID PARTITION SPECIFICATION FOR OBJECT object-name
Explanation: Specification of the PART keyword in a DISPLAY DATABASE command is invalid.
The PART keyword is invalid if it is specified for:
v A nonpartitioned table space
v A nonpartitioned type 1 index
v A type 2 index not defined on a partitioned table space
The object object-name can be either a table space or an index space.
No action for this table space or index space is performed by the DISPLAY DATABASE command. Any other valid
table space or index space specified is processed by the command.
System action: The command is not processed for the table space or index space in question. All other valid table
spaces or index spaces specified in the command are processed.
User response: Resubmit the command for the nonpartitioned table space or index space without using the PART
keyword.
Problem determination: SYSIBM.SYSTABLESPACE indicates whether a table space is partitioned.
SYSIBM.SYSINDEXSPACE indicates whether an index space is partitioned and whether the index space is a type 1 or
a type 2 index. Type 2 nonpartitioned indexes can be displayed at the logical partition level; type 1 indexes cannot.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNT359I csect_name INVALID PARTITION NUMBER SPECIFIED - part-num FOR OBJECT object-name
Explanation: An invalid partition number was specified in the PART keyword for a DISPLAY DATABASE
command.
Partition number part-num is invalid for the object object-name.
System action: The part number is ignored. All other valid partitions specified are processed.
User response: Determine the correct partition specification for the table space or index that was the subject of the
specified command and resubmit the command.
Problem determination: SYSIBM.SYSTABLESPACE in the DB2 catalog indicates the correct range of partition
numbers for the table space. SYSIBM.SYSINDEXSPACE in the DB2 catalog indicates whether an index space is
partitioned and whether the index space is a type 1 or a type 2 index. The PART keyword can be used to display the
status of logical partitions of type 2 indexes but not type 1 indexes.
Severity: 8 (error)

OVERVIEW
The output includes all table spaces and index spaces that are contained within the databases that
are specified.
database-name
The name of the database.
database- status
The status of the database. The value can be one or more of the following strings delimited by a comma.
The maximum length of the string is 18 characters.
RO The database is started for read activity only.
RW The database is started for read and write activity.
STOP The database is stopped.
STOPP A stop operation for this database is in progress, is pending or has failed.
If the object seems to be in a persistent STOPP status, check whether the stop operation is still in
progress. You can check this progress by looking at message DSNI003I or the output from the
DISPLAY THREAD command with the TYPE(SYSTEM) option.
v Message DSNI003I lists objects that could not be stopped.
v In the DISPLAY THREAD output, look for message DSNV501I with STOP DATABASE listed as
the command that is executing. If you see one of these messages, the STOP DATABASE
command is still in progress for the thread that is identified in DSNV402I.
If the STOP operation timed out or failed, resolve the error by using the START DATABASE
command.

DSNI003I on page 215
UT The database is started for utility processing only.
UTRO A utility that allows only RO access is in process on the database. If the utility was canceled before
the object was drained, the object can allow SQL access, because the object was not altered by the
utility.
UTRW A utility that allows RW access is in process on the database.
UTUT A utility that allows only UT access is in process on the database. If the utility was canceled before
the object was drained, the object can allow SQL access, because the object was not altered by the
utility.
dbd-length
The length of the database descriptor (DBD) in bytes.
 DSNT363I - PHYSICAL ERROR PAGE RANGE FOR DATA SET data-set-name LOW=lowphy, HIGH=hiphy
This line lists any physical I/O errors on a data set. This information is displayed if such errors exist and
the SPACENAM option was specified on the DISPLAY DATABASE command.
This message refers to physical pages in a data set that supports a page set. Page sets (table spaces or index
spaces) are made up of supporting data sets. Physical pages are pages in supporting data sets. Physical pages
are numbered from the beginning of the particular data set in which they reside.
data-set-name
The name of the data set with errors.
lowphy The first page number in the range of physical pages that were being read when the I/O errors
occurred. These physical pages are within the identified data set.
hiphy The last page number in the range of physical pages that were being read when the I/O errors
occurred.
space The table space name, index space name, or table object ID (OBID).
The line that begins with space describes the status of a table space or index space in the specified database.
(The database is listed in the preceding DSNT362I line.) This line is repeated as many times as needed to
satisfy the DISPLAY DATABASE request.
The line that begins with space, the header line that precedes it, and the DISPLAY OF DATABASE line are
always produced with a multiple line WTO and are never interrupted.
type The type of object. type can have one of the following values:
TS Table space
IX Index space
LS LOB table space
TB Table
XS XML table space
If the object is involved in cloning, type is appended with a B (for a base object) or a C (for a clone object)
and a data set instance number. For example, a base object that is involved with cloning has B2 appended to
the type indicator if it is represented by an instance number 2 data set. A base object that is no longer
involved with cloning has no suffix.
Look at the CLONE column in the SYSIBM.SYSTABLESPACE catalog table to determine whether a table
space and its objects are involved in cloning. A value of Y in the CLONE column indicates that cloning is
active. The value in the INSTANCE column indicates the data set instance number for the current base
objects.
Related information:
SYSIBM.SYSTABLESPACE table (DB2 SQL)
parts The number of partitions in the table space, index space, LOB table space, or XML table space. This value is
blank for a simple table space, simple index space, or segmented table space.
part The partition number. This value is blank for a nonpartitioned table space or an index on a nonpartitioned
table space. For nonpartitioned secondary indexes, this value is the logical partition number preceded by the
character L (for example, L0001). For data-partitioned secondary indexes, this value is preceded by the
character D (for example, D0001).
If this column is blank or contains L* for a partitioned object, the data that is reported in that line of output
applies to the entire table space or index object.
status The status of the table space or index space. Possible values are blank, or one or more of the following

lock A description of the following types of locks and the duration of the locks:
v Transaction locks (also called L-locks) are identified by the connection ID and correlation ID of their
corresponding agents.
Multiple locks that are held by an agent are listed on multiple lines of the report followed by any locks on
which the agent is waiting.
v Physical locks (P-locks) and retained locks are identified by their DB2 data sharing member names.
Multiple P-locks or retained locks that are held by a DB2 data sharing member are listed on multiple lines
of the report. The output then lists any locks on which the member is waiting.
lock consists of the following information:
lock status-lock state,lock type,lock duration
lock status
The status of the lock, which can be one of the following values:
H The lock is held by the agent or the DB2 member.
W The agent or the member is waiting for the lock.
R The lock is retained.
lock state
The mode of the lock as follows:
v For L-locks and drain locks, lock state has one of the following values:
IS A lock with read intentions.
IX A lock with update intentions.
S A lock with read-only capability.
U A lock with update capability.
SIX A table space or table lock with a protocol that does not lock a page while reading it,
but does lock the page with update intention while updating it.
X An exclusive lock.
v For L-locks on LOB table spaces, lock state has one of the following values:
IS A lock with intent to reserve space within the LOB table space
IX A lock with intent to insert LOBs in the LOB table space.
S A lock that reserves space within the LOB table space.
SIX A lock that allows the owner to read and update LOBs.
X An exclusive lock.

SIX This DB2 member has R/W interest. The page set or partition is GBP-dependent.
NSU This DB2 member has R/W interest. The page set or partition is GBP-dependent.
X This DB2 member has R/W interest. The page set or partition is not GBP-dependent.
lock type
lock type describes the type of locking and has one of the following values:
S A table space L-lock
T A table L-lock
C A cursor-stability read drain lock
R A repeatable-read drain lock
W A write drain lock
P A partition L-lock
PP A page set or partition P-lock
lock duration
lock duration describes the duration of the lock as follows:
v If lock status has a value of H, lock duration has one of the following values:
A The lock is freed at deallocation.
C The lock is freed at commit.
H The lock is freed when all cursors are closed.
M The lock is freed by the system.
P The lock is freed when the plan is complete.
I The lock is a page set or partition P-lock. It is released when the page set or partition
data set is closed.
v If the lock status has a value of W, lock duration is a two-digit number that indicates the position
of the waiter in the lock waiting queue for the local DB2 system.
After the agent acquires the lock, the lock status value becomes H, and the lock duration value
becomes one of the lock duration values that are listed for a lock status of H.
v For a P-lock, the lock is owned by the system, not the user, and its duration is not related to the
duration of the locks that are owned by the user.
v Retained locks do not have a lock duration.
No explicit index space locks exist. However, all index spaces on tables are implicitly locked with
transaction locks at the same level as the table spaces that contain those tables. P-locks are acquired by DB2
on index spaces and on table spaces.
LPL-pages
The pages in the specified space that are unavailable because of logical or physical damage.
pages-2 More pages that are in the logical page list (LPL) for the listed object. pages-2 is displayed if the list of pages
cannot fit on the preceding line.
LPL pages can be listed in one of the following two formats:
v Single pages, which are represented by the page number
v A range of pages, which are represented by the starting page number followed by a dash and the ending
page number in the range
lo-page A hexadecimal number that identifies the lowest page number that contains a physical I/O error.

DSNT375I PLAN=plan-name1 WITH CORRELATION-ID=correlation-id1 CONNECTION-ID=connection-id1 LUW-ID=luw-id1 THREAD-INFO=thread-information1 IS DEADLOCKED WITH PLAN=plan-name2 WITH CORRELATION-ID=correlation-id2 CONNECTION-ID=connection-id2 LUW-ID=luw-id2 THREAD-INFO= thread-information2 ON MEMBER member-name
Explanation: A plan has been denied an IRLM lock because of a detected deadlock.
plan-name1 and plan-name2
The names of the executing plans.
plan-name1
The plan that was denied an IRLM lock.
plan-name2
One of the members of the deadlock.
DB2 does not attempt to identify all survivors of a deadlock or all participants in a deadlock in this
message. This plan might be only one of several plans that are holding locks on the resource.
If multiple deadlocks are detected during the same deadlock-detection interval, the lock holder
identified by plan-name2 in one instance of this message might be selected to break a deadlock
identified by a different instance of this message. The lock holder identified by plan-name2 is not
guaranteed to be a winner in all deadlocks in which it participates.
If you receive a system plan in this message for either plan-name1 or plan-name2, see the information about
system plans in message DSNT376I.
correlation-id1 and correlation-id2
The correlation identifiers of the threads that are associated with, respectively, plan-name1 and plan-name2.
Correlation IDs that begin with values between 001 and 028 identify system agents.
connection-id1 and connection-id2
The connection identifiers of, respectively, plan-name1 and plan-name2.
luw-id1 and luw-id2
The logical unit of work identifiers (LUWIDs) of, respectively, plan-name1 and plan-name2.
* The thread does not have a LUWID.
luw-id=token
The logical unit of work ID and a five-digit token value. The token value can be used in any DB2
command that accepts a LUWID as input.
thread-information1 and thread-information2
Information about the thread. The information is presented in a colon-delimited list that contains the
following segments:
v The primary authorization ID that is associated with the thread.
v The name of the user's workstation.
v The ID of the user.
v The name of the application.
v The statement type for the previously executed statement: dynamic or static.
v The statement identifier for the previously executed statement, if available. The statement identifier can be
used to identify the particular SQL statement. For static statements, the statement identifier correlates to
the STMT_ID column in the SYSIBM.SYSPACKSTMT table. For dynamic statements, the statement
identifier correlates to the STMT_ID column in the DSN_STATEMENT_CACHE_TABLE table. That
statement might not have contributed to the current failure.
v The name of the role that is associated with the thread.
v The correlation token that can be used to correlate work at the remote system with work performed at the
DB2 subsystem. The correlation token, if available, is enclosed in '<' and '>' characters, and contains three
components, separated by periods:
C A 3 to 39 character IP address.
C A 1 to 8 character port address.
C A 12 character unique identifier.
An asterisk (*) in any segment indicates that the information is not available.
member-name
The name of the member of the DB2 subsystem on which the thread associated with plan-id2 is executing.
System action: The SQLCA that corresponds to the correlation ID, connection ID, and LUWID for plan-name1
contains the name of the resource that is involved in the deadlock and one of the following SQL codes: -904, -911 ,
-913, or -923.
DB2 can recover from a lock denial in some cases and can complete successfully. In such a case, the SQLCA is not
filled in. One example is during setup of performance enhancements during bind time for execution time.
Problem determination: A DB2 IFCID 172 trace record contains the information needed to determine all participants
in, and survivors of, a given deadlock.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v IRLM trace output.

DSNT411I SQLCAID = xxxx, SQLCA IDENTIFIER
Explanation: The SQLCA ID field (SQLCAID) is not the expected value, C'SQLCA'.
System programmer response: The SQLCA area is invalid. This type of error is usually the result of one of the
following:
v Calling the DSNTIAR formatting routine before an SQL statement initializes the area
v Overlaying the SQLCA area
v Passing the wrong address to the DSNTIAR routine.
Correct the error, and rerun the application program.
DSNT412I SQLCABC = xxxx, SQLCA BYTE COUNT
Explanation: The size of the SQLCA is not the expected value (136 bytes).
System programmer response: The SQLCA area is invalid. Correct the error. It is probably an overlay or an
incorrect SQLCA address. Rerun the application program.
DSNT413I SQLCODE = xxxx, INVALID SQLCODE
Explanation: The SQL return code is not a valid value.
System programmer response: Either the SQLCA area is invalid or the maintenance was not coordinated correctly.
As a result, the SQL return code was added to the DB2 subsystem but not to the formatting routine.
An invalid SQLCA area is usually the result of one of the following:
v Calling the DSNTIAR formatting routine before an SQL statement initializes the area
v Overlaying the SQLCA area
v Passing the wrong address to the DSNTIAR routine.
If the maintenance was not coordinated correctly, the DSNTIAR and DSNTIAM CSECTs were probably not replaced
in the code that is now running. Link-edit the load module, and replace DSNTIAR and DSNTIAM. Correct the error,
and rerun the application program.
DSNT414I SQLERRM = xxxx, SQLCA ERROR MESSAGE INSERTION TEXT
Explanation: This message results from an SQL return code that is not recognized by DSNTIAR. SQLERRM contains
error message text.
System programmer response: Either the SQLCA area is invalid or the maintenance was not coordinated correctly.
As a result, the SQL return code was added to the DB2 subsystem but not to the formatting routine.
An invalid SQLCA area is usually the result of one of the following:
v Calling the DSNTIAR formatting routine before an SQL statement initializes the area
v Overlaying the SQLCA area
v Passing the wrong address to the DSNTIAR routine.
If the maintenance was not coordinated correctly, the DSNTIAR and DSNTIAM CSECTs were probably not replaced
in the code that is now running. Link-edit the load module, and replace DSNTIAR and DSNTIAM. Correct the error,
and rerun the application program.
DSNT415I SQLERRP = xxxx, SQL PROCEDURE DETECTING ERROR

DSNT438I WARNING, IRLM LOCK MAXIMUM SPACE = specified-max MB, AVAILABLE SPACE = available-space MB
Explanation: The maximum number of locks allowed for each user could exceed what is available to the IRLM.
specified-max
The estimated maximum amount of space specified as IRLM LOCK MAXIMUM SPACE on panel DSNTIPC.
available-space
The amount of space that is available for IRLM locks. The available space is specified in the MAX STORAGE
FOR LOCKS field of the DSNTIPJ installation panel, and is never less than 2 GB.
All threads are not likely to have the maximum number of locks. However, if the specified-max value exceeds the
amount of available space by a significant factor, the possibility of abends in the IRLM increases.
System action: The CLIST continues.
User response: Choose one of the following responses:
v Ensure that you can run with the overcommitment of lock address space.
v Reduce the values of the MAX USERS, MAX REMOTE ACTIVE, or LOCKS PER USER fields.
v Increase the value of the MAX STORAGE FOR LOCKS field.

DSNT439I IRLM NO LOCK ESCALATION OR NO USER MAXIMUM
Explanation: You specified the number 0 for:
v The number of table or table space locks that will cause lock escalation, or
v The number of locks that will terminate a DB2 user.
A lock escalation value of 0 turns off lock escalation and means that DB2 cannot use this means of conserving lock
space. A user maximum of 0 means that the calculation noted in the DSNT438 message cannot be performed to see if
the IRLM has sufficient address space for all users, since there is no maximum per user.
This message is issued by the following installation CLIST: DSNTINST
System action: The CLIST will continue. This is only a warning.
User response: Turn off lock escalation and/or user lock limiting.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNT440I TOTAL BP SIZE TOO LARGE
Explanation: The total size of a buffer pool is too large. The summation of the ssnmDBM1 address space storage
requirements for all buffer pools cannot exceed 1TB. When calculating the storage requirements for the buffer pools,
DB2 uses the page size (4K, 8K, 16K, or 32K) for each buffer.
System action: The panel is redisplayed and the cursor is placed on the field in error.
User response: Reduce one or more of the buffer pool sizes.
DSNT442E ERROR, VIRTUAL STORAGE OF main EXCEEDS THE SYSTEM LIMIT OF 2 GIGABYTES

Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNT454I ERROR CODE = errcode, CNT = count
Explanation: An error was encountered during CLIST processing for reading the parameter member. Most of these
errors are caused by having a mismatch between the level of the CLIST and that of the parameter member being
read.
The 'errcode' is an error code defined for the CLIST. The error code values and associated meanings are found in
TSO/E CLISTS.
The 'count' value is the number of parameter values already read.
This message is issued by the following installation CLIST: DSNTINST
System action: The CLIST will terminate.
User response: Be sure the parameter member and the CLIST are at the same level.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in the process, set CONTROL(CONLIST) and invoke the CLIST in
batch, so that the tracing can be sent with the error documentation. You will also need the listing of the CLIST and
the parameter member being read.
DSNT456I ERROR IN VARIABLE varname, VALUE IS value
Explanation: The variable named 'varname' does not have a valid value. Its current value is 'value'. Subsequent
messages will describe the reason the value is invalid and the action taken by the CLIST.
If the error is in the CONTROL value, the value was specified when the CLIST was invoked. The value is not valid,
and no additional tracing will be done. The permitted values are NONE, LIST, CONLIST, and SYMLIST. Each value
produces more CLIST tracing information than those which precede it. If the error is in other values, the value was
specified when the CLIST was invoked on the ISPF panels.
This message is issued by the following installation CLIST: DSNTINST
System action: The CLIST will continue, but will not produce jobs or parameter data.
User response: Check the subsequent messages. Exit, then invoke the CLIST with a valid value for the variable.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in the process, set CONTROL(CONLIST) and invoke the CLIST in
batch, so that the tracing can be sent with the error documentation. The CLIST itself and the parameter member read
in should be sent as well.
Severity: 8 (error)

DSNT481I DSNTINST data set DATA SET SIZE MAY BE TOO SMALL
Explanation: The DSNTINST CLIST encountered an arithmetic overflow during calculation of this data set's size.
System action: DSNTINST continues processing and uses 2147483647 for the result of the calculation that caused the
overflow. Thus, the size of the data set might be too small.
User response: Check the data set size in installation job DSNTIJIN. If it is too small, increase it.
DSNT482I TOO MANY CONCURRENTLY ALLOCATED DATA SETS, opnds
Explanation: The number (opnds) calculated for the number of concurrent databases, tables per database, and table
spaces per database, is too large. The maximum number of data sets that are allowed is 100,000. See DSNT436I and DSNT437I for more information.
The number of concurrently allocated data sets is calculated using the formula:
OPNDS = (NUMCONDB X NUMTABLE X NUMINDEX) +
(NUMCONDB X NUMTABSP)
Where Represents
NUMCONDB
The maximum number of concurrently active databases (DATABASES on panel DSNTIPE)
NUMTABLE
The estimated average number of tables per database (TABLES on panel DSNTIPD)
NUMINDEX
The estimated average number of indexes per table (set to 2)
NUMTABSP
The estimated average number of table spaces per database (TABLE SPACES on panel DSNTIPD)
This message is issued by the following installation CLIST: DSNTINST

DSNT500I csect-name RESOURCE UNAVAILABLE REASON reason-code TYPE resource-type NAME resource-name
Explanation: The requested function requires a resource that is currently unavailable.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
reason-code
A numeric value that indicates the reason for the failure.
resource-type
The type, format, and content of the resource that is identified by resource-name.
resource-name
The name of the resource that is currently unavailable.
System action: Additional messages and codes are issued to identify the system action and the action that should be
taken by the installation or operator.
Operator response: Use the reason-code, resource-type, and resource-name values provided in the message to identify
the source of the problem.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
If resource-type is X'D00' or X'D01', use the following SQL statement to determine the table name:
SELECT CREATOR, NAME
FROM SYSIBM.SYSTABLES
WHERE DBID = dbid AND OBID = obid;
This statement can either fail or return an incorrect name if the table has been dropped.

DSNT501I csect-name RESOURCE UNAVAILABLE CORRELATION-ID = correlation-id CONNECTION-ID = connection-id LUW-ID = luw-id REASON = reason-code TYPE = resource-type NAME = resource-name
Explanation: The requested function requires a resource that is unavailable. This message is issued with other
messages that identify the system action and the action that the installer or operator should take.
In some cases, DB2 can recover from this situation where a resource is not available and can complete successfully.
One example is during the setup of a performance enhancement during bind time for execution time. If DB2 recovers
successfully, no action is necessary.
correlation-id
The correlation identifier of the thread that is associated with the requester of the resource.
connection-id
The connection identifier of the requester.
luw-id The logical-unit-of-work identifier (LUW-ID) of the thread that is associated with the requester of the
resource. An asterisk (*) indicates that the thread does not have a LUW-ID. If the LUW-ID is not an asterisk,
the value is a logical-unit-of-work-id that is assigned to the thread. This value is followed by an equal sign
(=) and a token value, which can be used in place of logical-unit-of-work-id in any DB2 command that
accepts logical-unit-of-work-id as input.
reason-code
The reason code that tells why the resource is unavailable.
resource-type
The type of resource that is unavailable. resource-type identifies the type, format, and content of resource-name.
To find the type of resource that is identified in the message, see Appendix C, Resource types, on page
1131.
resource-name
The name of the resource that is unavailable.
For some situations, message DSNT501I is issued once and then suppressed until the resource is available. For
example, this situation occurs when this message is issued for reason code 00C90081. As another example, for
TYPE=905, REASON=00C90092, and NAME=IRLM, message DSNT501I is usually issued once. It is suppressed at the
DB2 subsystem level until the IRLM out-of-storage condition is relieved.
Operator response: Note the values for reason-code, resource-type, and resource-name.
System programmer response: Look up the reason code for more information about why the resource was
unavailable and possible actions to correct the problem. For example, if the reason code is 00C900A6, you must
migrate the catalog to the current release. To do so, run DSNTIJTC.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.

with a semicolon.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
DSNT503I UNLOAD DATA SET ddname RECORD LENGTH SET TO nnnnn.
Explanation: If the ddname is SYSRECnn, the record length specified in the JCL for the data set is not large enough
to contain an entire row of unloaded data, or the record length was not specified in the JCL.
If the ddname is SYSPUNCH, the record length specified in the JCL is not between 80 and 255, or the record length
was not specified in the JCL.
System action: DB2 sets the record length of the unload data set to the value specified in the message text.
DSNT504I UNLOAD DATA SET ddname BLOCKSIZE SET TO nnnnn.
Explanation: The block size for the SYSRECnn or SYSPUNCH data set was one of the following:
v Not specified in the JCL
v Set to zero in the JCL
v Less than the required record length
v Not an even multiple of the required record length
System action: DB2 sets the block size of the unload data set to the value specified in the message text.
DSNT505I DSNTIAUL OPTIONS USED: 'nnn'.
Explanation: You specified these options when you invoked DSNTIAUL. 'SQL' is the only valid option.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNT506I INPUT STATEMENT WAS NOT A FULL SELECT ON A SINGLE TABLE. LOAD STATEMENT WILL NEED MODIFICATION.
Explanation: The SELECT statement used to request a table unload contained one of the following:
v A SELECT clause other than "SELECT * FROM"
v A FROM clause that does not contain exactly one table name
The table to be loaded is therefore not the same as the table from which the data is unloaded. DSNTIAUL is unable
to determine the table name and all column names for the table to be loaded.
System action: DSNTIAUL generates a LOAD statement containing the string 'TBLNAME' for the table name. Some
column names may be blank.
User response: Change the LOAD statement table name to the name of a table with the indicated column
descriptions.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNT507I csect-name RECORD LENGTH NEEDED IS GREATER THAN MAXIMUM ALLOWED FOR TABLE table-name
Explanation: In order to unload table table-name, DB2 needs an output data set with a record length greater than the
system maximum of 32760 bytes. This occurs when the table to be unloaded is in a 32KB page table space and
contains a combination of long columns and a number of date, time, or timestamp columns.
System action: The application program is terminated.

PORT. Or, remove all of the values from all of the port fields.
DSNT526I WARNING: DSNHDECP SPECIFIES AN UNDEFINED (0) VALUE FOR ccsid-parm NOTIFY THE SYSTEM PROGRAMMER.
Explanation: The DSNHDECP module or user-supplied applications default module that is used by the DB2
precompiler contains an undefined (0) value for the CCSID parameter that is indicated by ccsid-parm. The use of
CCSIDs that are undefined will be disallowed by DB2 in the near future.
System action: Processing continues.
System programmer response: The dsnhdecp module must specify a valid, non-zero default CCSID (coded character
set identifier) for each of the three encoding schemes that are supported: ASCII, EBCDIC, and UNICODE. Processing
character data with an undefined CCSID can lead to unpredictable results, including loss or corruption of the data. A
default CCSID must be defined even for encoding schemes not used on your DB2 system.
If ccsid-parm is ASCCSID, then the default CCSID for single-byte ASCII-encoded character data is undefined (set to 0).
If ccsid-parm is SCCSID, then the default CCSID for single-byte EBCDIC-encoded character data is undefined (set to
0).
You need to take steps now to select an appropriate CCSID for each undefined CCSID, and to plan for and schedule
deployment of the updated dsnhdecp modules on your DB2 subsystem or data sharing system.
Do not attempt to choose or change a CCSID without guidance from IBM. Using the wrong CCSID can corrupt your
data and render it unrecoverable.
User response: Notify the System Programmer.
DSNT527I ERROR: DB2 ATTEMPTED TO START USING THE DB2-SUPPLIED DSNHDECP MODULE.  NOTIFY THE SYSTEM PROGRAMMER.
Explanation: The DSNHDECP module that is supplied by DB2 is being used to run the DB2 precompiler. DB2
requires site-dependent settings that are specified in the DSNHDECP module that was created when DB2 was
installed. The DSNHDECP that was generated during installation typically is located in the SDSNEXIT library.
System action: DB2 startup is discontinued.
System programmer response: Check the STEPLIB, JOBLIB, or system link list concatenation used in the DB2
address spaces. To ensure that the proper DSNHDECP module is used, verify that the library that contains the
DSNHDECP module that is generated during installation precedes the SDSNLOAD library that contains the
DSNHDECP module that was supplied by DB2.
User response: Notify the System Programmer.
DSNT528I USE PROTECTION MUST BE YES WHEN CACHE DYNAMIC SQL IS YES

panel DSNTIP8 and enter NO for CACHE DYNAMIC SQL. If you see this message on panel DSNTIP8, enter a value
of NO for CACHE DYNAMIC SQL, or go to panel DSNTIPP and enter YES for USE PROTECTION.
DSNT530I program-name COULD NOT RUN BECAUSE IT WAS NOT INVOKED FROM AN APF-AUTHORIZED LIBRARY
Explanation: program-name could not run for one of the following reasons:
v program-name was not invoked from an APF-authorized library.
v One or more libraries in the STEPLIB or JOBLIB concatenation the job that invokes program-name is not
APF-authorized.
System action: The program terminates.
System programmer response: Ensure that program-name is link-edited with option AC(1) and resides in an
APF-authorized library. Ensure that all libraries in the STEPLIB and JOBLIB concatenation for the job that invokes
program-name are APF authorized. If program-name is an external module for a DB2 stored procedure or user-defined
function, ensure that the corresponding SYSIBM.SYSROUTINES entry specifies a WLM-established address space.
User response: Notify the system programmer.

DSNT540I wlm-environment-name WAS REFRESHED BY user USING AUTHORITY FROM SQL ID sqlid
Explanation: DB2 stored procedure WLM_REFRESH refreshed WLM environment wlm-environment-name. User ID
user issued the request, using authority from SQL ID sqlid.
System action: WLM environment wlm-environment-name is refreshed.
System programmer response: None
User response: None
DSNT541I WLM REFRESH REQUEST FAILED. RESOURCE PROFILE subsystem-name.WLM_REFRESH.wlmenvironment- name IS UNDEFINED
Explanation: DB2 stored procedure WLM_REFRESH rejected a request to refresh WLM environment
wlm-environment-name because SAF resource profile subsystem-name.WLM_REFRESH.wlm-environment-name does not
exist. WLM_REFRESH uses the resource profile to verify whether the requestor is authorized to refresh the WLM
environment. The requestor was connected to DB2 subsystem subsystem-name.
System action: WLM_REFRESH rejects the refresh request.
System programmer response: Create the SAF resource profile in resource class DSNR, and permit READ access to
all primary and secondary authorization IDs that need to refresh the WLM environment.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
DSNT542I SQL ID sqlid IS NOT AUTHORIZED TO REFRESH WLM ENVIRONMENT wlm-environment-name
Explanation: DB2 stored procedure WLM_REFRESH rejected a request to refresh WLM environment
wlm-environment-name because sqlid is not authorized. sqlid is the current SQLID of the requestor.
System action: WLM_REFRESH rejects the refresh request.
System programmer response: Give sqlid READ access or higher on the appropriate SAF resource profile. That
profile resides in SAF resource class DSNR and has the format ssid.WLM_REFRESH.wlm-environment-name.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
DSNT543I WLM REFRESH REQUEST FAILED: PARAMETER parameter IS NULL, BLANK, OR CONTAINS INVALID CHARACTERS
Explanation: The argument passed to WLM_REFRESH for parameter cannot be used for one of the following
reasons:
v It is null or blank
v It contains characters that are not allowed for a SAF resource profile or for a DB2 subsystem name
System action: The program terminates.
System programmer response:
v For the WLM_ENV_NAME parameter, specify a non-null, non-blank argument. That argument must conform to
the rules for a SAF resource profile.
v For the SSID parameter, specify a null or blank argument, or a value that conforms to the rules for a DB2
subsystem name. If you specify a null or blank value, DB2 determines the subsystem name.
User response: Notify the system programmer.

DSNT544I SQLID sqlid IS UNDEFINED OR user IS NOT PERMITTED TO USE IT TO REFRESH wlm-environment-name
Explanation: DB2 stored procedure WLM_REFRESH rejected a request by user id user to refresh WLM environment
wlm-environment-name using authorization id sqlid. The request was denied either because sqlid does not exist or
because user is not permitted to use it.
System action: WLM_REFRESH rejects the refresh request.
System programmer response: If sqlid exists, permit user to use it. Otherwise, create sqlid, give it READ access or
higher on the appropriate SAF resource profile (which resides in SAF resource class DSNR and has the format
ssid.WLM_REFRESH.wlm-environment-name), and permit user to use it.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
DSNT545I WLM REFRESH REQUEST FAILED BECAUSE OF AN UNEXPECTED SYSTEM MESSAGE WITH IDENTIFIER message-identifier
Explanation: The system has denied a WLM refresh request passed by DB2 stored procedure WLM_REFRESH.
message-identifier is the identifier of a system message that was issued when the request failed.
System action: The refresh request is denied.
System programmer response: Examine the system log in the vicinity of the failed refresh request and locate
message identifier message-identifier. Use this message and related messages to diagnose and correct the problem that
is preventing the WLM refresh request.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
DSNT546I WLM REFRESH REQUEST CANCELLED BECAUSE AN EXTENDED MCS CONSOLE COULD NOT BE ACTIVATED WITHIN n SECONDS
Explanation: DB2 stored procedure WLM_REFRESH rejected a request because it was unable to activate an
extended MCS console within the allowed period of n seconds. The extended MCS console serializes the
WLM_REFRESH requests and verifies that z/OS completed the refresh request.
System action: WLM_REFRESH rejects the refresh request.
System programmer response: This message indicates that WLM_REFRESH is busy processing one or more
previous requests. Issue the DB2 command -DIS PROC(SYSPROC.WLM_REFRESH) and examine the ACTIVE, QUEUED,
and MAXQUE values to analyze whether or not a large backlog of calls to WLM_REFRESH currently exists. To give
WLM_REFRESH more time to respond to these requests, you can increase the wait time by updating the setting of
the WAITLMT constant in the source code of the external module for WLM_REFRESH, DSNTWR. You need to
prepare and bind DSNTWR again for the change to take effect.
User response: If you receive DSNT456I from subsequent calls to WLM_REFRESH, notify the system programmer.
DSNT547I THE RESULT OF THE WLM REFRESH REQUEST IS UNKNOWN BECAUSE THE SYSTEM DID NOT REPLY WITHIN n SECONDS
Explanation: The DB2-supplied stored procedure, WLM_REFRESH, accepted and validated the request to refresh a
WLM environment and passed it to z/OS for processing. However, z/OS did not respond within the wait period of
n seconds.
System action: WLM_REFRESH terminates with return code 4.
System programmer response: This message indicates that your system is suppressing one or more of the messages
that can be generated in response to the VARY WLM command. DSNTWR, the external module for WLM_REFRESH,
uses an extended MCS console (also named DSNTWR) to monitor whether or not the VARY WLM command
succeeded or failed. Messages with the IDs IWM032I (refresh complete) and IWM031I (refresh in progress) indicate
that the refresh request processed successfully. So, for WLM_REFRESH to function correctly, you need to ensure that
the system does not suppress messages IWM031I and IWM032I.
This error can also occur if the specified WLM environment requires more than n seconds to refresh. In this case, you
need to increase the wait time allowed for the reply by updating the setting of the WAITLMT constant in the source
code of the external module for WLM_REFRESH, DSNTWR. You need to prepare and bind DSNTWR again for the
change to take effect.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
DSNT548I calling-program-name LOAD MODULE NAME called-module-name NOT FOUND, BLDL R15=return-code, R0=reason-code

v IT CANNOT BE ALLOCATED OR OPENED FOR OUTPUT
An error occurred during an allocate, open, or close operation on data-set-name.
v ERROR PROCESSING REQUESTED DATA SET
The request for data-set-name could not be processed.
v MEMBER SPECIFIED, BUT DATASET IS NOT PARTITIONED
data-set-name already exists, but is not a partitioned data set as required by the CLIST.
v PROTECTED DATASET
Your userid is not authorized to use data-set-name.
v VOLUME NOT ON SYSTEM
data-set-name is registered in the system catalog on a DASD or tape volume which is currently unmounted or
unavailable.
v UNAVAILABLE DATASET
data-set-name is currently allocated by another user.
System action: The Install panel for specifying data-set-name is redisplayed. You cannot proceed to the next DB2
Install panel until the problem is resolved.
User response: Take one of the following actions according to reason:
v For errors allocating, opening, or processing data-set-name, specific diagnostic messages are displayed by TSO. If
you are not seeing these messages, enter the command TSO PROFILE WTPMSG in the command line of the
current DB2 install panel. Consult the appropriate MVS system messages and codes manual for further information
about these messages.
v If data-set-name is indicated as a non-partitioned data set, verify that you have entered the intended data set name
for CLIST output. If so, rename or delete the existing data set.
v Consult your system security administrator to obtain access to a protected data set.
v In the event of an unavailable data set, ask the current user(s) to release it. Ask your system programmer to
identify the user(s) if you are unable to do so. Otherwise, try later when the data set has been freed.

The dump of the SQLCA is shown here on multiple lines because of space limitations. The empty lines here indicate
the correct line breaks.
Explanation: The application program called the GET DIAGNOSTICS service to format one or more of the warning
or error conditions that occurred during the processing of the current SQL statement that was input into the system.
However, the GET DIAGNOSTICS service also returned warnings or errors, as indicated by the SQLCA dump. The
application therefore will use the DSNTIAR message formatting service instead of GET DIAGNOSTICS. Attention:
Messages formatted by DSNTIAR might contain truncated tokens. Also, when multiple unexpected SQLCODEs were
returned for the current inputted SQL statement, DSNTIAR reports on the first one.
System action: The application program continues.
System programmer response: See the problem determination section of this message.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Use the SQLCA dump provided by DSNT570I to determine the cause of the problem. After
the problem is resolved, run the application again.

Explanation: This message is the normal response for a START RLIMIT command. Table 'table-name' is currently
being used to determine resource limits.
System action: The governor has started utilizing the specified table.
System programmer response: May be used to resolve questions about what table is being used.
DSNT705I csect-name DATABASE name CANNOT BE STOPPED. IT CONTAINS AN ACTIVE RESOURCE LIMIT SPECIFICATION TABLE
Explanation: Database name cannot be stopped because it contains an active resource limit specification table.
System action: The database is not stopped.
Operator response: If the database must be stopped, either stop the resource limit facility (STOP RLIMIT), or switch
it to use a resource limit specification table that is not in the database (START RLIMIT,ID=xx). In a DB2 data sharing
environment, you must either stop the resource limit facility on all members of the DB2 data sharing group or switch
it to use a resource limit specification table that is not in the database.
DSNT706I TABLE table-name DOES NOT EXIST. THE START RLIMIT COMMAND WILL NOT USE THIS TABLE
Explanation: The START RLIMIT command has been entered but was unable to use the table because it does not
exist.
table-name
The name of the table.
System action: RLF cannot use this table for governing.
Operator response: Verify that the 1 or 2 characters following DSNRLST or DSNRLMT in the table name are the
same characters that were entered as the ID on the START RLIMIT command. If the ID appears correct, contact the
system programmer.
System programmer response: A table with the fully-qualified name qualifier.table-name does not exist. The qualifier
is the value of the RLFAUTH subsystem parameter. To determine the names of the of the existing resource limit
specification tables, issue SQL statements like the following examples:
SELECT CREATOR,NAME FROM SYSIBM.SYSTABLES
WHERE NAME LIKE DSNRLST
SELECT CREATOR,NAME FROM SYSIBM.SYSTABLES
WHERE NAME LIKE DSNRLMT
If the query returns a row that matches qualifier.table-name, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.

A profile exception threshold was exceeded.
WARNING
A profile warning threshold was exceeded.
number The number of times that any monitor profile warning or exception condition has occurred since the most
recent DSNT771I message was issued, or since the START PROFILE command was issued.
System action: This message is issued at a minimum interval of five minutes.
In addition to issuing this message, the system writes a statistics class 4 IFCID 402 trace record for any profile
warning or exception condition that occurs in a statistics interval. The statistics trace record provides counters that
track the number of times a given profile threshold in a specific PROFILE ID was exceeded. See IFCID 402 for more
information.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response:
1. Determine the destination of statistics class 4 and locate and analyze the trace record.
2. If possible, use the statistics trace record to identify which profile threshold in a given profile ID detected the
warning or exception condition.
3. Determine if the profile threshold is sufficient. If the profile threshold is set too low, increase the profile threshold
value in the DSN_PROFILE_ATTRIBUTES table, then refresh the threshold by issuing START PROFILE command.
4. Optional: Stop the profile monitoring processing by performing either of the following tasks:
Disable monitoring for the profile
To disable the monitoring function for a specific profile:
a. Locate the appropriate row in SYSIBM.DSN_PROFILE_TABLE and either delete the row or change
the PROFILE_ENABLED column value to N.
b. Use the START PROFILE command to reload the profile table
Disable all monitoring
To disable all monitoring for both system related and statement related monitoring events that have been
specified in the profile table, issue the STOP PROFILE command.

Explanation: A monitor profile has detected that an idle thread timeout warning condition occurred.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
luwid=token
The logical unit of work identifier (LUWID) and a six-digit token value. The token value can be used in any
DB2 command that accepts an LUWID as input.
thread-information
Information about the thread. The information is presented in a colon-delimited list that contains the
following segments:
v The primary authorization ID that is associated with the thread.
v The name of the user's workstation.
v The ID of the user.
v The name of the application.
v The statement type for the previously executed statement: dynamic or static.
v The statement identifier for the previously executed statement, if available. The statement identifier can be
used to identify the particular SQL statement. For static statements, the statement identifier correlates to
the STMT_ID column in the SYSIBM.SYSPACKSTMT table. For dynamic statements, the statement
identifier correlates to the STMT_ID column in the DSN_STATEMENT_CACHE_TABLE table. That
statement might not have contributed to the current failure.
v The name of the role that is associated with the thread.
v The correlation token that can be used to correlate work at the remote system with work performed at the
DB2 subsystem. The correlation token, if available, is enclosed in '<' and '>' characters, and contains three
components, separated by periods:

DSNT800I csect-name DB2 CANNOT IDENTIFY TO IRLM. IRLM CANNOT CONNECT TO ITS DATA SHARING GROUP. THE LOCK STRUCTURE THAT IRLM ATTEMPTED TO ACCESS WAS strname.
Explanation: IRLM failed to connect to the IRLM data sharing group. This message accompanies abend reason code
00E30806.
System action: DB2 terminates abnormally with reason code 00E30806.
System programmer response: Some possible reasons why IRLM could not connect to its data sharing group are:
v The lock structure is not properly defined in the active MVS CFRM administrative policy. The lock structure name
is a concatenation of the DB2 data sharing group name and the string 'LOCK1' separated by an underscore (_). For
example, if the DB2 data sharing group name is DSNCAT, DSNCAT_LOCK1 is the lock structure name.
Ensure that the lock structure is properly defined in the active CFRM policy. The name of the lock structure that
IRLM attempted to access is given in this message. IRLM issues message DXR138E to indicate that the lock
structure definition could not be accessed in the active CFRM policy.
v IRLM could not connect the lock structure. The reason for the connect failure is given in IRLM message DXR135E.
v IRLM could not join its data sharing group. The reason for the join failure is given in IRLM message DXR134E.
v IRLM joined the wrong group. The set of IRLMs that are connected to a given lock structure must all be members
of the same group. Ensure that the GROUP parameter is correctly specified in the IRLM startup procedure. If you
give an incorrect group name, IRLM connects the lock structure, and then times out waiting for responses from
other connectors. IRLM issues message DXR133I for the timeout.
DSNT801I ACTION A (ADD) DOES NOT ALLOW GENERIC DISPLAY (% IN DATA FIELD).
Explanation: You have to specify a specific data item in the DATA field.
This message is issued by the following panel: DSN8SSH
System action: The panel is redisplayed, and the cursor is placed on the field in error.
User response: Enter specific data in the DATA field.
DSNT802I ONLY ACTION D (DISPLAY) IS ALLOWED FOR DEPARTMENT STRUCTURE.
Explanation: You cannot add, update, or erase a department structure. You can only display it.
This message is issued by the following panel: DSN8SSH
System action: The panel is redisplayed, and the cursor is placed on the field in error.
User response: Change the ACTION field to D, or change the OBJECT field to DE or EM.
DSNT803I csect-name DB2 CANNOT IDENTIFY TO IRLM. THE REQUESTED FUNCTION LEVEL IS NOT SUPPORTED.
Explanation: An attempt was made to identify to an IRLM that does not support the level of function DB2 needs.
This message accompanies abend reason code 00E30800.
System action: DB2 terminates abnormally with reason code 00E30800.
System programmer response: Ensure that the STEPLIB statement in your IRLM startup procedure is referencing
the correct IRLM code library and that IRLM is at the appropriate level of maintenance.
DSNT804I csect-name THERE ARE MODIFY LOCKS OWNED BY THIS DB2 THAT HAVE BEEN RETAINED
Explanation: When DB2 disconnected from IRLM during DB2 shutdown, IRLM indicated that there were still
outstanding modify locks. These locks were retained by IRLM. The retained locks continue to protect the resources
on which they are held from requests from other DB2s in the data sharing group. That is, IRLM rejects any lock
request from another DB2 that is incompatible with the retained state of the lock. The locks are retained until the
terminating DB2 subsystem is restarted and the resources on which the locks are held are recovered.
System action: DB2 continues with its shutdown processing.
System programmer response: No response is necessary.
DSNT807I csect-name IRLM PURGE OF RETAINED LOCKS FAILED. RETURN CODE = retcode SUB-CODE = subcode
Explanation: DB2 issued a PURGE request to IRLM to purge retained locks for this DB2. The PURGE request did
not complete successfully. This message shows the return code and subcode from IRLM.
System action: DB2 abends with reason code 00E30808. Restart processing is terminated.
System programmer response: Refer to the IRLM codes.
DSNT809E csect-name FEEDBACK FROM IRLM IDENTIFY INDICATED IRLM DID NOT CONNECT TO THE LOCK STRUCTURE
Explanation: DB2 identified to IRLM, but cannot continue because IRLM did not connect to the lock structure.
Global locking is ignored. This message accompanies abend reason code 00E30809.
System action: DB2 abnormally terminates with reason code 00E30809.
System programmer response: This condition happens if you are running DB2 in data sharing mode, but the
associated IRLM is running with local scope (SCOPE=LOCAL in the IRLM startup procedure). If you are running
DB2 in data sharing mode, ensure that the associated IRLM startup procedure specifies SCOPE=GLOBAL.
Conversely, if you are not running DB2 in data sharing mode, ensure that the associated IRLM startup procedure
specifies SCOPE=LOCAL.
DSNT810E csect-name DB2 CANNOT IDENTIFY TO IRLM. AN INVALID LOCK STRUCTURE NAME WAS DETECTED.
Explanation: DB2 could not identify to IRLM because of an invalid lock structure name. This message accompanies
abend reason code 00E30807.
System action: DB2 startup terminates abnormally with reason code 00E30807.
System programmer response: This condition happens if you are not running DB2 in data sharing mode, but the
associated IRLM is running with global scope (SCOPE=GLOBAL in the IRLM startup procedure). If you are not
running DB2 in data sharing mode, ensure that the associated IRLM startup procedure specifies SCOPE=LOCAL.
Conversely, if you are running DB2 in data sharing mode, ensure that the associated IRLM startup procedure
specifies SCOPE=GLOBAL.
DSNT811E csect-name DB2 CANNOT IDENTIFY TO IRLM. REQUEST VIOLATES ONE DB2 PER IRLM RULE.
Explanation: DB2 could not identify to IRLM because another DBMS is already identified to the IRLM. This
message accompanies abend reason code 00E30802.
System action: DB2 abends with reason code 00E30802.
System programmer response: IRLM Version 2.1 enforces a one to one (1:1) mapping between IRLM and DB2.
Multiple DBMS subsystems can no longer use the same IRLM. Ensure that:
v Each DB2 subsystem is associated with its own IRLM subsystem.
v The correct IRLM procedure name and subsystem name are specified in the DB2 system parameters.
DSNT814I NON-LOCAL INFORMATION UNAVAILABLE FOR object = name
Explanation: One member of the DB2 data sharing group was unable to obtain information from another member
for one of these reasons:
v Overflow of the maximum buffer area sent to the DB2 subsystem running the DISPLAY. This buffer area contains
the DISPLAY information.
v Problems occurred while requesting DISPLAY DB information from peer DB2 subsystems.
Terms pertinent to this message:
object Either DATABASE or SPACE
name The name of the DATABASE or SPACE
User response:
v Issue DISPLAY GROUP to see if any DB2 members are down or unresponsive and then reissue the DISPLAY
DATABASE command.
v Specify individual database names or space names instead of specifying '*'.
DSNT816I csect-name THE REAL-TIME STATISTICS COLLECTION PROCESS IS STOPPED

Explanation: The system could not find the specified module in the indicated library (private library, job library, or
link library).
System action: The utility job is abended.
System programmer response: The last three characters of the module name indicate the DB2 release level of the
subsystem identified in the parameters passed to DSNUTILB. However, LOAD could not find the release dependent
utility module for that release in the indicated library. This is probably a maintenance problem.
User response: Ensure that the load module library is indicated correctly and that the indicated library contains the
requested program. If the indicated library does not contain the requested program, contact the system programmer.

Explanation: This message displays the utility statements that occur before and after a syntax error, as they were
provided as input to the utility parser.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
input-record
The utility statements.
If the RUNSTATS utility used a statistics profile, the control statement might contain references to the
nonexistent objects THIS.TABLE and THIS.TS, which did not appear in the submitted control statement. Such
references are added only when they are required to form a complete utility control statement and are
otherwise meaningless.
An additional error message follows this message and identifies why the utility statement caused a parser error. A
maximum of 500 DSNU005I messages are issued after syntax error. In the final DSNU005I instance, the message text
is DSNU005I STATEMENT ECHOING TERMINATED.
System action: The action depends on the type of message that follows the follows the DSNU005I message:
v For (RC8) messages, processing ends and the utility cannot be restarted.
v For (RC0) or warning (RC4) messages, processing continues.
User response: If an error (RC8) message was issued, correct the error, and resubmit the job.
In most cases, you must correct a syntax error in your utility control statement input, which is either the SYSIN data
set, or the UTSTMT input to the utility stored procedures DSNUTILS or DSNUTILU. If the utility input specifies USE
PROFILE and the DSNU005I messages are preceded by message DSNU1368I, the syntax error must be corrected in
the statistics profile for the indicated table in the SYSIBM.SYSTABLES_PROFILES table. If the utility control statement
in error was produced by a separate database administration tool, contact the service provider for that tool.
If this message contains indecipherable statements, see the information about utility control statements and the rules
about encoding them in EBCDIC or Unicode.

Explanation: An entry with the same qualifier was found in the SYSIBM.SYSUTIL table for a job that was
previously terminated.
System action: The utility job is abended with reason code X'00E40018'.
User response: If you issued the job in order to re-run the utility, then use the -TERM utility command to delete the
entry that has the same qualifier from the SYSIBM.SYSUTIL table. If the job has no relation to the SYSIBM.SYSUTIL
entry job, then use a new qualifier.
DSNU014I csect-name JOB WITH DUPLICATE UTILID CURRENTLY EXECUTING
Explanation: A job with the same qualifier was found to be executing.
System action: Utility processing is terminated.
User response: If the job with the same qualifier that is currently executing is correct, either wait for the job to
complete before using the same qualifier, or use another qualifier. If the job currently executing is incorrect, the
-TERM command can be used to terminate it, and the failing job can be resubmitted. Do not -TERM UTILITY a
utility job step that is currently active in REORG beyond the UNLOAD phase.
DSNU015I csect-name JOB WITH UTILID NOT FOUND IN SYSUTIL FOR RESTART

DSNU016I csect-name UTILITY BATCH MEMORY EXECUTION ABENDED, REASON=X0rrr cause
Explanation: The utility batch address space has abended. If X'0rrr' is four characters in length (that is, X'00C1'), the
abend was a system X'rrr' abend. If X'0rrr' is four characters in length and system abend X'000' was indicated, a user
abend was issued. If X'0rrr' is eight characters in length, the abend was a system X'04E' abend, and X'0rrr' is an
abend reason code.
If the value of general register 2 is not zero, then cause will contain CAUSE=X'cccccccc' where X'cccccccc' is the value
of general register 2. This information is for service purposes only.
System action: The utility job is abended. The SYSIBM.SYSUTIL entry for the job is retained in the SYSUTIL table.
System programmer response: If a system abend was encountered (4 characters), refer to the appropriate MVS
publication. If an eight-character abend reason code was encountered, analyze the values in the SYSIBM.SYSUTIL
directory table.
User response: Consult the system programmer to obtain information on failure analysis. If the cause of the failure
is correctable, the utility job can be restarted. If the error cannot be corrected, use the -TERM UTILITY command to
delete the failing job's utility ID from SYSIBM.SYSUTIL.

Explanation: The database services address space has abended. If X'0rrr' is four hexadecimal digits in length (for
example, X'00C1'), the abend was an MVS X'rrr' abend. If X'0rrr' is eight hexadecimal digits in length, the abend was
a DB2 subsystem X'04E' abend, and X'0rrr' is an abend reason code.
If the value of general register 2 is not zero, then cause will contain CAUSE=X'cccccccc' where X'cccccccc' is the value
of general register 2. This information is for service purposes only.
For example, one possible reason, among many, for this message is that catalog tables contain invalid data that was
updated by the use of SQL statements or by tools. When such updates introduce invalid data, they can cause
unpredictable results, including abends for RUNSTATS and other utilities
System action: The utility job is abended. The entry for the job is retained in the SYSIBM.SYSUTIL table.
System programmer response: If an MVS system abend was encountered (4 hexadecimal digits), refer to the
appropriate MVS publication. If an abend reason code was encountered (8 hexadecimal digits), look up the reason
code. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: Consult with the system programmer to obtain information about failure analysis. If the cause of the
failure is correctable, the utility job can be restarted. If the error cannot be corrected, the -TERM command should be
used to delete the failing job's utility id from SYSIBM.SYSUTIL.
If you suspect that the error is the result of invalid data in the catalog, run the RUNSTATS utility at the table space
level to correct the data.

DSNU018I csect-name JOB IS NOT RESTARTABLE DUE TO -START ACCESS FORCE COMMAND
Explanation: A utility job was submitted to restart a utility job that previously failed. Although the
SYSIBM.SYSUTIL entry for the specified qualifier was found, the job is not restartable because of a -START
DATABASE ACCESS FORCE command. The -START DATABASE ACCESS FORCE command deleted the
utility-in-process state of one or more (but not all) target objects in the job.
System action: The utility job is abended with reason code X'00E40018'.
User response: If the specified qualifier is correct, use the -TERM UTILITY command to terminate the utility and
resubmit the job as a nonrestartable job. If the -TERM UTILITY command fails, use the -START DATABASE ACCESS
FORCE command to force ALL target objects (table spaces and indexes) in the job. When the last object is forced, the
SYSIBM.SYSUTIL record is deleted. If the qualifier is incorrect, correct it and restart the job.
DSNU019I csect-name THIS UTILITY IS NOT ALLOWED AT A DB2 TRACKER SITE
Explanation: When a DB2 subsystem serves as a tracker site, it cannot run utility csect-name. A DB2 subsystem is
also a tracker site if the value of subsystem parameter TRKRSITE is YES. You may run only the following utilities at
a tracker site DB2:
v REPORT
v RECOVER without the TORBA, TOLOGPOINT, or TOCOPY options
v DIAGNOSE
System action: The utility terminates.
System programmer response: If this DB2 subsystem does not need to serve as a remote site tracker system, remove
its tracker site status before re-trying the utility. You may remove the tracker site status by stopping the DB2
subsystem, then restarting it with TRKRSITE = NO.
User response: Contact the system programmer.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU020I csect-name JOB STEP INCOMPLETE

Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU030I csect-name UNABLE TO ALLOCATE dsn, RC=rr, CODE=ccc
Explanation: The utility was unable to allocate a necessary image copy data set. dsn is the data set name that the
utility attempted to dynamically allocate. rr is the return code from the MVS dynamic allocation service, and ccc is
the reason code associated with the return code.
System action: The utility proceeds along one or the following paths:
If the data set was an incremental image copy data set, the utility proceeds as if it and any later incremental image
copies did not exist.
If the data set was a full image copy data set, the utility attempts to use the most recent prior full image copy data
set.
If the data set is used by the COPYTOCOPY utility, and the utility job step includes an OPTIONS control statement
with the EVENT(ITEMERROR,SKIP) option, COPYTOCOPY processes the next item in the list.
The allocation failure may create other problems that will cause the utility to fail. This is indicated by other messages.
System programmer response: If the utility fails because of the allocation error (as shown by a subsequent
message), correct the error, then resubmit the job.
User response: If the job fails, contact the system programmer.
Problem determination: Refer to the appropriate MVS publication for a complete description of the possible return
and reason codes from dynamic allocation.
DSNU031I UNABLE TO action dsn, RC=rc, CODE=rsn

DSNU086I csect-name ttttt I/O ERRORS ON SPACE= dddddddd. DATA SET NUMBER= nnn. I/O ERROR PAGE RANGE= aaaaaa, bbbbbb.
Explanation: DB2 detected an error. This message is issued for, but not limited to the following reasons:
v I/O errors were detected on the named object. ttttt is either 'READ' or 'WRITE'. nnn; is the data set number. aaaaaa
is the first damaged page and bbbbbb is the last damaged page of the data set.
v A broken page was detected.
v A page parity error was detected for a 'must complete' agent.
v A read or write I/O error was detected. A LPL recovery might be in progress so the page is added to the WEPR
instead of the LPL.
System action: Processing continues, but the pages within the error range are no longer accessible.
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
System programmer response: Determine the appropriate level of recovery, and invoke the recovery utility. If
user-defined data sets are being used and full data set or table space RECOVER is to be used, then, prior to invoking
the RECOVER utility, the table space must be stopped, new data set(s) defined, and the table space restarted. If the
data set is part of a ROSHARE READ database, determine whether it was a link or DASD failure. It there was a link
failure, then fix the link, and issue a -START DATABASE with the ACCESS(FORCE) parameter. If the error was
caused by a DASD failure, then correct the problem from the system on which the database was defined as
ROSHARE OWNER.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference. for a discussion of database recovery procedures.
An IOS (I/O subsystem) message might be included on the MVS console SYSLOG indicating the type of I/O error
that occurred. If an IOS message was issued, follow the Problem Determination directions for the message.

added or deleted from SYSIN.
System action: Utility processing is terminated. The utility job step remains in SYSIBM.SYSUTIL in the stopped
state.
User response: Restart the utility job with the statements in the same order as they were in when the job was first
run. If a statement was modified, change the statement back to the format in the original invocation and restart the
job. Utility statements should not be altered for restart.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU096I csect-name OPERAND operand INCONSISTENT WITH LAST INVOCATION
Explanation: When the utility job step was restarted, the indicated operand was found to be inconsistent with the
restart point.
System action: The restart of utility processing is not initiated.
Operator response: An operator with SYSOPR authority can terminate the utility job step (this may not be
necessary). A REORG utility that is beyond the UNLOAD phase should rarely be terminated.
User response: To restart, restore the operand to its prior definition. If this is not acceptable, terminate the utility job
step, take corrective action, and resubmit the job.

Explanation: The request to the IRLM to obtain or release a lock failed for the reasons specified in return-code and
reason-code. In a non data-sharing environment, the requested lock is the utility serialization lock. In a data sharing
environment, the requested lock is the utility serialization lock, the utility identifier lock, or the utility execution lock.
The type of request is indicated by req-type.
System action: Utility and command processing terminates.
System programmer response: Determine the cause of the IRLM error and take appropriate action.
User response: Refer to the IRLM messages and codes section for problem determination and the appropriate
action. Restart the utility by specifying the RESTART parameter, or terminate the utility with the -TERM command
and then resubmit the job. If this message was received during the -DIS UTIL, -TERM UTIL, or -START DATABASE
ACCESS(FORCE) command, then the command can be reissued.
Problem determination: Obtain the system console log output, dump, and SYS1.LOGREC information. If you
suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the
problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.

DSNU100I csect-name USERID = userid MEMBER = member-name UTILID = utilid PROCESSING UTILITY STATEMENT statement-number UTILITY = utility-name PHASE = utility-phase COUNT = object-count NUMBER OF OBJECTS IN LIST = list-size LAST OBJECT STARTED = last-started STATUS = STOPPED
Explanation: This message displays output from the DISPLAY UTILITY command.
The DISPLAY UTILITY output begins with one of the following messages, depending on the status of the first utility
that is reported:
 DSNU100I - A stopped utility
This message is displayed if the utility is stopped.
 DSNU105I - An active utility
This message is displayed if the utility is active.
 DSNU106I - A terminating utility
This message is displayed if the utility is in the process of terminating.
The initial DSNU100I, DSNU105I, or DSNU106I message can be followed by additional instances of these messages
depending on the qualifying utility jobs.
The initial status messages are followed by one or more of the following messages:
v DSNU107I - Invalid member name
v DSNU108I - Invalid use of the MEMBER option
v DSNU111I - Subtask information
v DSNU116I - RECOVER utility LOGAPPLY phase
v DSNU347I - Deadline information for REORG INDEX or REORG TABLESPACE
v DSNU383I - LOG phase information for REORG INDEX or REORG TABLESPACE
v DSNU384I - MAXRO, LONGLOG, and DELAY information for REORG INDEX or REORG TABLESPACE
v DSN9022I - Normal completion
The following sections explain each of the messages that might be issued as a result of running the DISPLAY
UTILITY command:
 DSNU100I - A stopped utility:
Message DSNU100I is displayed for each instance of a stopped utility.
 DSNU100I csect-name USERID = userid
MEMBER = member-name
UTILID = utilid
PROCESSING UTILITY STATEMENT statement-number
UTILITY = utility-name
PHASE = utility-phase COUNT = object-count
NUMBER OF OBJECTS IN LIST = list-size
LAST OBJECT STARTED = last-started
STATUS = STOPPED
The specified utility job stopped during processing for one of the following reasons:
v The utility is REORG INDEX or REORG TABLESPACE, and the UNLOAD(PAUSE) option was specified. This
option causes the utility to stop after it unloads the data. Therefore, the utility is stopped in the RELOAD phase.
v A DB2 subsystem failure or cancellation occurred. For example, a cancellation occurs if you issue the STOP DB2
command.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
userid The user ID that ran the utility job.
member-name
The name of the DB2 member in a data-sharing environment. In a non-data-sharing environment,
member-name is blank.
utilid The utility ID.
statement-number
The utility statement number.
utility-name
The name of the utility.
utility-phase
The phase in which the utility is to be restarted if the utility job step is restarted with the RESTART(PHASE)
option. This value applies only to utilities that have phases.
object-count
The number of objects that were processed in a utility phase. The object-count field is relevant only to the
following utilities:
CHECK INDEX, LOAD, REBUILD INDEX, REORG INDEX, and REORG TABLESPACE:
The object-count field indicates the number of records that were processed. For the LOG phase of
REORG INDEX and REORG TABLESPACE, this value indicates the number of log records that
were processed. For the SWITCH phase of REORG INDEX and REORG TABLESPACE, this value is
0.
COPY, MERGECOPY, RECOVER (RESTORE phase), and RUNSTATS:
The object-count field indicates the number of pages that were processed.
STOSPACE:
The object-count field indicates the number of table spaces or indexes that were processed.
For all other utilities, ignore the object-count field.
In a data sharing environment, the count is current when the command is issued from the same member on
which the utility is executing. When the command is issued from a different member, the count might lag
substantially. For some utilities in some build phases, the count number is not updated when the command
is issued from a different member.
list-size If the utility is processing a list of objects, the total number of objects in the list. This value might not be
accurate in the UTILINIT phase, which occurs before the list size is determined.
last-started
If the utility is processing a list of objects, the item number of the last object for which processing started.
This value might not be accurate in the UTILINIT phase, which occurs before the list size is determined.

System action: In most cases, processing continues with the following exceptions:
v For each DSNU100I message, DB2 waits for directions to either restart or terminate the utility.
v For each DSNU105I message that was issued because REORG INDEX or REORG TABLESPACE estimated that the
SWITCH phase will not start before the specified deadline, reorganization terminates with message DSNU374I.
v For each DSNU106I message, the utility stops and releases all resources that are associated with the utility. After
the utility terminates, DB2 can reuse the utility ID.
Operator response: For each DSNU100I message, if you need to release the resources that are claimed by the
stopped utility, terminate the utility by issuing the TERM UTILITY command.
User response: The appropriate user response varies depending on the messages that are issued.
v For each DSNU100I message, restart or terminate the utility job step. To restart the job step, follow the directions in
Restarting an online utility (DB2 Utilities). You must have authority to run the indicated utility and to complete
any other utility functions in the utility job step. To terminate the utility, issue the TERM UTILITY command. You
must be the originator or have SYSOPR or SYSADM authority.
v For each DSNU105I message that was issued by REORG INDEX or REORG TABLESPACE, take the actions that are
listed in DSNU374I on page 678.
v For each DSNU107I message, correct the member name and reissue the DISPLAY UTILITY command.
v For the DSNU108I message, make sure that data sharing is active before issuing the DISPLAY UTILITY command
with the MEMBER option.
v In all other cases, no action is necessary.
If you issue a subsequent DISPLAY UTILITY command, any additional processing is reflected in the output. The
output also includes any updates to the DEADLINE, MAXRO, LONGLOG, or DELAY options that were made by an

DSNU103I csect-name - UNABLE TO ACCESS SYSUTIL TABLE AT THIS TIME
Explanation: An -ALTER UTILITY, -DISPLAY UTILITY, or -TERM UTILITY command was issued at the same time
that the DSNDB01.SYSUTILX table space was the object of an active utility job. The utility job might be holding locks
that would cause a deadlock condition to occur.
System action: The command processing is terminated.
User response: Enter the command again. This message is issued in response to each command until the utility
action on the DSNDB01.SYSUTILX table space completes.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU104I csect-name - DSNDB01.SYSUTILX IN A PENDING STATE PROHIBITS FURTHER PROCESSING
Explanation: The -ALTER UTILITY, -TERM UTILITY, or -DISPLAY UTILITY command was issued when the DSNDB01.SYSUTILX table space was in a pending state, which prohibits further processing. The pending state was
either copy or recovery pending.
System action: Command processing is terminated.
System programmer response: Issue a -DISPLAY DATABASE command to determine the state of the DSNDB01.SYSUTILX table space. If the state is copy pending, do a full image copy. If the state is recovery pending,
use the RECOVER utility to recover DSNDB01.SYSUTILX. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report
the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and
DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: Notify the system programmer so that the pending condition can be resolved.

Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU109I csect-name UTILITY utilid CAN ONLY BE TERMINATED OR ALTERED BY MEMBER = member-name
Explanation: The -TERM UTILITY or -ALTER UTILITY command cannot terminate or alter the utility job with
identifier utilid, because it belongs to member member-name of the DB2 data sharing group. Activeutility jobs can be
terminated or altered only from the system on which they were running.
System action: If this message was issued for the -TERM UTILITY command, the command ignores the utilid and
continues to process the next utilid, if any. If this message was issued for the -ALTER UTILITY command, the
command is rejected, and further processing of the command is ended.
User response: Make sure the utilid identifies the utility you want to terminate or alter. If it does, issue the
command from the DB2 member identified in the message.
Severity: 8 (error)

DSNU114I csect-name UTILITY COMMANDS SUBSYSTEM FAILURE, REASON=Xcode
Explanation: This message indicates an abend has occurred in the utility commands subsystem.
System action: The command abends. In the case of the -TERM command, termination actions taken previously
under this command are backed out.
User response: Prior messages and/or the SVC dump identify the failure. If the condition can be corrected, the
command may be reissued.
Problem determination: In most cases, the failure is not user related. In some cases, prior messages indicate a user
error that may be corrected. The problem may be as simple as SYSIBM.SYSUTIL being temporarily locked by another
command or a utility job. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
DSNU115I csect-name utility-name UTILITY WITH UTILID = utilid CAN ONLY BE TERMINATED BY A MEMBER WITH THE SAME RELEASE = release
Explanation: Command TERM UTILITY cannot terminate the utility job with identifier utilid because it belongs to a
member with a release level identified in the message. Some utilities can be terminated only from a member of the
DB2 data sharing group with the same release level.
System action: Command TERM UTILITY is rejected for the indicated utility job.
User response: Make sure the utilid identifies the utility you want to terminate. If it does, issue command TERM
UTILITY from a member with a release level identified in the message in the DB2 data sharing group.

DSNU122I csect-name USER userid NOT AUTHORIZED FOR util-name UTILITY ON THE OBJECT object-type obj-qual.obj-name IN THE IMPLICIT DATABASE db-name
Explanation: User userid attempted to execute a utility util-name against an object in the implicit database db-name.
The user either does not have ownership of the object in the implicit database, has no DSNDB04 authorization or was
not given authorization to execute utilities on object obj-name.
System action: Utility processing is not initiated.
System programmer response: Determine why the user was denied access. Either the authorization should be
corrected, or another authorized user should invoke the utility.
User response: Ensure that the correct database was specified. If this operation involves a table with multilevel
security with row granularity, then this user needs to have a valid security label to execute this utility. If this error
occurred processing a LISTDEF list, alter the list to exclude the objects that lack proper authorization. If the list
cannot be modified, OPTIONS EVENT(ITEMERROR, SKIP) may be used to continue processing when this error
occurs.
Problem determination: The following catalog tables can be examined to determine who has the proper authority:
SYSIBM.SYSUSERAUTH, SYSIBM.SYSDBAUTH, SYSIBM.SYSRESAUTH, SYSIBM.SYSINDEXES (ownership), or
SYSIBM. SYSTABLESPACE (ownership).

Explanation: This message is issued in response to a -TERM UTILITY command. It acknowledges that the request
for termination was received and verified. At the time the -TERM UTILITY request was received, utility 'utility-name'
was ACTIVE in the utility job step identified by UTILID 'utilid'.
System action: DB2 has accepted the request to terminate the indicated utility job step. The utility terminates at its
next cleanup point.
User response: This message is an acknowledgement that the request has been accepted and is in progress.
DSNU161I csect-name - utility-name UTILITY WITH UTILID = util-id CAN NOT BE TERMINATED AT THE DB2 TRACKER SITE
Explanation: DB2 does not permit the termination of certain utilities at a tracker site because terminating these
utilities may leave the target objects in an unpredictable state. The next recovery cycle should cause the utilities to
resolve. You may not terminate the following utilities at a tracker site:
v COPY
v LOAD
v REORG
v REPAIR
System action: The utility does not terminate.
System programmer response: Monitor the status of these utilities after the next tracker site recovery cycle.
User response: Contact the system programmer.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU162I csect-name - utility-name UTILITY WITH UTILID = util-id IS TERMINATING WITH OBJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN STARTED WITH ACCESS(FORCE) AND THEN DROPPED
Explanation: Database objects that are used by the terminating utility were started with the command START
DATABASE ACCESS(FORCE) and then dropped.
System action: Termination process continues.
User response: If the terminating utility is online REORG, TERM UTILITY does not rename and delete residual
DB2-managed or user-defined data sets. You must delete those data sets manually.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU164I csect-name cccccccc UTILITY, UTILID = uuuu ALREADY TERMINATING
Explanation: This message is in response to a -TERM UTILITY command. It indicates that the utility job step
indicated by UTILID 'uuuuu' has already been requested to terminate and is in the process of doing so now.
System action: DB2 is currently in the process of terminating the indicated utility job step. Upon completion, all
resources will have been released to their prior state, and all tracking of the indicated UTILID will have been
removed. At that point, the UTILID is available for reuse.
User response: This message indicates that either the request was redundant, or someone else is also interested in
the termination of the subject utility job step.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU166I csect-name utility-name UTILITY, UTILID = uid NOT EXECUTING, CLEANUP COMPLETE
Explanation: This message is in response to a -TERM UTILITY command. The 'utility-name' utility identified by
UTILID 'uid' was found to be stopped at the time of the request to terminate.
System action: Cleanup is performed for the indicated stopped utility. All resources held by the utility are freed and
all storage of the utility job is deleted. The utility job is no longer restartable.
System programmer response: Resources held by this utility may have prevented applications, commands, and
other utilities from executing. These have been freed, so that the inhibited tasks may now be performed.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU170I csect-name UTILITY JOB TERMINATED BY TERM COMMAND
Explanation: A -TERM UTILITY command was issued for this utility job step.
System action: The executing utility terminates processing and frees all held resources. All storage of the utility job
has been deleted. Therefore, the job is not restartable. Subsequent utilities in the same job step are not executed.
User response: All or portions of the utility job step can be resubmitted as needed.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU172I csect-name UTILITY JOB STOPPED BY STOP DB2 COMMAND
Explanation: A -STOP DB2 command was issued during execution of the utility job step.
System action: The executing utility stops processing but continues to hold resources. Subsequent utilities in the
same job step are not executed. The storage of the utility job is retained. Therefore, the utility job step is restartable.
User response: Following a -START DB2 command, the utility job step may be restarted. Alternatively, the utility
may be terminated using the -TERM UTILITY command and resubmitted as a new job. A REORG utility that has
passed the UNLOAD phase should rarely be terminated.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU180I csect-name UTILITY IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE utility-name UTILITY UTILID = utility-id OBJECT = space-name.object-name
Explanation: Certain utilities cannot process the same table space or index space at the same time.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
utility-name
The name of the utility.
utility-id
The ID of the utility (UTILID).
space-name
The name of the table space or index space.
object-name
The name of the object.
These objects, or their related log entries, might be target objects of the utilities or a mapping table, or they might be
catalog or directory table spaces that are updated by the utilities. For example, DSNDB06.SYSCOPY is updated by
LOAD.
System action: The starting utility is not initiated, and further utility processing in that utility job step is terminated.
User response: Use the DISPLAY UTILITY command with the utility-id that is provided in the message to determine
when the utility that caused your utility to be rejected is completed.
To avoid this error when running concurrent REBUILD INDEX with SHRLEVEL CHANGE, specify multiple indexes
on a single utility execution instead of invoking multiple utilities.

DSNU181I csect-name RESTART NOT ALLOWED FOR utility-name UTILITY
Explanation: An attempt was made to restart the named utility. DB2 does not allow this utility to be restarted.
System action: Utility processing is abended. Abend reason code 00E40018 might be issued.
System programmer response: If necessary, take actions to prevent access to the table space before terminating the
utility.
User response: Issue the -TERM UTIL command to terminate the utility job and then rerun the job without the
RESTART parameter.
DSNU182I csect-name utility-name MUST BE THE ONLY UTILITY IN SYSIN
Explanation: Utilities must process certain objects alone or in a small logically related group in a single utility
control statement. Also, some utility control statements must be the only control statement in the job step. This
message indicates that one of these restrictions was violated.
The following list gives examples of these restrictions:
v A BACKUP SYSTEM utility control statement must be the only control statement in the job step.
v The CHECK DATA utility must process DSNDB01.SYSUTILX alone. No other objects can be specified in the same
CHECK DATA control statement, and no other control statements can be in the job step.
v The CHECK INDEX utility must process DSNDB01.SYSUTILX indexes alone. No other objects can be specified in
the same CHECK INDEX control statement, and no other control statements can be in the job step.
v The COPY utility must process DSNDB01.SYSUTILX and its indexes alone. No other objects can be specified in the
same COPY control statement, and no other control statements can be in the job step.
v The QUIESCE utility must process DSNDB01.SYSUTILX alone. No other objects can be specified in the same COPY
control statement, and no other control statements can be in the job step.
v The RECOVER utility must process DSNDB01.SYSUTILX and its indexes alone. No other objects can be specified
in the same RECOVER control statement, and no other control statements can be in the job step.
v The RECOVER utility must process DSNDB01.DBD01 and its indexes alone. No other objects can be specified in
the same RECOVER control statement, and no other control statements can be in the job step.
v A REORG INDEX utility control statement for DSNDB01.SYSUTILX indexes must be the only control statement in
the job step.
v During enabling-new-function mode, a REORG TABLESPACE utility control statement for DSNDB01.DBD01 or DSNDB01.SPT01 must be the only control statement in the job step.
v The REPAIR utility must process DSNDB01.SYSUTILX and its indexes alone. No other objects can be specified in
the same REPAIR control statement, and no other control statements can be in the job step.
v A RESTORE SYSTEM utility control statement must be the only control statement in the job step.
In most cases, these utilities tolerate the presence of DIAGNOSE, LISTDEF, OPTIONS, and TEMPLATE control
statements, if those statements are required for processing.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
utility-name
The name of the DB2 utility.
System action: If any work was performed by utilities in the same utility job step before the identified utility, that
work persists. However, the utility that is identified in this message and any subsequent utilities are not executed,
and the utility job step is placed in the stopped state.
User response: See the information about the failing utility for specific restrictions, which vary by utility.
Then, make the failing job step and control statement small enough to avoid the error. Remove other control
statements and other objects from the failing statement until the error goes away. Remove the control statements that
follow the failing statement and run them in a separate job step. If the error still occurs, remove the control
statements that precede the failing statement, except those statements that are required to run the statement, such as
TEMPLATE statements. If the error still occurs and the control statement lists multiple objects, put each object in
separate control statements. Some grouping of objects might be possible in some cases, such as DSNDB01.SYSUTILX
with its indexes.

DSNU183I csect-name - utility-name UTILITY NOT COMPATIBLE WITH OTHER ACTIVE UTILITIES
Explanation: The utility identified by 'utility-name' is executing against table space DSNDB01.SYSUTILX. This table
space is integral to controlling the execution of utilities. Control over other utilities running at the same time would
be lost if the utility were allowed to execute. Therefore, the identified utility must be executed alone. There must be
no other active DB2 utilities in the system.
System action: Utility execution is terminated.
User response: Rerun the utility when there are no other utilities executing. Use the -DISPLAY UTILITY command
to see what utilities are ACTIVE. Utilities in the STOPPED state are allowed.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU184I csect-name - DO NOT RECOVER OBJECT qual.obj-nm UNTIL THE NEXT TRACKER SITE RECOVERY CYCLE
Explanation: If DB2 detects an inconsistency relating to a utility's status on object 'qual.obj-nm' at the tracker site,
DB2 issues this message. This event can occur if the SYSUTIL record for the utility either does not exist, or reflects
incorrect information about hte status of the utility.
System action: The utility issues ABEND04E with return code 00E40009.
System programmer response: Wait for the next recovery cycle to recover the object named in this message. If the
object named in this message is a catalog or directory object, you cannot recover this object, or any other objects in
the list of catalog and directory objects, or any user data or indexes. Wait until the next recovery cycle to recover the
object.
User response: Contact the system programmer.

DSNU258I csect-name BUILD PHASE STATISTICS. NUMBER OF INDEXES = mmm
Explanation: This message is issued at normal completion of the BUILD phase of the LOAD or REORG or
REBUILD INDEX utility. The number of indexes that were updated is indicated as 'mmm'.
System action: The BUILD phase of either the LOAD or REORG or REBUILD INDEX utility is completed. Upon
completion of the utility job step, they are available for REFERENCE processing.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU259I csect-name BUILD PHASE COMPLETE, ELAPSED TIME = hh/mm/ss
Explanation: This message is issued at the normal completion of the BUILD phase of the REORG, LOAD, and
REBUILD INDEX utilities. The time that has elapsed between the beginning of the phase and the completion of this
phase was 'hh' hours, 'mm' minutes, and 'ss' seconds.
System action: Processing continues to the next phase of the LOAD or REORG or REBUILD INDEX utility. If this is
the last phase, processing continues to the next utility statement in the utility job step, if any.
DSNU260I csect-name obj-type obj-qual.obj-name IS EMPTY
Explanation: This message is issued as a warning when REBUILD INDEX(ALL) or REORG TABLESPACE are
executed on an empty table space.
This message is also issued when COPY detects that the first space map page in the table space or partition is
missing. This is an error condition that might be caused by a delete and redefine of the data set outside of DB2, or by
a previous DB2 failure that occurred on the data set.
System action: For REBUILD INDEX or REORG TABLESPACE, the return code of 4 will allow the next utility
function in the job step, if any, to be initiated.
For COPY, the table space, index space, or partition being copied will be placed in recover pending status. The return
code of 8 will prohibit further utility processing in the job step.
System programmer response: If the return code is 8, the table space, indexspace, or partition being copied should
be recovered with the RECOVER utility.
User response: Notify the system programmer if the return code is 8. If the return code is 4, no action is required.
Severity: 4 (warning) or 8 (error)
DSNU269I csect-name FIELD field-name IS NOT ALLOWED
Explanation: You have specified a GENERATED ALWAYS column in the field specification list. Only a column
defined as GENERATED BY DEFAULT is allowed to be specified in the field specification list.

DSNU289I csect-name type REORG LIMITS HAVE BEEN MET
Explanation: The REORG utility is indicating whether any specified limits have been met. For REORG
TABLESPACE, this might be the OFFPOSLIMIT or the INDREFLIMIT. For REORG INDEX, this is the
LEAFDISTLIMIT. type values:
NO If no limits are met.
blank If at least one limit is met.
System action: Utility processing continues.
User response: If the REPORTONLY option is specified and the result of this job step is not used to conditionally
execute other job steps, examine the utility messages for this table space, partition, or index to determine if a REORG
should be performed.
Severity: The return codes are:
1 (informational)
If no limit is met.
2 (informational)
If at least one limit is met.
DSNU290I csect-name type REORG WILL BE PERFORMED
Explanation: The REORG utility is indicating whether any specified limits have been met and whether a REORG
will be performed. For REORG TABLESPACE, this might be the OFFPOSLIMIT or the INDREFLIMIT. For REORG
INDEX, this is the LEAFDISTLIMIT. type values:
NO If no limits are met.
blank If at least one limit is met.
System action: Utility processing continues. A REORG is performed if any limits are met.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU291I MAXIMUM COMPOSITE UNLOAD RECORD SIZE TOO LARGE FOR SORT. SORTDATA KEYWORD IS IGNORED.
Explanation: The SORTDATA keyword was specified for a REORG utility job. However, the largest possible record
in the table space, prefixed by the largest key, produces a composite record that is too large to be processed by the
SORT component. The SORTDATA keyword is ignored.
System action: Processing continues normally.
User response: If you must use SORTDATA for the table space, try reducing the size of either the largest record or
key field by redefining the table. In some cases, changing a field from LONG VARCHAR to VARCHAR with a
specified maximum length might help.
Problem determination: This problem should only occur on a table space with a 32KB page size. Analyze the
requirement for maximum data length in VARCHAR and LONG VARCHAR columns to see if a shorter length can be
specified. It might be necessary to remove the SORTDATA keyword from the utility statement.
Severity: 0
DSNU292I csect-name - -ALTER UTILITY CANNOT APPLY TO THIS UTILITY, REASON=c
Explanation: The -ALTER UTILITY command applies only to a job that is executing REBUILD with SHRLEVEL
CHANGE, REORG with SHRLEVEL REFERENCE, or REORG with SHRLEVEL CHANGE. In addition, if the -ALTER
UTILITY command specifies MAXRO, LONGLOG, or DELAY, the job must be executing REBUILD with SHRLEVEL
CHANGE, or, REORG with SHRLEVEL CHANGE.
The reason code indicates the specific type of error:
1 The job to which the -ALTER UTILITY command applies is not executing REBUILD with SHRLEVEL
CHANGE, REORG with SHRLEVEL REFERENCE, or REORG with SHRLEVEL CHANGE.
2 The job to which the -ALTER UTILITY command applies is executing REORG with SHRLEVEL
REFERENCE, but the -ALTER UTILITY command specifies MAXRO, LONGLOG, or DELAY.
3 The job to which the -ALTER UTILITY command applies is executing REBUILD with SHRLEVEL change,
but the -ALTER UTILITY command specifies DEADLINE.
System action: -ALTER UTILITY does not execute.
User response: Apply -ALTER UTILITY to a job that is executing the proper utility.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU293I csect-name - REORG WITH SHRLEVEL REFERENCE OR CHANGE CANNOT APPLY TO THE name TABLE SPACE
Explanation: REORG with SHRLEVEL REFERENCE or CHANGE cannot operate on the following catalog and
directory table spaces: DSNDB06.SYSDBASE, DSNDB06.SYSDBAUT, DSNDB06.SYSGROUP, DSNDB06.SYSPLAN, DSNDB06.SYSVIEWS, and DSNDB01.DBD01.
System action: REORG does not execute.
User response: Execute REORG with SHRLEVEL NONE.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU294I csect-name - LARGEST COMPOSITE RECORD IS TOO BIG FOR REORG WITH SHRLEVEL CHANGE
Explanation: SHRLEVEL CHANGE was specified for a REORG utility job, and the table has a clustering index.
However, the largest possible record in the table space, prefixed by the largest key, produces a composite record that
is too large to be processed by the SORT component. If the largest possible composite record to be sorted exceeds
32760 bytes in length, which is the maximum record size for a BSAM data set, REORG cannot operate if SHRLEVEL
CHANGE is specified.
System action: REORG does not execute.
User response: Execute REORG with SHRLEVEL NONE or REFERENCE and specify SORTDATA NO. If you must
use SHRLEVEL CHANGE for the table space, try reducing the size of either the largest record or key field by
redefining the table. In some cases, changing a field from LONG VARCHAR to VARCHAR with a specified
maximum length might help.
Problem determination: This problem should only occur on a table space with a 32KB page size. Analyze the
requirement for maximum data length in VARCHAR and LONG VARCHAR columns to see whether a shorter length
can be specified.

DSNU295I csect-name - IN UTILTERM PHASE OF REORG WITH SHRLEVEL REFERENCE OR CHANGE, DATA SET name COULD NOT BE DELETED
Explanation: For the area (table space or partition) being reorganized, REORG with SHRLEVEL REFERENCE or
CHANGE unloads data from the original data sets and reloads data into shadow data sets. REORG then exchanges
the names of the original and shadow data sets. The original name of a data set is in the form
catname.DSNDBx.dbname.psname.I0001.Annn. The shadow name of a data set is in the form
catname.DSNDBx.dbname.psname.J0001.Annn. REORG uses such data sets for indexes as well as data.
If a data set is DB2-managed, the utilterm phase of REORG deletes the shadow data set, which was the original data
set. This message indicates that the shadow data set name could not be deleted.
System action: REORG continues execution, but it does not delete the specified data set.
User response: Try to delete the data set. If you cannot delete it, notify the system programmer.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU296I csect-name - IN REORG WITH SHRLEVEL REFERENCE OR CHANGE, DATA SET name DOES NOT EXIST, CONTEXT=c
Explanation: For the area (table space or partition) being reorganized, REORG with SHRLEVEL REFERENCE or
CHANGE unloads data from the original data sets and reloads data into shadow data sets. REORG then exchanges
the names of the original and shadow data sets, using temporary names during the renaming. The original name of a
data set is in the form catname.DSNDBx.dbname.psname.I0001.Annn. The shadow name of a data set is in the form
catname.DSNDBx.dbname.psname.J0001.Annn. The temporary name of a data set is in the form
catname.DSNDBx.dbname.psname.T0001.Annn. REORG uses such data sets for indexes as well as data.
During its initialization, REORG cannot execute if:
v Data sets with the temporary names already exist
v DB2-managed data sets with the shadow names already exist
v User-managed data sets with the shadow names do not already exist
To exchange the names of the original and shadow data sets, REORG renames in the following ways:
1 In the switch phase, it renames the original data set from the original name to the temporary name.
2 In the switch phase, it renames the shadow data set from the shadow name to the original name.
3 In the utilterm phase, it renames the original data set from the temporary name to the shadow name (for
user-managed data sets). It deletes the temporary name for DB2-managed data sets.
If either a -TERM UTILITY command is issued, or the REORG switch phase is restarted after REORG has begun
renaming data sets, the names revert back to their original form prior to the utilterm phase of REORG:
The context code indicates the specific type of error:
1
During the switch phase of REORG, on rename 1, REORG detected that a data set with an original name
does not exist. This error condition can arise for a DB2-managed or user-managed data set.
During the switch phase restart or a -TERM UTILITY during the switch phase, on rename 4, REORG
detected that a data set with an original name does not exist. This error condition can arise for a
DB2-managed or user-managed data set.
2
During the switch phase of REORG, on rename 2, REORG detected that a data set with a shadow name
does not exist. This error condition can arise for a DB2-managed or user-managed data set.
During the switch phase restart or a -TERM UTILITY during the switch phase, on rename 5, REORG
detected that a data set with a shadow name does not exist. This error condition can arise for a
DB2-managed or user-managed data set.
3 During the utilterm phase of REORG, on rename 3, REORG detected that a data set with a temporary name
does not exist. This error condition can arise for a user-managed data set.
7 During initialization of REORG, REORG detected that the shadow data set did not exist. This error can only
occur with a table space, index, or partition that is stored in user-managed data sets.
System action: For context codes 1 or 2, utility processing is abended. ABEND reason code 00E4031B is issued. The
object is left in a recovery pending state.
For context code 3, the utility job step that caused the function to be requested continues with no renaming. The
utility job is placed in the stopped state. The object is left in a recovery pending state, and a message will be issued.
For context code 7, REORG does not execute.
For context codes 1, 2, or 3, the following messages are issued:
v If the data set is part of a nonpartitioned table space, the object is the table space, and the message is DSNU562I.
v If the data set is part of a partition of a table space, the object is the partition, and the message is DSNU560I.
v If the data set is part of a nonpartitioned index, the object is the index, and the message is DSNU557I.
v If the data set is part of a partition of a partitioned index, the object is the partition of the index, and the message
is DSNU559I.
User response: For context codes 1 or 2, execute the RECOVER TABLESPACE or RECOVER or REBUILD utilities.
For context code 3, do nothing.
For context code 7, define all shadow objects prior to running REORG.
Severity: 4 (warning) or 8 (error)
DSNU297I csect-name COMPOSITE RECORD SIZE TOO LARGE FOR table-name
Explanation: The size of the record that would be unloaded for REORG DISCARD or REORG UNLOAD
EXTERNAL is greater than the largest allowed data set logical record length (32760 bytes).
System action: The utility will terminate with a return code of 8.
User response: If you are attempting to discard records during REORG, you will have to use SQL to DELETE the
records prior to the REORG. If you are attempting to unload records in an external format, you must use an
application instead. If you are using the SORTDATA option with REORG UNLOAD EXTERNAL or REORG
DISCARD, try removing the SORTDATA keyword.
Problem determination: This problem will most likely occur only on a table with BLOB, CLOB, or DBCLOB
columns.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU298I csect-name - RESTART NOT ALLOWED IN phase-name PHASE OF REORG WITH SHRLEVEL REFERENCE OR CHANGE
Explanation: An attempt was made to restart the REORG utility with SHRLEVEL REFERENCE or SHRLEVEL
CHANGE in the phase-name phase. DB2 does not allow you to restart the REORG utility with SHRLEVEL
REFERENCE or SHRLEVEL CHANGE in that phase.
System action: Utility processing abends. Abend reason code 00E40018 or 00E40310 might be issued.
System programmer response: If necessary, take actions to prevent access to the table space or partition before
terminating the utility.
User response: Issue the -TERM UTILITY command to terminate the utility job; then rerun the job without the
RESTART parameter.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU299I csect-name CHARACTER CONVERSION FROM CCSID from-ccsid TO CCSID to-ccsid FAILED WITH ERROR CODE error-code FOR object-type object-qualifier.object-name additional-information.

8 Length exception, such as expansion required for PC MIXED data that exceeds the maximum
length of the string.
12 Invalid code point.
16 Form exception, such as invalid MIXED data.
20 Conversion procedure error, such as an error during Unicode/390 stage 2 conversions or an exit
that set the length control field of the string to an invalid value.
24 Conversion services have not been setup correctly or the conversion is not supported.
object-type
The type of the failed object.
An object-type of UNKNOWN indicates that a failure has occurred in the conversion service. DB2 reason
code 00E400D0 is issued, and provides additional information.
object-qualifier.object-name
The table creator ID followed by the table name. If the object is a user security label or row security label,
only object-name is shown.
additional-information
Additional information about the table, which is provided only when object-type is TABLE.
COLUMN column-name
The column name of the failing object. This column could be either the target or the source of the
conversion.
blank No additional information is provided for other values of object-type.
System action: The utility job is terminated.
User response: Generate a dump by adding the DIAGNOSE ABEND statement in the utility job and re-running the
utility. If the error can be fixed, correct the error and resubmit the utility. Otherwise, issue the TERM utility command
to terminate the utility.
If the error is related to security labels, use only security labels that characters that are not substituted during
conversion from one CCSID to another. For example, the following national characters might be substituted:
v @ (X'7C')
v # (X'7B')
v $ (X'5B')
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and

DSNU300I csect-name (RE)LOAD PHASE COMPLETE, ELAPSED TIME = hh/mm/ss
Explanation: The reload phase of the REORG or LOAD utility has completed normally. The elapsed time for the
execution was 'hh' hours, 'mm' minutes, and 'ss' seconds.
DSNU301I csect-name - KEYWORD 'SORTDATA' SPECIFIED AND/OR KEYWORD 'NOSYSREC' WAS SPECIFIED BUT NO CLUSTERINGINDEX EXISTS, KEYWORD IS IGNORED
Explanation: The 'SORTDATA' keyword was specified or the 'NOSYSREC' keyword was specified for a REORG
utility job, or implied by the use of SHRLEVEL CHANGE. But it was found that no clustering index existed for the
table space being reorganized. The keyword is ignored and processing continues normally.
System action: Processing continues normally.
User response: If a clustering index was expected to be found for the table space being reorganized, determine the
reason the index could not be found.
Problem determination: Probably a user error. Determine if a cluster index should be defined on one of the tables
in the table space being reorganized. If so, define the cluster index; otherwise, remove the 'SORTDATA' and/or
'NOSYSREC' keyword from the utility statement if necessary.
Severity: 0
DSNU302I csect-name (RE)LOAD PHASE STATISTICS - NUMBER OF INPUT RECORDS PROCESSED = nnnnnnnn
Explanation: This message is issued at the normal completion of the RELOAD phase of the REORG utility and the
LOAD phase of the LOAD utility.
It indicates the number of records processed from the input record data set (that is, the data set identified either by
the JCL DD statement identified in the UNLDDN option for REORG or the INDDN option for LOAD).
System action: The LOAD or REORG utility completes the phase in which the records are (re-)introduced into the
DB2 database. This is also the last phase of the utility unless there are some indexes that need to be built and/or
updated.
User response: The user can verify that the number of records (re-)loaded is consistent with expectations. For
example, in REORG it matches the total number of records unloaded. For LOAD, it matches the number of records
submitted minus the number of records reported rejected.

DSNU303I csect-name (RE)LOAD PHASE STATISTICS - NUMBER OF RECORDS= nnnnnn FOR TABLE table-name PART=part-number
Explanation: This message is issued at the normal completion of the RELOAD phase of the REORG utility and the
LOAD phase of the LOAD utility.
It indicates the number of records loaded into PART 'part-number' of 'table-name' from the source record data set.
This data set is identified by the JCL DD statement in the UNLDDN option for REORG, or the INDDN option for
LOAD.
This message is repeated for each INTO TABLE PART clause in the LOAD utility statement or each TABLESPACE
PART clause in the REORG utility statement.
System action: The LOAD or RELOAD phase maintains a separate count for each table part. Rejected rows are not
included in the count. Each count is reported as a separate message at the end of the LOAD or RELOAD phase.
The user can verify the number of records loaded or reloaded into the table part. In REORG, it should match the
number of records unloaded for that table part. In LOAD, it should match the number of records processed.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU304I csect-name (RE)LOAD PHASE STATISTICS - NUMBER OF RECORDS = nnnnnn FOR TABLE table-name
Explanation: This message is issued at the normal completion of the RELOAD phase of the REORG utility and the
LOAD phase of the LOAD utility.
It indicates the number of records loaded into TABLE 'table-name' from the source record data set (that is, the data
set identified by the JCL DD statement identified in the UNLDDN option for REORG, or the INDDN option for
LOAD).
This message is repeated for each TABLE loaded by the current REORG or LOAD utility statement.
If the LOAD or REORG was restarted in a LOAD or RELOAD phase from the last commit point (i.e., the 'RESTART'
parm was specified), 'nnnnnn' indicates the number of records loaded after the restart.
System action: The LOAD or RELOAD phase maintains a separate count for each table populated by this phase.
Rejected rows are not included in the count. Each count is reported as a separate message at the end of the LOAD or
RELOAD phase.
The user can verify that the number of records (re-)loaded into the table is consistent with expectations. For example,
in REORG it matches the number of records unloaded for that table. For LOAD, it matches the number of records
processed.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU305I csect-name - TABLE=table-name HAS AN INCOMPLETE TABLE DEFINITION
Explanation: Table 'table-name' does not have an index defined to enforce the uniqueness of its primary key or
unique key.
System action: Processing stops. No table in the table space is loaded.
User response: The user can resubmit the LOAD job after performing one of the following:
v Creating a unique index over the table's primary key
v Creating a unique index over the table's unique key(s)
v Dropping the definition of the table's primary key
v Dropping the definition of the table's unique key(s)
Problem determination: Issue SQL SELECT against the catalog to determine which indexes and relations exist
against 'table-name'. Determine whether uniqueness of the primary key or unique key has been guaranteed through
omission or through faulty definition of an index.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU306I csect-name - UNABLE TO DRAIN WRITERS FROM object-type object-name
Explanation: The utility was unable to drain the writers from an object because the resource was unavailable. The
object is identified by type and name. Message DSNT500I tells why the resource was unavailable. If the QUIESCE
utility issues this message, DSNT500I is not issued, but message DSNT501I might be issued.
System action: Utility processing terminates.
Problem determination: Refer to message DSNT500I or DSNT501I.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU307I csect-name PARENT TABLE parent-table-name OF table-name IN RELATIONSHIP relationship-name HAS AN INCOMPLETE TABLE DEFINITION
Explanation: The 'table-name' identifies the target table of the job for the LOAD utility or the dependent table to be
checked by the CHECK DATA utility. The 'parent-table-name' identifies the parent table of the target table for the
LOAD utility or the dependent table for the CHECK DATA utility in RELATIONSHIP 'relationship-name'. The
primary index of PARENT TABLE 'parent-table-name' has been dropped.
This message is repeated for each incompletely defined parent table in each relationship where the target table is a
child.
System action: The LOAD and CHECK DATA utilities stop further processing. No data is loaded by the LOAD
utility and no relationships are checked by the CHECK DATA utility.
User response: Check the existence of the primary index and its parent tables identified by RELATIONSHIP
'relationship-name'.
Problem determination: If the incompletely defined tables were targets of the LOAD job, message DSNU305I has
been issued for each such table. Refer to the catalog to determine if any tables in the table space that were not targets
of the LOAD job are incompletely defined.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU308I csect-name INDEX KEY LIST RECORD LENGTH EXCEEDS MAXIMUM KEY BUFFER SIZE
Explanation: The length of the index key list that will be built in the Data Base Services address space while loading
a data record may be larger than the maximum key buffer size. The LOAD statement may be too complex.
System action: Utility processing is terminated.
User response: Examine the preceding DSNU650I INTO TABLE statements. The key size and number of indexes
affected by each INTO TABLE statement are accumulative. The combination of these elements may produce a list of
index keys, including header bytes, that is too large to be contained within the maximum size buffer area during the
load of each input data record. It may be necessary to reduce the number of INTO TABLE statements or to drop
some of the indexes that are affected by the load.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU309I csect-name NOT ALL REQUIRED UNIQUE INDEXES HAVE BEEN DEFINED FOR TABLE table-name
Explanation: The table 'table-name' was created with unique index requirements. Not all of these indexes have been
defined.
System action: Processing stops. No table in the table space is loaded.
User response: The user may resubmit the LOAD job after either:
v Creating all the required unique indexes, or
v Dropping the table and re-creating it without the unique index requirements.
Problem determination: Determine which unique indexes need to be created. Determine if the uniqueness
requirement for the table is valid.
Severity: 8
DSNU310I csect-name RECORD 'n' WILL BE DISCARDED DUE TO field-name CONVERSION ERROR FOR table-name ERROR CODE cc
Explanation: The load utility found the input data provided for a field to be incorrect. The corresponding input data
set record 'n' will be placed in the DISCARDS data set.
If the NOSUBS keyword was specified, it is possible that the record was discarded because the input contained a
code point that when converted from the source CCSID to the target CCSID resulted in a substitution character being
placed in the target string.
The error code, cc, identifies the problem. See DSNU334I for the list of error codes and their meaning.
System action: The input data set record is noted and is discarded in the DISCARD phase. The LOAD utility
continues to process additional records in the input data set.
User response: Following the completion of the current LOAD utility invocation, examine the record in the
DISCARDS data set. Correct the error in the discarded input data. Submit a RESUME(YES) LOAD invocation with
the DISCARDS data set as the input data set.

DSNU315I csect-name RECORD 'n' WILL BE DISCARDED DUE TO UNEXPECTED ERROR
Explanation: The LOAD of input data set record number nwas attempted but was not successful due to an
unexpected error.
System action: If the error was caused because a resource was not available, a DSNT500I message will be issued.
The utility step will be abended with a system X'04E' and an abend reason code of '00E40318'. If a DSNT500I
message is not issued, an SVC dump will be requested. A SYSABEND dump of batch storage is also requested.
Operator response: An operator with SYSOPR authority can issue a TERM UTIL to free any held resources if that is
necessary.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
User response: If a DSNT500I message was issued, refer to the description under that message number. If the
unavailable resource becomes available, the utility step is restartable.
If there is no DSNT500I message, the error is an unexpected internal error and you should consult your system

DSNU319I csect-name RESUME(YES) WAS SPECIFIED FOR EMPTY PARTITION nn. RESUME(NO) IS ASSUMED
Explanation: This message is issued in response to a LOAD utility request containing a partition level
RESUME(YES) option. The RESUME(YES) option implies that the specified partition 'nn' is populated, but in this
case it was not. The message alerts the invoker to this fact, and continues as if RESUME(YES) was not specified.
System action: The LOAD utility, in attempting to honor the RESUME(YES), found the partition was empty, ignored
the option, and continued as if RESUME(NO) was specified.
User response: The user is alerted to the fact that the requested partition was empty rather than populated as the
RESUME LOAD option implied.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU320I csect-name RESUME(YES) WAS SPECIFIED FOR AN EMPTY TABLESPACE
Explanation: RESUME(YES) was specified within the LOAD utility statement. However, the RESUME(YES) option
implies that the specified table space is populated.
System action: Processing continues. The LOAD utility, in attempting to honor the RESUME(YES), found the table
space empty, so ignored the option, and proceeded as if RESUME(NO) was specified. If this table is currently defined
as COMPRESS YES, a dictionary is not built, unless the tablespace is empty, in which case a compression dictionary
will be built.
User response: The user is alerted to the fact that the requested table space was empty rather than populated as the
RESUME LOAD option implied. Use the RESUME(NO) option if you want a compression dictionary built.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU321I csect-name CHECK PENDING ON TABLESPACE tablespace-name PROHIBITS PROCESSING
Explanation: The requested utility cannot be run against a tablespace or tablespace partition in a check pending
state.
System action: Processing terminates after the check pending states of all target tablespaces or partitions of the
utility are analyzed.
User response: Remove the named tablespace or partition from its check pending state by using the CHECK DATA
or REPAIR utility. If you want more information on the extent of questionable data in the table space, query the
SYSTABLES and SYSTABLEPART catalog tables.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU322I csect-name DEFERRED STATUS OF TABLE SPACE database-name.table-space-name PROHIBITS PROCESSING
Explanation: The requested utility cannot be run against a table space or table space partition in a deferred state.
System action: Processing terminates after the deferred state of all target table spaces or table space partitions of the
utility are analyzed.
User response: To remove the deferred state, use the RECOVER TABLESPACE, LOAD REPLACE utility, or -START
DATABASE command with ACCESS(RW) or ACCESS(RO). If you want more information on the status of the table
space, use the -DISPLAY DATABASE command.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU323I csect-name COLUMN ccc IS OMITTED
Explanation: The column 'ccc' is a nonnullable column and is not being loaded. Field specifications must include all
nonnullable columns. The identified column name was missing from the field specification.
System action: Further utility processing is terminated.
System programmer response: Corrective procedures may require that a table be dropped and created again.
User response: Determine if the input data contains the nonnullable column as a field. If it does, change the field
specification to include it. If the input data does not contain the nonnullable column as a field, determine which is in
error, the input data or the column specification. Make the corresponding correction. Resubmit the job if that is still
appropriate.

DSNU326I csect-name - USER NOT AUTHORIZED FOR LOAD REPLACE ON TABLESPACE
Explanation: The user attempted to use the REPLACE option of LOAD, and it will reset to empty all tables in the
table space before loading data. This option requires load authorization on each table in the table space, but the user
did not have authority for one or more tables. In addition, if a table in the table space has a security label column,
the user must have the write-down privilege when write-down is in effect.
System action: When LOAD REPLACE validation encounters the first non-authorized table in the table space, the
job step is terminated.
User response: Obtaining the LOAD on DATABASE privilege for the database will allow you to proceed using the
REPLACE option. If the table space is an implicit database, then obtain the appropriate authorization privileges on
the implicit database or DSNDB04. If a table in the table space has a security label column, ensure that the user has
write-down privilege when write-down is in effect before using the REPLACE option. The other alternative is to first
delete all rows from the tables which are to be loaded, and then use the RESUME option instead of the REPLACE
option.
Severity: 12 (severe error)

If the data is to be loaded into TABLE 'b', create another LOAD utility statement that contains the INTO TABLE
control statement for TABLE 'b' and resubmit the job.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU328I csect-name CANNOT PROCESS THE NON-EMPTY PARTITION nn WITH RESUME(NO).  PROCESSING TERMINATES
Explanation: The partition level RESUME keyword either specified or defaulted to a value of NO, which requires

System action: Further utility processing is terminated.
System programmer response: Determine whether the partition should be empty. If it should, use SQL DELETE to
empty it. Otherwise, instruct the user to use the RESUME(YES) option for that partition.
User response: Determine why the assumption of an empty partition was wrong. This may require consultation
with the system programmer. Either remove the current partition's rows using an SQL DELETE, or change the LOAD

Explanation: The LOAD utility found that the input field 'ffffffff' extends beyond the end of the input record.
If DISCARDS processing is active, the message severity is 4 (warning).
System action: For fixed length records, with no VARCHARs included, the length needed by the LOAD utility can
be calculated before processing. In this case, when the LOAD utility determines that no records can be loaded
because ALL of the INTO TABLE statements require input longer than the defined lengths, the LOAD job terminates
on the first record without discarding any records. Further utility processing with mixed or non-fixed length records
is terminated unless DISCARDS processing is active.
User response: Correct the input data and resubmit the job. Make sure that the 'field specification' on the LOAD

allowed is 32767 bytes.
System action: When discard processing is specified, the input data set logical record is noted and will be discarded
in the DISCARD phase. The LOAD utility continues to process additional records in the input data set, and the
severity level is 4. When discard process is not specified, the severity is 8 and the LOAD utility will terminate.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
User response: When discard processing is specified, following the completion of the current LOAD utility
invocation, examine the record in the DISCARDS data set. Correct the error in the discarded input data, and submit a
RESUME(YES) LOAD invocation with the DISCARDS data set as the input data set. When discard processing is not
specified: correct the error in the input data set and rerun the job.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
Severity: 8
DSNU338I csect-name INVALID COLUMN SPECIFICATION FOR column name
Explanation: The LOAD utility found the dynamically determined column location for an input field to be incorrect.
System action: The utility abends to allow restart.
User response: Correct the input field specification or the input data and restart the job. Alternatively, TERM the
utility.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU339I csect-name INVALID CONTINUEIF SPECIFICATION
Explanation: The CONTINUEIF clause of a LOAD utility extends beyond the end of the input record.
System action: The LOAD utility is terminated.
User response: Correct the CONTINUEIF clause. The column specification must be reduced and/or the value being
compared must be shortened. The value being compared must be entirely within the input record.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU340I csect-name - ERROR LOADING INDEX, DUPLICATE KEY, INDEX=index-name, TABLE=table-name, RID OF INDEXED ROW=indexed-row, RID OF NON-INDEXED ROW=nonindexed-row
Explanation: A duplicate key was found during the BUILD phase of REORG INDEX or REBUILD INDEX, or a
duplicate hash key was found during the BUILD phase of REORG INDEX. The duplicate key violates the uniqueness
rule for the index or the hash key.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
index-name
The name of the index.
table-name
The name of the table.
indexed-row
The record ID (RID) of the indexed row.
nonindexed-row
The record ID (RID) of the non-indexed row.
System action: All duplicate index entries of the indicated index are reported and the index is placed in RECOVERY
PENDING status. Duplicate rows are present in the indexed table.
Utility processing continues with any other utility functions within the utility job step.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Take steps to inhibit any further processing until the index is repaired. Applications
that are dependent upon the uniqueness of the table rows should not be initiated until corrective action has been
taken.
If the nonunique keys are correct, drop and re-create the index as nonunique.
If the records with duplicate keys should not be in the table, use the REPAIR utility with the DELETE option to
remove the incorrect rows. Use the RID values provided in the message as input to the REPAIR utility.
After the duplicate data rows are removed or the unique index has been dropped, issue the DISPLAY DATABASE
command with the RESTRICT option against the target database. Use the REBUILD INDEX utility to recover any
indexes that are in the REBUILD pending state. Optionally, use the CHECK INDEX utility to verify that the data and
indexes are consistent.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Use the REPAIR utility with LOCATE RID and DUMP statements to view the records with
duplicate keys.
The inconsistent index can cause SQLSELECT to fail. Use CHECK INDEX to check the validity of the index.

DSNU341I csect-name - IMAGE COPY MUST BE TAKEN BEFORE REORG CAN BE RUN ON A DB2 CATALOG OR DIRECTORY TABLE SPACE: database-name.tablespace-name
Explanation: The DB2 catalog or directory table space being reorganized does not have an image copy that the
RECOVER utility can use to recover the table space to currency. Before running the REORG utility, you must run the
COPY utility to create an image copy for the indicated table space. This action prevents having to recover the DB2
catalog or directory table space to a prior point in time if a problem occurs during REORG processing.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
database-name
The name of the directory or catalog database.
tablespace-name
The name of the directory or catalog table space.
System action: Processing terminates.
User response: Run the COPY utility to create an image copy of the DB2 catalog or directory table space. If more
than one catalog or directory table space is to be reorganized, consider using the QUIESCE and COPY utilities for the
set of table spaces to be reorganized.
Use the REPORT utility to view the recovery information related to the table space. The output from the REPORT
utility should indicate either the absence of an image copy, or the presence of a REORG LOG NO SYSCOPY record.

DSNU342I csect-name ERROR LOADING INDEX, ERROR = Xreason-code, INDEX = index-name
Explanation: The LOAD, REORG or REBUILD INDEX utility encountered a processing error, which it could not
correct, while extending the index identified by index-name.
System action: The building of index entries for the indicated index is not completed. An SVC dump of the
database services address space is requested for diagnostic purposes. The extension of other indexes associated with
the tables being loaded is attempted. Any subsequent attempt to use the index directly or indirectly will cause the
invoker to abend.
Operator response: The table space in question might need to be stopped and started for utility-only processing to
inhibit attempted application use of the defective index.
System programmer response: If the index is used by more than one application, applications that either insert
rows into, or delete rows from, the indexed table or use the index to access rows must be inhibited from executing.
One way to accomplish this is to place the table space in question under utility-only processing control by using the
START DATABASE and STOP DATABASE commands until the REBUILD INDEX utility is executed.
Alternatively, the index can be dropped. Application execution can then proceed, and the index can be created again
(unless the index was the partitioning index).
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: If the indexed table is used by more than one application, the system programmer should be
informed so that applications that insert rows into, or delete rows from, the table or use the index directly are
inhibited until corrective action is taken.
Normal corrective action would be to use the REBUILD INDEX utility option to reconstruct the index after the
processing problem identified by the reason code has been resolved. Alternatively, the index can be dropped and
then created again, unless the index in question is the partitioning index.

Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU345I csect-name UNIQUE INDEX KEY DUPLICATES KEY FROM INPUT DATASET RECORD iiii LOADED AT RID rrrr INDEX = index-name TABLE = table-name RECNO = recno RID = duprid
Explanation: Input data set record recno was loaded into table table-name at RID duprid, but it causes a unique index
violation for index index-name. It duplicates the key value of another record in the load job: the record loaded at RID
rrrr from input data set record iiii.
System action: Processing continues. Index entries are not created for either record. Both records will be deleted in a
subsequent phase of processing.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU346I csect-name RECORD(n), CONCATENATED SQL/DS RECORD IS TOO LARGE
Explanation: A LOAD utility was executing with FORMAT SQL/DS input data. Multiple spanned segments of the
input data were concatenated into one logical record for loading. The resultant concatenated record is too large to be
processed. The maximum length allowed is 32764 bytes.
System action: When discard processing is specified, the input data set logical record is noted and is discarded in
the DISCARD phase. The LOAD utility continues to process additional records in the input data set and the severity
is 4. When discard processing is not specified, the severity is 8 and the LOAD utility terminates.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
User response: When discard processing is specified, examine the records in the DISCARDS data set after the
LOAD utility completes. Correct the error in the discarded input data. Then run the LOAD utility with the RESUME
YES option using the DISCARDS data set as input. When discard processing is not specified, correct the error in the
input data set and rerun the job.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).

deadline that is specified in the DEADLINE option
In either case, this message is described as part of the DISPLAY UTILITY output in DSNU100I on page 611.
DSNU348I csect-name BUILD PHASE STATISTICS. NUMBER OF KEYS = nnnnnnnn FOR INDEX index-name PART part-num
Explanation: This message is issued by the BUILD phase of the REBUILD INDEX utility to report the total number
of index key entries used to build the indicated index partition.
System action: This message indicates the number of index key entries submitted to the DB2 data manager to build
the indicated index partition. Both unique and nonunique key entries are counted. Rejected key entries are not
counted.
User response: The user can verify that the number reported is consistent with expectations.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU349I csect-name BUILD PHASE STATISTICS. NUMBER OF KEYS = nnnnnnnn FOR index-name
Explanation: This message is issued by the BUILD phase of the LOAD, REORG or REBUILD INDEX utility. The
message is repeated for each index built by the LOAD, REORG or REBUILD INDEX utility. It indicates the total
number of index key entries used to build the indicated index.
System action: This message indicates the number of index key entries that were submitted to the DB2 data
manager to build the indicated index. Both unique and nonunique key entries are counted. Rejected key entries are
not counted.
User response: The user can verify that the number reported is consistent with expectations. For example, the user
can determine if it matches the number of records loaded for the table indexed by the indicated index.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU350I csect-name - EXISTING RECORDS DELETED FROM TABLESPACE

table space.
System action: Processing continues.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU351I csect-name - 'reorg-option' OPTION IS NOT APPLICABLE FOR A DB2 CATALOG OR DIRECTORY OBJECT. THE OPTION IS IGNORED.
Explanation: The identified option does not apply for this DB2 catalog or directory object. Table spaces and indexes
within the DB2 catalog and directory may be processed differently than other table spaces and indexes. Consequently,
these table spaces and indexes may not make use of reorg option reorg-option.
System action: The option is ignored and processing continues.
User response: None is required. However, you can remove the option from the utility input statement.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU352I EXISTING RECORDS DELETED FROM TABLESPACE PARTITION x
Explanation: A LOAD utility execution, in which PART 'x' REPLACE was specified, has deleted all data records
from partition 'x'. Index records over partition 'x' will be deleted in a subsequent phase of processing.
System action: Processing continues.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU353I csect-name RECORD 'n' WILL BE DISCARDED DUE TO CHECK CONSTRAINT constraint-name VIOLATION ON TABLE table-name
Explanation: The discarded record violates the check constraint named constraint-name defined on table table-name.
The record is not loaded and is discarded during the DISCARD phase.
System action: The LOAD utility continues to process additional records in the input data set.
User response: After the LOAD utility completes, examine the record in the DISCARDS data set. Correct the error
in the discarded input data. Submit a RESUME(YES) LOAD job with the DISCARDS data set as the input data set.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU354I csect-name RECORD 'n' VIOLATES CHECK CONSTRAINT constraint-name ON TABLE table-name
Explanation: The LOAD utility cannot load record n into table table-name because the check constraint
constraint-name would be violated. The record is not loaded.
System action: Processing terminates. An abend is requested so that the LOAD can be restarted after the error
condition is corrected.
User response: Find the failing record in the input data set, correct the condition that caused the check constraint to
be violated, and restart the LOAD utility. You can optionally include a SYSDISC DD statement in the JCL input to
hold copies of records that are not loaded.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU355I csect-name INDEXVAL PHASE STATISTICS - error-count DUPLICATE KEY ERRORS, KEY EVALUATION ERRORS, XML ERRORS OR LOB ERRORS WERE CORRECTED BY DELETING deleted-count DATA ROWS
Explanation: This message reports the results of the INDEXVAL phase of the LOAD utility. Data rows that were
added during the LOAD or RELOAD phase of this LOAD utility invocation were deleted because the data rows
caused one of the following conditions:
v Unique index violations in the BUILD phase
v Key evaluation errors during the build of an index on an expression-based index
v XML document errors or LOB errors in the BUILD phase
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
error-count
The number of unique index violations or key evaluation errors.
deleted-count
The number of data rows that were deleted to correct the errors.
Unique index violations are counted in one of two ways. An input data set record which has a value for a uniquely
indexed column that duplicates a value that existed in the index prior to the LOAD job is counted as one duplicate
key error. Two input data set records which have like values for a uniquely indexed column are counted as two
unique index errors (that is, each of the two input data set records is in error).
System action: Processing continues.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
User response: Examine the error summary from the LOAD job. Determine which of the discarded records need to
be corrected and loaded into the table space.
Compare the number of duplicate key errors or key evaluation errors that were corrected in the INDEXVAL phase to
the number of duplicate key errors that were detected in the BUILD phase (reported by message DSNU343I).
If the counts are unequal, notify the system programmer.
If the counts are equal, following the LOAD utility execution, examine the discards file or the LOAD error summary
to determine which input data set records caused the unique index violations or key evaluation errors. Revise the
input records so they will not introduce duplicate values into unique indexes and reapply the input records to the
table space. Alternatively, if appropriate, make the index non-unique and reapply the rejected records that caused the
duplicate key errors to the table space.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.

DSNU357I csect-name - 'LOG NO' OPTION REQUIRED FOR DB2 CATALOG AND DIRECTORY TABLE SPACES
Explanation: The LOG NO option must be specified when reorganizing a DB2 catalog or directory table space.
System action: Processing terminates.
User response: Add the LOG NO option to the utility input statement.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU358I csect-name - 'UNLOAD ONLY' OPTION NOT VALID FOR DB2 CATALOG OR DIRECTORY TABLE SPACE
Explanation: The UNLOAD ONLY option is not permitted for DB2 catalog or directory table spaces.
System action: Processing terminates.
User response: Determine the purpose for using the UNLOAD ONLY option. There might be alternative ways of
accomplishing the required function (for example, the UNLOAD PAUSE option).
Severity: 8
DSNU359I KEYWORD 'SORTKEYS' SPECIFIED BUT NO INDEX OR FOREIGN KEYS EXIST, KEYWORD IS IGNORED
Explanation: The 'SORTKEYS' keyword was specified for a LOAD or REORG utility job; however, it was found that
no index and no foreign keys were defined for any of the tables being loaded or reorganized. The keyword is ignored
and processing continues normally.
System action: Processing continues normally.
User response: If an index or foreign keys were expected to be found for the table or tables being loaded or
reorganized, determine the reason the index or foreign keys could not be found.
Problem determination: Probably a user error. Determine if an index should be defined on any of the tables in the
table space, or if foreign keys should be defined. If so, define the index or foreign keys; otherwise, remove the
'SORTKEYS' keyword from the utility statement if necessary.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU360I csect-name - IN REORG WITH SHRLEVEL REFERENCE OR CHANGE, DATA SET name EXISTS, CONTEXT=c
Explanation: For the area (table space or partition) being reorganized, REORG with SHRLEVEL REFERENCE or
CHANGE unloads data from the original data sets and reloads data into shadow data sets. REORG then exchanges
the names of the original and shadow data sets, using temporary names during the renaming. The original name of a
data set is in the form catname.DSNDBx.dbname.psname.I0001.Annn. The shadow name of a data set is in the form
catname.DSNDBx.dbname.psname.J0001.Annn. The temporary name of a data set is in the form
catname.DSNDBx.dbname.psname.T0001.Annn. REORG uses such data sets for indexes as well as data.
During its initialization, REORG cannot execute if:
v Data sets with the temporary names already exist.
v DB2-managed data sets with the shadow names already exist.
v User-managed data sets with the shadow names do not already exist.
To exchange the names of the original and shadow data sets, REORG performs the following renaming:
1 In the switch phase, it renames the original data set from the original name to the temporary name
2 In the switch phase, it renames the shadow data set from the shadow name to the original name
3 In the utilterm phase, it renames the original data set from the temporary name to the shadow name (for
user-managed data sets). It deletes the temporary for DB2-managed data sets.
If a -TERM UTILITY command is issued after any renaming, or a restart of the REORG switch phase occurs after any
renaming, the data set names revert back to their original form prior to the renaming:
4 The original data set from the shadow name to the temporary name
5 The shadow data set from the original name to the shadow name
6 The original data set from the temporary name to the original name
The context code indicates the specific type of error:
1 During the switch phase of REORG, on rename 1, REORG detected that a data set with a temporary name
already exists. This error condition can arise for a DB2-managed or user-managed data set.
2 During the switch phase of REORG, on rename 2, REORG detected that a data set with a original name
already exists. This error condition can arise for a DB2-managed or user-managed data set.
3 During the utilterm phase of REORG, on rename 3, REORG detected that a data set with a shadow name
already exists. This error condition can arise for a user-managed data set.
4 During switch phase restart or a -TERM UTILITY during the switch phase, on rename 4 (while reverting
back to the original name), -TERM UTILITY detected that a data set with a temporary name already exists.
This error condition can arise for a DB2-managed or user-managed data set.
5 During switch phase restart or a -TERM UTILITY during the switch phase, on rename 5 (while reverting
back to the original name), -TERM UTILITY detected that a data set with a shadow name already exists.
This error condition can arise for a DB2-managed or user-managed data set.
6 During switch phase restart or a -TERM UTILITY during the switch phase, on rename 6 (while reverting
back to the original name), -TERM UTILITY detected that a data set with a original name already exists.
This error condition can arise for a DB2-managed or user-managed data set.
8 During initialization of REORG, REORG detected that a data set with a temporary name already exists. This
error condition can arise for a DB2-managed or user-managed data set.
System action: For context code 1, or 2, the utility job step that caused the function to be requested abends with
code 00E4031B. The utility job is placed in the stopped state.
For context code 3, the utility job step that caused the function to be requested continues without performing this
renaming.
For context code 4, 5, or 6, the object is left in a recovery pending state, -TERM UTILITY continues to undo
renaming, and a message is issued. The objects and messages are as follows:
v If the data set is part of a nonpartitioned table space, the object is the table space, and the message is DSNU562I.
v If the data set is part of a partition of a table space, the object is the partition, and the message is DSNU560I.
v If the data set is part of a nonpartitioned index, the object is the index, and the message is DSNU557I.
v If the data set is part of a partition of a partitioned index, the object is the partition of the index, and the message
is DSNU559I.
For context code 8, REORG does not execute.
User response: For context code 1 or 2, you can choose between these actions:
v Delete the data set; then RESTART the utility.
v TERM the utility. Delete the data set before trying to execute REORG again with SHRLEVEL REFERENCE or
CHANGE.
For context code 3, if you want to perform the renaming, delete the data set with the shadow name and then
perform the renaming.
For context code 4, 5, or 6, execute the RECOVER or REBUILD INDEX utility; then delete the shadow and temporary
data sets (if they still exist).
For context code 8, delete the data set and then execute REORG.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU361I csect-name FOREIGN KEY HAS NO PRIMARY KEY FOR RELATIONSHIP=r1 INPUT RECORD NUMBER=nnnn, RID=Xrrrr
Explanation: Input record nnnn caused a row to be loaded into table table at RID rrrr with no primary key for the

System action: Processing continues.
User response: None required. The constraint violation described will be rectified later in processing.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU362I csect-name - IN utility WITH SHRLEVEL CHANGE, LOG HAS BECOME SHORT, BUT MAXRO IS DEFER, MEMBER=member-name, UTILID=utilid
Explanation: When you execute utility with SHRLEVEL CHANGE, DB2 will add a five second pause to the next
iteration, if the value of MAXRO is DEFER, and the actual time for an iteration and the estimated time for the next
iteration are both less than five seconds. This pause limits the utility's consumption of processor time.
Within an execution of the utility, the first time that this situation occurs, DB2 produces this message, which
announces the pause. On all later occurrences of this situation, DB2 still adds the pause, but DB2 sends the message
only if DB2 has not sent the message (for this execution of the utility) within the past 30 minutes.
WTO This message is sent to the console, but it is not an action message. It is not sent to SYSPRINT.
member-name
In a data sharing environment, member-name identifies the DB2 member. In a non-sharing environment,
member-name is blank. The variable of utilid identifies the utility job step.
System action: The utility continues execution, with a five second pause. If the conditions in the explanation above
continue to be true, DB2 continues to add five second pauses.
Operator response: You are not required to take any action at this time, but if you were planning to wait for an
appropriate time to execute the -ALTER UTILITY command to increase the value of MAXRO and thus cause the
utility to finish, now might be an appropriate time to execute.
User response: You are not required to take any action at this time, but if you were planning to wait for an
appropriate time to execute the -ALTER UTILITY command to choose the value of MAXRO, and thus cause REORG
to finish, now might be an appropriate time to execute.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU363I csect-name - ENFORCE PHASE STATISTICS - RELATIONSHIP r1 FOREIGN KEYS CHECKED=n CONSTRAINT VIOLATIONS ENCOUNTERED=m

System action: Processing continues.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU364I csect-name PARTITIONS WILL BE LOADED IN PARALLEL, NUMBER OF TASKS = nnnn
Explanation: This message is issued by the RELOAD phase of the LOAD utility. The message indicates that the
LOAD utility is able to load partitions in parallel. The number of utility tasks used to load partitions is indicated by
nnnn.
System action: Processing of the RELOAD phase continues.
User response: You can verify that the number of tasks reported is consistent with your expectations. For example,
if 4 partitions are to be loaded, you might expect to see the number of tasks = 4.
Severity: 0
DSNU365I csect-name - USER auth-id DOES NOT HAVE AUTHORITY ON REORG MAPPING TABLE
Explanation: The REORG utility was run with SHRLEVEL CHANGE and a mapping table, but user auth-id does not
have authority to delete, insert, select, and update in the mapping table specified in the utility statement.
System action: Further utility processing is terminated.
User response: Obtain authorization to delete, insert, select, and update in the mapping table specified in the utility
statement.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU366I csect-name - REORG MAPPING TABLE HAS WRONG COLUMNS
Explanation: A mapping table was specified for a utility job executing REORG with SHRLEVEL CHANGE.
However, the table has the wrong set of columns. This message results from any CREATE table parameters that are
missing from, added to or different than the CREATE TABLE statement for the mapping table.
System action: REORG does not execute.
User response: Correct the table columns in the mapping table, and run the REORG utility again.

DSNU367I csect-name - ENFORCE PHASE STATISTICS - n ROWS DELETED FROM TABLE t
Explanation: This message reports the results of the ENFORCE phase of the LOAD utility. Data rows added during
the RELOAD phase of the LOAD utility have been deleted because they contained foreign keys which did not have a
corresponding primary key. A total of n data rows were deleted from table t.
Primary errors may cascade and remove additional records. The count is the sum of both primary and secondary
constraint violations.
System action: Processing continues.
User response: Determine why no primary key exists for the deleted record.
Problem determination: All primary errors are accompanied by a DSNU361I message which identifies the
relationship and input record which does not have a primary key value. The report phase will report all secondary
errors and indicate the primary error record which caused this record to be deleted.
The relevant parent table can be found by querying the SYSIBM.SYSRELS catalog table. The relevant columns can be
found by querying the SYSIBM.SYSFOREIGNKEYS catalog table.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU368I csect-name - REORG MAPPING TABLE HAS WRONG INDEX
Explanation: A mapping table was specified for a REORG utility job that specifies SHRLEVEL CHANGE. However,
the table contains the wrong index. This message might result from any CREATE INDEX parameters that are missing
from, added to, or different from the CREATE INDEX statement in the mapping table. It might also result from the
existence of any other indexes on the mapping table.
System action: The REORG utility does not execute.
User response: Create a mapping table with the correct index and no other indexes, and run the REORG utility.

Explanation: The utility has terminated.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
utility-name
The name of the utility.
reason-code
A numeric value that indicates the reason for the failure.
1 The utility with SHRLEVEL CHANGE specified LONGLOG TERM, and at the end of an iteration
of log processing, the number of log records that the next iteration would process is not sufficiently
lower than the number that the previous iterations processed.
2 DB2 estimated that the switch phase of REORG with SHRLEVEL REFERENCE or CHANGE would
not start by the deadline specified in the DEADLINE phrase.
3 REORG terminated because the FlashCopy? failed and no inline copy was made.
System action: The utility terminates.
User response: Take the action that corresponds to the reason-code value:
1 Attempt a new invocation of the utility later, perhaps when you expect that the application workload is
lower or the maximum needed amount of time for applications to have read-only access is longer.
2
v On SHRLEVEL CHANGE, attempt a new invocation of reorganization later, perhaps when you expect to
have a longer time available, you expect that the application workload is lower, or you expect that the
maximum needed amount of time for applications to have read-only access is longer.
v On SHRLEVEL REFERENCE, attempt a new invocation of reorganization later, perhaps when you expect
to have more time available.
3 Correct the problem with FlashCopy and run the utility again.

DSNU377I csect-name - IN utility WITH SHRLEVEL CHANGE, THE LOG IS BECOMING LONG, MEMBER=member-name, UTILID=utilid
Explanation: During log processing for REORG with SHRLEVEL CHANGE, the number of log records that the next
iteration will process is not sufficiently lower than the number that the previous iterations processed. This situation
means that during reorganization, the log is not being read quickly enough to catch up to the application writing the
log. This is a WTO message; it is sent to the console, but it is not an action message. It is also sent to SYSPRINT.
During log processing for utility with SHRLEVEL CHANGE, the number of log records that the next iteration is to
process is not sufficiently lower than the number that the previous iterations processed. When you executed the
utility, the log was not read quickly enough to catch up to the application that is writing the log. This is a WTO
message; it is sent to the console, but it is does not require any user action. The message is also sent to SYSPRINT.
DB2 refrains from taking the specified action in the LONGLOG phrase if any one of the following events occur for
this execution of the utility before the delay expires:
v You issue an -ALTER UTILITY command.
v You issue a -TERM UTILITY command.
v DB2 estimates that the time to perform the next iteration is less than or equal to the time specified in the MAXRO
phrase.
v The utility terminates for any reason (including the deadline).
member-name
Identifies the DB2 member in a data sharing environment. It is blank in a non-data-sharing environment.
utilid Identifies the utility job step.
System action: After a delay (specified by the DELAY phrase of the utility or the -ALTER UTILITY command), the
REORG utility performs the action specified by the LONGLOG phrase of the REORG utility or the -ALTER UTILITY
command.
Operator response: No action is required. However, if the action that is specified by the LONGLOG phrase is not
what you wanted, the operator (or a user-written program that is triggered by the message) can take an action.

DSNU397I csect-name NUMBER OF TASKS CONSTRAINED BY resource-type
Explanation: This message indicates that while a utility is able to start subtasks to perform operations in parallel,
the number of tasks that it will use has been constrained by a lack of some resource.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
resource-type
The constraining resource, which can have the following values and meanings:
VIRTUAL STORAGE
The utility could start additional tasks, but there is insufficient virtual storage in the address space
in which the utility job is running to make it effective to do so.
VIRTUAL STORAGE BELOW
The utility could start additional tasks, but there is insufficient virtual storage below the line in the
address space in which the utility job is running to make it effective to do so.
DD STATEMENTS
The utility could start additional tasks, but the user has specified DD statements for the data sets to
be used by SORT for sort work data sets or for sort message data sets, and fewer sort work data set
groups or sort message data sets have been specified than the maximum number of tasks the utility
could otherwise start.
CPUS The utility could start additional tasks, but it would not be efficient to do so because it would
overtax the available CPUs.
SWA=BELOW
The utility could start additional tasks, but there is insufficient storage below the line in the address
space in which the job is running.
System action: Processing of the phase continues.
User response: No action is required. However, if you want to increase the number of tasks used by the utility in
order to reduce the elapsed time of the utility job, the possible actions depend on the value of resource-type in the
message:
VIRTUAL STORAGE
Increase the amount of virtual storage available to the utility job by specifying a larger region size in the job
JCL, altering the JES defaults for region size, or changing the system IEFUSI exit to allow a larger virtual
region.
If the utility is using BSAM data sets for which the number of buffers have been specified (BUFNO specified
in the DCB field of the DD statement for the data set), consider reducing the number of buffers.
VIRTUAL STORAGE BELOW
If possible, increase the amount of virtual storage below the line available to the utility job by specifying a
larger region size in the job JCL or reducing the number of data sets allocated in the job step. It might not be
possible to relieve this constraint.
DD STATEMENTS
Define additional groups of sort work data sets, or eliminate the SWnnWKmm DD statements and specify
the SORTDEVT keyword (and, optionally, the SORTNUM keyword) to allow SORT to use dynamic
allocation of its work data sets.
If the limitation is due to sort message data sets rather than sort work data sets, define additional sort
message DD statements or eliminate the UTPRINnn DD statements and allocate UTPRINT to SYSOUT so
that the sort message data sets can be dynamically allocated.
CPUS Submit the job to a member that has more processors.
SWA=BELOW
Move the SWA above the 16 MB line for the JOBCLASS. JES command, $DJOBCLASS(n), will display
whether or not SWA is set to BELOW for CLASS n. The $TJOBCLASS(n),SWA=ABOVE command will set
SWA to ABOVE the line. The $DSTCCLASS and $TSTCCLASS commands can be used to move SWA to
ABOVE for the utilities that are running in a WLM Stored Procedure Environment. Consult with the MVS
System Programmer on these changes.

The utility step is abended with a system X'04E' with an abend reason code of '00E40318'. If a DSNT500I message is
not issued, an SVC dump is requested. A SYSABEND dump of batch storage is also requested.
The utility step is left in the stopped state.
Operator response: An operator with SYSOPR authority can issue a TERM UTIL to free any held resources (this
may not be necessary).
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
User response: If a DSNT500I message was issued, refer to its description under that message number in this
manual. If the unavailable resource becomes available, the utility step is restartable.
If a DSNT500I message is not issued, the error is an internal error. Notify the system programmer.

DSNU400I csect-name COPY PROCESSED FOR object-type object-qualifier.object-name NUMBER OF PAGES=total-pages AVERAGE PERCENT FREE SPACE PER PAGE = free-space PERCENT OF CHANGED PAGES = changed-pages ELAPSED TIME= hh:mm:ss
Explanation: This is an informational message to report the copy statistics. This message is issued by the following
utilities:
v COPY
v LOAD, if a full image copy has been requested during a table space load
v REORG, if a full image copy has been requested during a table space reorganization
The statistics apply to pages that are included in the scope of the COPY request: a full table space, a full index space
(DSNUM(ALL)), or a partition (DSNUM(integer)). All of the pages in the table space, index space, or partition can be
copied (FULL(YES)), or only the changed pages can be copied (FULL(NO)).
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
object-type
The type of object.
object-qualifier.object-name
The name of the object, as a qualified name.
total-pages
The number of pages written out. The number of pages written includes valid instances where pages are
written more than once, or for incremental copies, pages written which have not changed since the last copy
was taken. A slight discrepancy between this value and the actual number of pages is possible and is
considered normal.
free-space
The average percentage of free space within the copied pages, in the format nn.nn. This value indicates the
amount of change activity that can occur without significant impairment of reference performance.
This value is 0 for sequential copies made from a FlashCopy.
changed-pages
The percentage of changed pages, to two decimal places (nn.nn or 100.00). This value indicates the amount
of change activity that occurred since the last image copy or reorganization. The percentage of changed
pages is obtained by dividing the number of changed pages by the number of pages in the object.
Preformatted pages consisting of all zeros are included in the count of pages scanned. Because these
preformatted pages are not copied to the output data set, the number of pages scanned is usually larger
than the number of pages copied.
When this message is issued for image copies produced during LOAD or REORG, this percentage will
always be reported as 100.00 (100%), because the utility is resetting and reformatting the entire table space.
This value is 0 for sequential copies made from a FlashCopy.
hh:mm:ss
The elapsed time, shown as the number of hours, minutes, and seconds.
System action: The COPY, LOAD or REORG utility continues processing. Message DSNU428I is issued when the
copy processing is complete.
User response: No action is required.
You can use this information to help you make decisions about your strategies, such as:

DSNU403I csect-name - FULL AND INCREMENTAL COPIES OF THE SAME TABLESPACE ON THE SAME TAPE DISALLOWED DDNAME ddname
Explanation: The COPY utility has been invoked to take an incremental image copy of a TABLESPACE. The
specified output data set is on a tape which contains another FULL or INCREMENTAL image copy of the same
TABLESPACE. This is not allowed.
System action: The utility will terminate with a return code of 8, and will not take the image copy or update the
SYSCOPY table.
User response: Change the VOLSER for the image copy output data set or use the MODIFY RECOVERY utility to
delete SYSIBM.SYSCOPY records which are no longer needed for the same TABLESPACE and tape volume.
Problem determination: Use the SQL SELECT command to look at the SYSIBM.SYSCOPY table. If the conflicting
image copy data sets on the output tape are no longer needed, use MODIFY RECOVERY to eliminate the related
SYSIBM.SYSCOPY records. If the data sets are still needed, you must place the new image copy on a different tape or
you must take a FULL image copy.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU404I csect-name LOCAL SITE AND RECOVERY SITE INCREMENTAL IMAGE COPIES ARE NOT SYNCHRONIZED FOR obj-type obj-qual.obj-name
Explanation: No incremental image copy can be made if
1. The incremental image copy is requested only for a site other than the current site.
2. The incremental image copies are requested for both sites but the most recent full image copy was made only for
the current site.
3. The incremental image copies are requested for both sites and the most recent full image copies were made for
both sites, but between the most recent full image copy and current request, all incremental image copies were
made for current site only.
System action: The utility will terminate with a return code of 8, and will not take the image copy or update the
SYSCOPY table.
User response: Take another full image copy of the TABLESPACE for both LOCAL site and RECOVERY site or
change the request to make incremental image copy only for current site.
Severity: 8(error)
DSNU406I FULL IMAGE COPY SHOULD BE TAKEN FOR BOTH LOCAL SITE AND RECOVERY SITE FOR obj-type obj-qual.obj-name
Explanation: The requested full image is for one site only but history shows that there were image copies taken for
both local site and recovery site and the table space is in copy pending status, or point in time recover has been done
on the table space, or the table space is in copy pending status and the requested full image copy is for a site other
than the current site. Be aware of the following situations:
1. If the requested copy is made for current site, then the other site can only do point in time recovery.
2. If the requested copy is for the site other than the current site, then the TABLESPACE will be in the same state as
before COPY has been made.
System action: COPY, LOAD, or REORG utility will continue to process the image copy.
User response: Take another full image copy of the TABLESPACE for both LOCAL site and RECOVERY site to
guarantee the correct recovery on both sites or check DSNZPARM to ensure that the current site is the site at which
the image copy is being taken.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU407I csect-name - DATA SET ALREADY USED FOR PREVIOUS IMAGE COPY DDNAME ddname
Explanation: A COPY, LOAD, or REORG utility has been invoked to take an image copy to a data set which is a
duplicate of one already recorded in SYSCOPY. If the specified data set is cataloged, a matching DSNAME exists. If
the specified data set is not cataloged, a matching DSNAME, DSVOLSER, and FILESEQNO exists.
System action: The utility will terminate with a return code of 8, and will not take the image copy or update the
SYSCOPY table.
User response: Change the name of the data set or use MODIFY utility to delete the old SYSCOPY record
containing the duplicate data set.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU408I csect-name - dsn EXISTS WITH -VOLUME=vol, FILE SEQUENCE-NUMBER=fseq, RBA=rba|lrsn, DATE=date, TIME=time
Explanation: If this message is issued after DSNU403I, it provides information from the SYSCOPY catalog table
about the previously created image copy of the table space. If this message is issued after DSNU407I, it provides
information from the SYSCOPY table about the duplicate data set that was detected during image copy processing.
For copies to DASD or MSS, fseq is 0; for copies of cataloged data sets, vol is (CATG).
System action: The utility terminates with return code 8 and does not take the image copy or update the SYSCOPY
table.
User response: Use the information provided to change the name of the data set or to locate the duplicate
SYSCOPY record for deletion with the MODIFY RECOVERY utility.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU409I csect-name NO hardware-or-software SUPPORT FOR obj-type obj-qual.obj-name
Explanation: This message is issued by the COPY or RECOVER utility for one of the following reasons.
v The COPY utility was invoked to take a DFSMS concurrent copy of a table space or index space that resides on a
device with no hardware or software support for the DFSMSdss DUMP command with the CONCURRENT
option.
v The RECOVER utility invoked the DFSMSdss RESTORE command without the supporting software.
System action: The RECOVER utility falls back to the previous image copy data set and continues. The COPY
utility job terminates.
User response: If a list of objects is specified in the COPY job, remove the object that has no hardware or software
support from the list. Resubmit the job or use the DB2 COPY utility instead of the DFSMS Concurrent Copy utility.
Severity: 4 (for RECOVER) or 8 (for COPY)
DSNU410I csect-name obj-type obj-qual.obj-name CONTAINED NO CHANGED PAGES
Explanation: An incremental image copy (COPY option FULL(NO)), which copies only changed pages, was
requested. However, no changed pages were found.
System action: This message indicates normal completion of the image copy utility. Processing continues to the next
utility statement in the utility job step, if any. If there are no more utility statements, the utility job step is normally
terminated, and the resources are released to their prior availability state. The UTILID of the utility job step becomes
available for reuse.
Because no output was produced, the SYSIBM.SYSCOPY catalog table remains unchanged.
The requester may want to determine why the apparent assumption that a change occurred was not true.
Operator response: The target copy data set identified by the DD statement nominated by the COPY COPYDDN
option was not required. It was not tracked in the DB2 catalog table SYSIBM.SYSCOPY. It need not be kept for
subsequent re-call.
Severity: 4 (warning)
This message reflects a warning condition that did not prevent subsequent processing.

normally with message DSNU401I.
User response: No action is required.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU414I csect-name UNABLE TO RETRIEVE RESTART/REDO LRSN obj-type obj-qual.obj-name
Explanation: This message is issued by the DB2 COPY utility when an error is encountered during the retrieval of a
log record sequence number (LRSN).
This error can occur in these situations:
v Another DB2 in a data sharing group terminated abnormally while trying to update the table space or index space.
v A failure occurred while trying to communicate with other DB2s in the data sharing group.
System action: The utility job terminates.
User response: Issue a -DISPLAY DATABASE command with the USE option to determine if any other DB2 systems
hold a retained lock on the table space or index space (status = RSTRT). If so, you must restart that DB2 system
before the COPY job can be successfully run.

DSNU425I csect-name obj-type obj-qual.obj-name DOES NOT HAVE THE COPY YES ATTRIBUTE
Explanation: The utility cannot process the identified index or index space because it was not defined with the
COPY YES attribute. Without the COPY YES attribute, the index cannot be specified as a target for the RECOVER,
COPY, or REPORT utilities. If the index needs to be rebuilt from the data in the table space, use the REBUILD INDEX
utility instead.
System action: The RECOVER utility terminates processing with a return code of 8. The COPY utility skips this
object but continues processing the other objects in the list. The final COPY utility return code will be 8. The REPORT
utility issues this message with a return code of 4 and continues processing other objects (if any).
User response: Determine whether the index should be altered to have the COPY YES attribute. If so, alter the index
then rerun the utility job. Otherwise remove the index from the utility statement.
Severity: 4 (warning) or 8 (error)
DSNU426I csect-name CANNOT COPY ONE PIECE OF NON-PARTITIONING obj-type obj-qual.obj-name

DSNU447I csect-name - COPY SHRLEVEL CHANGE OF obj-type obj-qual.obj-name IS NOT ALLOWED BECAUSE IT HAS A LOGGING ATTRIBUTE OF NOT LOGGED
Explanation: COPY with SHRLEVEL CHANGE was specified for a COPY utility job that refers to an object with a
NOT LOGGED logging attribute. This situation is not supported.
System action: Utility processing halts for this object. The utility job completes with a return code of 8.
If the utility job step include an OPTIONS control statement with the EVENT(ITEMERROR,SKIP) option, the utility
will process the next item in the list.
User response: Remove the SHRLEVEL CHANGE option from the utility control statement.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU448I csect-name - SCOPE PENDING WAS SPECIFIED, BUT NO OBJECT WITH PENDING STATUS WAS FOUND
Explanation: SCOPE PENDING was specified for the utility job, however no objects existed in the list with a

Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU449I csect-name - THE NOT LOGGED INDEX obj-qual.obj-name IN ICOPY PENDING STATE MUST BE COPIED WITH ITS TABLE SPACE IN THE SAME COPY INVOCATION
Explanation: A NOT LOGGED index that is in ICOPY pending state must be copied together with its table space in
the same COPY invocation. An image copy of such an index made without its table space cannot be used for
recovery of the index to a point consistent with its table space because the recovery would require applying log
records, which were not written. Therefore, such an image copy is not allowed.
System action: Utility processing halts for this object. The utility job completes with a return code of 8.
If the utility job step includes an OPTIONS control statement with the EVENT(ITEMERROR,SKIP) option, the utility
will process the next item in the list.
User response: Include the index's table space in the COPY list.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU454I csect-name COPY MERGE COMPLETE. NUMBER OF COPIES = iiiii, NUMBER OF COPIES MERGED = cccccc, TOTAL NUMBER OF PAGES MERGED = ttttt, ELAPSED TIME = hh/mm/ss
Explanation: This message marks the normal completion of the MERGECOPY utility. The variables are:
iiiii The number of copies found.
cccccc The number of image copies that were merged. The number merged can be less than the number found if a
work data set was not specified using the MERGECOPY WORKDDN option.
ttttt The total number of pages that were merged.
The merged incremental copies were consolidated either into a single new incremental image copy or into a new full
image copy, depending upon the MERGECOPY NEWCOPY option. The DB2 catalog table SYSIBM.SYSCOPY was
updated to reflect the results.
This message may indicate that prior data set entries were deleted and, consequently, that backup data set resources
were freed.
System action: Processing continues to the next utility statement in the utility job step, if any. If there are no more
utility statements, the utility job step is normally terminated, and the resources are released to their prior availability
state. The UTILID of the utility job step becomes available for reuse.
User response: You can review the reported statistics to assess the effectiveness of performing incremental image
copies. You can examine the SYSIBM.SYSCOPY catalog table to review the incremental and full image copies that are
subject to DB2 recovery.
The full or incremental image copy data set identified by the DD statement specified in the COPYDDN option was
recorded in SYSIBM.SYSCOPY. DB2 assumes that the image copy data set is now available for subsequent recovery.
Ensure that the data set is available for recovery.
Severity: 0/4 (informational/warning)
DSNU458I csect-name NO IMAGE COPIES TO MERGE
Explanation: This message is issued in response to a MERGECOPY request. The MERGECOPY utility was invoked
to merge existing incremental image copies. However, in checking the DB2 catalog table SYSIBM.SYSCOPY, no
incremental image copies were found.
System action: This message indicates the completion of the MERGECOPY utility. Processing continues to the next
utility statement in the utility job step, if any. If there are no more utility statements, the utility job step is normally
terminated, and the resources that were held become available for REFERENCE processing. The UTILID of the utility
job step becomes available for reuse.
The requester may want to determine why the assumption that incremental copies existed was not true.
Operator response: The target copy data set identified by the DD statement nominated by the MERGECOPY
COPYDDN option was not required. It was not tracked in the DB2 catalog table SYSIBM.SYSCOPY. It need not be
kept for subsequent re-call.
Severity: 4 (warning)
A severity 4 condition is given to alert the invoker that processing did not proceed as defined. However, processing
is proceeding; nothing was encountered that would invalidate further processing.
DSNU459I SYSCOPY P RECORD ENCOUNTERED FOR object-type object-qual.object-name, PIT RBA = xxxxxx
Explanation: The utility encountered a SYSCOPY record that contains a 'P' value in the ICTYPE column. This value
requires that the SYSCOPY record at the given RBA or LRSN be used.
System action: The utility properly traverses the SYSCOPY records following this SYSCOPY P record.
User response: No action is required.

DSNU460I csect-name IMAGE COPIES INCONSISTENT. MERGECOPY REQUEST REJECTED
Explanation: MERGECOPY was requested for an entire table space. However, the most recent image copy for the
associated table space was on the data set level. In addition, if the associated table space was partitioned, this might
indicate that any or all of its partitions were being reorganized or loaded without logging after the MERGECOPY
starting point. The MERGECOPY starting point is the most recent full image copy for the entire table space.
System action: This message indicates the completion of the MERGECOPY utility. Processing continues to the next
utility statement in the utility job step, if any. If there are no more utility statements, the utility job step is normally
terminated, and the resources that were held become available for REFERENCE processing. The UTILID of the utility
job step becomes available for reuse.
No output was produced and the SYSIBM.SYSCOPY catalog table remains unchanged.
User response: A full image copy of the associated table space should be taken. However, if it is preferred that a
recovery be done on the data set level, a MERGECOPY job should be submitted by specifying 'DSNUM(data set
number)' for each data set for which MERGECOPY is required.
Severity: 4 (warning)
A severity 4 condition is given to alert the user that processing did not proceed as defined. However, processing is
proceeding; nothing was encountered that would invalidate further processing.
DSNU461I csect-name PRIMARY FULL COPY DATA SET NOT FOUND, BACKUP WILL BE USED INSTEAD
Explanation: The primary full image copy cannot be found. The backup full image copy will be located and used
for the merge process.
User response: If the MERGECOPY utility can use the backup full image copy, the utility continues to process. If no
backup full image copy can be used, the utility terminates.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU462I csect-name MERGECOPY DISALLOWED FOR REQUESTED TABLE SPACE
Explanation: The MERGECOPY utility was requested for table space DSNDB01.DB01, DSNDB01.SYSUTILX, DSNDB06.SYSCOPY, or DSNDB01.SYSDBDXA.
MERGECOPY is not permitted, because only full image copies are allowed on these table spaces that are maintained
by DB2. Also, no record of the full image copies exists in the SYSIBM.SYSCOPY catalog table; the copy information is
in the DB2 log.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
System action: Further utility processing is terminated.
System programmer response: No action is required.
You do not need to merge copies for these table spaces, because no incremental image copies exist.

DSNU502I csect-name PAGE page number WAS NOT FOUND IN ANY IMAGE COPY DATA SET
Explanation: The page specified for 'RECOVER page' was not found in any image copy data sets.
This is an informational message only. It does not indicate termination of processing.
System action: The RECOVER utility continues processing. The assumption is that the page was inserted after the
last image copy was made. The page is reset and recovered from the log, starting at the log RBA recorded in the
SYSCOPY record for the last image copy data set.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU503I csect-name PAGE page-number IS WITHIN PHYSICAL ERROR RANGE
Explanation: The page specified for 'RECOVER page' is within the physical error range of the table space partition,
index space partition, or data set. 'RECOVER page' cannot be effective in this case, because the page would still be
within the physical error range and therefore inaccessible to the user.
System action: The RECOVER utility terminates with return code 8. No changes are made to the table space.
User response: Resubmit the RECOVER utility specifying 'error range'.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU504I csect-name MERGE STATISTICS FOR obj-type obj-qual.obj-name - NUMBER OF COPIES = cc, NUMBER OF PAGES MERGED = nnnnnn, ELAPSED TIME = hh/mm/ss
Explanation: This message is issued at the completion of the MERGE process for the MERGECOPY or RECOVER
utility. The message indicates the number of image copies currently processed ('cc') and the total number of pages
that were merged ('nnnnnn'). The same page can be obtained from more than one incremental image copy. MERGE is
repeated for MERGECOPY if all of the input image copy data sets cannot be allocated and a temporary work data set
has been specified.
For the RECOVER utility, MERGE is executed whether or not there are incremental image copies participating. In this
case, the number of copies ('cc') is one.
The elapsed time of the MERGE is 'hh/mm/ss', hours, minutes, and seconds, respectively.
System action: The MERGECOPY or RECOVER utility continues processing; this message is for information only.
User response: The statistics are indicative of the processing required. For MERGECOPY, it could indicate that next
time more input image copy data sets should be allocated. For example, if there was more than one MERGE pass
then this message will be issued more than once. For both MERGECOPY and RECOVER, it could indicate that more
frequent invocation of MERGECOPY is appropriate.
DSNU505I csect-name PAGE page-number IS BEYOND END OF obj-type
Explanation: A page number was found to be beyond the end of the table space, index space, or the current data
set.
System action: The RECOVER utility terminates with ABEND 04E reason code 00E40100. If RECOVER PAGE was
specified, then the utility terminates with return code 8 and no changes are made to the object.
User response: Check that the image copy data set(s) in use during the RECOVER contain valid pages. If running
RECOVER with the PAGE option, then resubmit the utility with the correct page specified.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU506I csect-name TABLESPACE obj-qualifier.obj-name DSNUM dsnum IS IN REORG PENDING STATE
Explanation: This message is issued at completion of a utility when an object has the REORP state set.
The utility can set the REORP state if the table space contains a table that includes an identity column. It can also set
the REORP state when a partitioned table space, which has had its limiting keys altered, is recovered to a point in
time.
System action: The utility continues processing.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU507I csect-name NO USABLE BACKUP FOR RECOVER
Explanation: The RECOVER utility determined that a backup was required but not found. The utility encountered
one of the following situations:
v An error occurred while processing the oldest available full image copy data set. This might be the only full image
copy data set available.
v While scanning backward through the SYSCOPY table, a LOAD LOG(NO) or REORG log(NO) record type was
found.
Any of the following is acceptable as a backup:
v A full image copy.
v A LOAD LOG(YES).
v A REORG LOG(YES).
v For RECOVER PAGE, an incremental image copy that contains the specified page.
v A 'no record found' return from the first request for a SYSCOPY record indicates that the object was entirely
populated by 'inserts'. The object will be recovered from the DB2 log if its entire history lies within the scope of the
log, that is, archive log data sets containing updates for the object have not been deleted.
System action: The RECOVER utility terminates.
User response: Re-create the object that was to be recovered.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU508I csect-name IN FALL BACK PROCESSING TO PRIOR FULL IMAGE COPY
Explanation: One of the following occurred:
v The RECOVER utility could not allocate the most recent full image copy data set. The prior full image copy is
used.
Accompanying messages indicate why the image copy data set could not be allocated.
v PAGE or ERROR RANGE was specified and the recoverable point identified an image copy that was created by
the DFSMSdss DUMP command with the CONCURRENT option. Such an image copy cannot be used to process
PAGE or ERROR RANGE. A prior recoverable point is located.
System action: The RECOVER utility continues processing, searching for the prior image copy.
DSNU509I csect-name - NO ERROR RANGE TO RECOVER
Explanation: The RECOVER utility was invoked to recover the existing ERROR RANGE. However, no ERROR
RANGE was found.
System action: This message indicates the completion of the RECOVER ERROR RANGE utility. Processing
continues to the next utility statement in the utility job step. If there are no more utility statements, the utility job
step is normally terminated.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU510I NO RECOVERY BASE AVAILABLE FOR RECOVERY OF obj-type obj-qual.obj-name
Explanation: It is not possible to locate a good recovery base. A recovery base could be either a full image copy or a
system-level backup. If you only take image copies, the following conditions are possible:
v No back level image copy exists, or
v An I/O error occurred while reading the back level image copies, or
v DB2 was unable to locate a suitable image copy
The return code that accompanies this message is 0 (informational) or 8 (error) under the following conditions:
0 (informational)
A full image copy is not found in the SYSCOPY table during RECOVER initialization or during fall back
processing or if YES was specified for the value of the SYSTEM_LEVEL_BACKUPS subsystem parameter
and a system-level backup was not chosen by RECOVER as a recovery base. However, a LOG(YES) event
was detected and recovery continues from the log. Note that if you have performed a REORG after your last
image copy or system-level backup, then the image copy of system-level backup will not be chosen as the
recovery base.
8 (error)
The RECOVER utility is in fallback mode and no base recoverable point (a full image copy or LOG(YES)
event) was found in the SYSCOPY table. Further utility processing is terminated.
System action: If the return code is 0, processing continues. If the return code is 8, further utility processing is
terminated.
System programmer response: If the return code is 8 and the object being recovered is a table space, the data must
be repaired so that a backup can be taken.
User response: Notify the system programmer if the return code is 8. If the return code is 0, no action is required.

Explanation: The requested recovery of an object would result in recovery entirely from the log. Because the object
is also in copy pending status, recovery might fail in log apply in these situations:
v A previous MODIFY utility job deleted the last recoverable point indicated in the SYSCOPY catalog table.
v A previous MODIFY utility job deleted all SYSCOPY entries.
In either case, the MODIFY utility leaves the object in copy pending status and the RECOVER utility is unable to
determine the reliability of recovery from the log.
System action: The RECOVER utility terminates with return code 8.
User response: Determine the recoverability status of the object. SYSCOPY information is probably not useful as no
recoverable point (FULL IMAGE COPY, REORG LOG(YES) or LOAD REPLACE LOG(YES)) was found by the
RECOVER utility. User information might be the only indication about recoverability.
To allow RECOVER to execute, copy pending status must be turned off. It is safest to make a full image copy before
attempting the recovery. Then run the RECOVER utility with the TORBA or TOLOGPOINT option.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.

DSNU514I csect-name RECOVERY DATA DOES NOT PERMIT DSNUM(ALL) RECOVERY OF obj-type obj-qual.obj-name
Explanation: Recovery was requested for an entire object. If the object is a table space, then the latest activity on the
entire table space was a REORG LOG (NO) or a LOAD LOG (NO). If the object is an index space, then the latest
activity on the entire index space was a REORG INDEX or REBUILD INDEX. If full image copies have been taken at
the data set level since then, recover the object on the data set level.
System action: RECOVER completes unsuccessfully with a return code of 8.
User response: Submit a recover job by specifying DSNUM (data set number) for each data set requiring recovery. If
the object is an index space, then the REBUILD INDEX utility may be used to rebuild the index.

DSNU516I NO BACKUP WAS TAKEN AFTER LOAD, REORG OR CHECK DATA LOG(NO) OF obj-type obj-qual.obj-name
Explanation: Recovery was requested for a data set of an object. If the object is a table space, then a system-level
backup or full image copy was not taken after or during a LOAD, REORG, or CHECK DATA without logging. The
table space is in an unrecoverable state. If the object is an index space, then a full image copy or system-level backup
was not taken after a REORG INDEX or REBUILD INDEX.
System action: The RECOVER utility completes unsuccessfully with a return code of 8.
System programmer response: The data should be repaired before a full image copy or system-level backup is
taken. The recovery information for the object (use the REPORT RECOVERY utility) should be scrutinized.
User response: If the object is a table space, the data set is in an unrecoverable state. If the object is an index space,
then the REBUILD INDEX utility may be used to rebuild the index. Notify the system programmer for corrective
action.

DSNU517I csect-name - SYSCOPY RECORD DELETED BY MODIFY UTILITY. DSN=dsn, VOL=SER=nnn, FILESEQNO=fff
Explanation: This message is repeated for each volume of a multivolume data set that is deleted.
The variables have the following meanings:
dsn The name of the image copy data set whose record was removed from the SYSCOPY table by the MODIFY
utility.
nnn The serial number of the volume containing the data set.
fff The tape file sequence number. It will be zero for DASD data sets.
System action: The MODIFY utility continues its termination processing.
System programmer response: Because DB2 no longer has any knowledge of the image copy data set, you may
delete it and reuse the space. If the last full image copy was deleted, ensure that another one is taken as soon as
possible.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU518I csect-name object-type object-qualifier.object-name CONTAINS BROKEN PAGE page-number, ERROR CODE error
Explanation: A broken page, page number, was detected during execution of an image copy utility job. The copy step
is terminated and the broken page is not copied to the output data set.
System action: COPY utility ends with a return code of 8.
System programmer response: Use either the RECOVER, RECOVER PAGE, or REPAIR utility to correct the broken
page. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: The associated data set has not been copied. If the object is in the COPY-pending status, it is in an
unrecoverable state. Notify the system programmer for corrective action.

DSNU519I csect-name TOCOPY DATA SET NOT FOUND
Explanation: The data set specified with the keywords TOCOPY, TOVOLUME, or TOSEQNO cannot be found in the
SYSCOPY table for the object to be recovered.
This may be caused by a mismatch in granularities. If the RECOVER specifies a particular DSNUM, the data set
specified with the TOCOPY keyword may be for an image copy of this DSNUM or of the entire table space or index
space. However, if the RECOVER is for the entire table space or index space, the specified data set must be for an
image copy of the entire table space or index space.
This message may also be issued if TOVOLUME is specified for a cataloged data set.
RECOVER TOCOPY can issue DSNU519I even if the data set information was correct but the data set was not for
this site. For example, if the DB2 subsystem is specified as LOCALSITE, but the TOCOPY data set information is for
a RECOVERYSITE data set, this message will be issued.
System action: RECOVER processing is terminated.
User response: Correct the input and resubmit the RECOVER job.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU520I csect-name RECOVER TO A PRIOR POINT IN TIME MIGHT LEAVE TABLE SPACE table-space-name INCONSISTENT
Explanation: RECOVER DSNUM to a previous point in time (for example, using the TOLOGPOINT option) was
specified for a nonpartitioned table space. You might have recovered a data set that has different compression
characteristics than the replaced data set. For example, the data set to which you recovered might have been
compressed with a different dictionary.
System action: Processing continues.
User response: The table space might be in an inconsistent state. If the dictionary was not built with the data set
that was just recovered, the results are unpredictable and might jeopardize all the data in the entire table space.
Recover all of the data sets in the table space to the same point in time. Do not ignore this message unless all data
sets in this table space were recovered to the same point in time. Otherwise, the state of this nonpartitioned table
space is inconsistent and unpredictable.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU521I csect-name - RECOVER UTILITY FAILED. UNABLE TO READ REQUIRED LOG RECORDS.
Explanation: Recovery was requested for a table space, index space, or data set. An attempt was made to apply
changes from the DB2 log, but the necessary log records could not be read from the log data set. This message is
accompanied by message DSNI007I.
System action: The RECOVER utility completes unsuccessfully with return code 8.
Operator response: Provide the console listing of the DSNI007I message for the system programmer.
System programmer response: Run the print log map (DSNJU004) utility. Find the data set that contains the
requested RBA or LRSN from the output of the utility.
User response: Consult the system programmer for corrective action.
Problem determination: If no listed data set contains the required RBA or LRSN, one of the following might have
occurred:
v The data set was deleted from the bootstrap data set (BSDS) by the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility. Rerun
the utility to insert the missing data set name. DB2 must be stopped to run this utility.
v The BSDS was damaged. The BSDS can be restored using the dump and the most recent archive log data set. Run
the change log inventory (DSNJU003) tility to supply changes that occurred during and after the last offload
operation. Changes can be determined from the operator's console listing.
If a listed log data set contains the required RBA or LRSN, this message is preceded by one or more DSNJxxx error
messages. See the explanation of those messages for the appropriate action.

Explanation: Recovery was requested for an index, but activity on its table space (identified by the
SYSIBM.SYSCOPY columns) prohibits recovery. The use of an index's full image copy by recovery is prohibited by a
REORG or LOAD on its underlying table space.
System action: Utility processing is terminated. All objects in the RECOVER statement are left in the same state as
before the RECOVER utility was invoked.
User response: Use the REBUILD INDEX utility to rebuild the index from the table space. For more information
about the recoverability of this index, run the REPORT RECOVERY utility on both the index and its table space.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU523I RECOVER UTILITY FAILED. NO RECOVERY BASE WAS AVAILABLE AND THE FIRST LOG RECORD WAS NOT THE REQUIRED INITIALIZATION RECORD
Explanation: RECOVER was requested for a table space or a data set of a table space and no image copy or
system-level backup was available. Recovery was attempted from the log and failed due to missing data set
initialization records. Specifically, the log records which format space map and header pages were missing.
System action: RECOVER completes unsuccessfully with a return code of 8.
System programmer response: Use the problem determination information given below to determine if a user error
has occurred. If possible, correct the error and resubmit the RECOVER utility job for this table space or data set. If
you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting
the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference. for a discussion of
possible recovery procedures.
User response: The associated data set has been reset to an empty state. Notify system programmer for corrective
action.
Problem determination: This message was preceded by message DSNU513I which identifies the log RBA range
being applied. Run the print log map (DSNJU004) utility for the table space in question over the indicated log RBA
range.
This will show what log records are present and may assist in determining if a log data set has been damaged or
deleted, or if the BSDS has been damaged. If damage to table space DSNDB01.SYSLGRNX is suspected, recover it
and attempt the earlier failing recovery again.

DSNU525I csect-name RECOVERY DATA DOES NOT PERMIT DSNUM(ALL) RECOVERY OF obj-type obj-qual.obj-name
Explanation: Recovery was requested for an entire object. However, the object is not recoverable at that level for one
of the following reasons:
v The object was recovered to a point in time (for example, TOLOGPOINT was specified), which required fall back
processing. However, no subsequent image copy was taken to establish a base for recovery.
v A partition of the object was recovered to a point in time after the last full image copy of the object was taken.
System action: The RECOVER utility completes unsuccessfully with return code 8.
User response: Submit the RECOVER job with DSNUM specified for each data set for which recovery is required.

DSNU526I NO BACKUP WAS TAKEN AFTER PARTIAL RECOVERY OF obj-type objqual. obj-name
Explanation: Recovery was requested for a data set of an object. However, an earlier point-in-time recovery (for
example, using the TOLOGPOINT option) was specified and no subsequent image copy or system-level backup was
taken to establish a base for recovery.
System action: The RECOVER utility completes unsuccessfully with return code 8.
System programmer response: You can use the RECOVER utility with the TOCOPY, TORBA, or TOLOGPOINT
option to force recovery to an earlier point in time. You can use the DSN1COPY utility to restore the data set to an
earlier image copy. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about
identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
for a discussion of database recovery procedures.
User response: The associated data set is in a nonrecoverable state. Consult the system programmer for corrective
action.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU527I csect-name DB2 OBJECT RECOVERED TO AN INDETERMINATE POINT
Explanation: The image copy data set specified with the TOCOPY keyword of the RECOVER utility was one of the
following:
v An image copy data set made with the SHRLEVEL CHANGE option. In this mode, changes might have been
made to the object while image copy was in progress. If a change was made to a page before image copy
processed the page, the update will be in the copy data set. If a change was made to a page after image copy
processed it, the change will not appear in the copy data set. The data set may contain partial updates from some
transactions.
v An image copy data set made during the LOAD REPLACE utility. An image copy produced during LOAD
REPLACE will not contain updates made to the table space to correct unique index violations during the
INDEXVAL phase or referential constraint violations during the ENFORCE phase. Therefore, it is not
recommended as a recovery point.
If the object recovered is a table space, then indexes on the table space are placed in rebuild pending status and
dependent table spaces, if any, are placed in check pending status. The indexes placed in rebuild pending are
identified by message DSNU831I, and the dependent table spaces placed in check pending are identified by message DSNU563I.
System action: The utility terminates normally.
User response: Based on the explanation above, determine if the recovery is satisfactory. Rebuild the indexes
identified by message DSNU557I in the job output. Run CHECK DATA on the table spaces identified by message DSNU563I to correct any referential constraint violations.  If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference. for a discussion
of database recovery procedures.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU528I NO FULL IMAGE COPY WAS AVAILABLE AND THERE ARE NO UPDATES TO APPLY FROM THE DB2 LOG FOR TABLESPACE tablespace-name DSNUM dsnum
Explanation: Recovery was requested for a table space or a data set of a table space and no image copy or
system-level backup was available. Recovery was attempted from the log, but no log records were applied because
no SYSLGRNX records that correspond to the recovery scope were found.
tablespace-name
The name of the table space for which recovery was requested.
dsnum Identifies the partition or data set that is to be recovered. If dsnum is 0, recovery was requested for the entire
table space.
System action: The associated data set was reset to an empty state, and the data set was placed in
RECOVER-pending status.
If RECOVER was processing a list of table spaces, only the associated data set was reset to an empty state. However,
all data sets in the list were placed in RECOVER-pending status.
System programmer response: Use the information in the problem determination section to determine whether a
user error occurred. Correct the error and resubmit the RECOVER utility for the table space.
User response: If the TORBA or TOLOGPOINT option was specified, use the information in the problem
determination section to verify that the value is a valid RBA or LRSN. Correct the error and resubmit the RECOVER
utility for the table space.
Problem determination: Run the REPORT RECOVERY utility for the table space at the appropriate table space or
data set level (DSNUM). The output shows the recovery points (SYSCOPY records) and the update log ranges
(SYSLGRNX records) that exist for the table space.
If you take system-level backups with the BACKUP SYSTEM utility, run the Print Log Map (DSNJU004) utility to
print the system-level backup information. If you use data sharing, ensure that the system-level backup information
from all members is gathered. Locate the system-level backup information in the DSNJU004 output and compare it
with the output from the REPORT RECOVERY utility output.

However, you can specify these table spaces in a list with their indexes that are defined by IBM.
For the RECOVER utility, you cannot recover more than one directory or catalog table space in a list. Directory and
catalog table spaces must be recovered individually in a particular order, because the recovery of some objects
depends on information in other objects. Indexes that are defined by IBM can be specified with their associated
directory or catalog table space in a list.

Name of the table space.
ictype and stype
The type of event is recorded in the ictype and stype columns.
ICTYPE=R,S,W, or X (REORG, LOAD REPLACE, CATENFM)
STYPE=A
A SYSCOPY record for a REORG or LOAD REPLACE operation that redistributed data
across partitions was found. The partitions that were affected by the ALTER INDEX that
changed the limit keys must be recovered in the same list.
STYPE=S
The CATENFM utility was run. A point-in-time recovery before the CATENFM process is
not allowed unless the entire system (including the DB2 catalog and directory) are
recovered to the same point.
STYPE= "blank"
A SYSCOPY record was found for a REORG operation with the LOG(YES) option in the
recovery period. Recovery to a prior point in time is not possible.
ICTYPE=A (ALTER)
STYPE=C
An ALTER took place that added a column to a table and the column was not added to
the index in the same commit scope. Rebuild the index instead of recovering it.
STYPE=D
One of the following situations occurred:
v If the TTYPE value is blank, ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN SET DEFAULT was
executed, and point-in-time recovery before the ALTER is not allowed. For this case, the
TTYPE value is blank.
v If the TTYPE value is non-blank, the TTYPE value is the data set size. The DSSIZE
attribute of the table space was updated by an ALTER statement. Recovery to a point in
time before the ALTER operation is not allowed.
STYPE=E
An ALTER TABLE EXCHANGE occurred and a point-in-time recovery before the exchange
is not allowed. If the object that is being recovered is an index, the index cannot be
recovered before the rotation of its underlying table.
STYPE=F
The buffer pool attribute of the object was updated by an ALTER statement and a
point-in-time recovery before the update is not allowed.
STYPE=G
An ALTER INDEX REGENERATE was done. Rebuild the index instead of recovering it.
STYPE=I
A SYSCOPY record for a REORG with TTYPE=I or TTYPE=D indicates that a REORG to
materialize an ALTER COLUMN INLINE LENGTH was found. However, not all related
objects (base table space and LOB table space) were recovered as a set to the same point in
time. The point-in-time recovery is not allowed unless both the related base and LOB
objects are recovered as a set.
STYPE=M
The MAXPARTITIONS attribute of the table space was updated by an ALTER statement
and a point-in-time recovery before the update is not allowed.
STYPE=N
The index was updated by an ALTER statement to have the NOT PADDED attribute.
Rebuild the index instead of recovering it.
STYPE=P
The index was updated by an ALTER statement to have the PADDED attribute. Rebuild
the index instead of recovering it.
STYPE=R
A table space partition was rotated and a point-in-time recovery before the rotation is not
allowed. If the object that is being recovered is one of the following objects, it cannot be
recovered to a point in time before the rotation:
v An index partition
v A LOB table space that belongs to the rotated partition
STYPE=S
The SEGSIZE attribute of the table space was updated by an ALTER statement and a
point-in-time recovery before the update is not allowed.
STYPE=V
An ALTER TABLE COLUMN occurred on an indexed column for a numeric data type
change. Rebuild the index instead of recovering it
STYPE=Z
A column that is in the key of an index that was versioned before DB2 Version 8 was
updated by an ALTER statement. Rebuild the index instead of recovering it
ICTYPE=F (full image copy)
One of the following situations occurred:
v An attempt was made to recover an index to a prior point-in-time and more than 16 versions of
the index exist. (ALTER TABLE COLUMN was done more than 16 times to alter the index key).
The point-in-time recovery is not allowed.
v An attempt was made to recover a compressed, versioned index, but the format of the image
copy of the index is not correct. This situation occurs when the image copy was taken before DB2
code was applied to allow recovery of compressed, versioned indexes.
In both cases, rebuild the index.
ICTYPE=L
STYPE=M
Indicates that an SQL mass DELETE, TRUNCATE TABLE, DROP TABLE, or ALTER
TABLE ROTATE PARTITION occurred on a segmented table space or universal table
space. The LOWDSNUM column contains the OBID of the affected table. The BACKOUT
YES option for RECOVER is not supported.
ICTYPE=M (modify recovery)
STYPE=R
Indicates that the MODIFY RECOVERY utility deleted recovery information that is
required for this recovery.
ICTYPE=P (point in time recovery)
An index is being recovered to a point in time that is different than the point in time of its
underlying table space. The recover of the index is not allowed. Use the REBUILD INDEX utility
instead.
ICTYPE=P or E
If the DSNU1528I message was previously issued for this object, then see that message for details.
System action: The RECOVER utility terminates.
User response: Run the REPORT RECOVERY utility, and analyze the report of the recovery information for the
object.
If a SYSCOPY record for a REORG or LOAD REPLACE operation that redistributed partition data was found, add
the missing partitions to the recover list. Use the LOWDSNUM and HIGHDSNUM values in the SYSCOPY record as
a guide.
If a SYSCOPY record for a REORG operation that materialized an ALTER COLUMN INLINE LENGTH was found,
add the missing objects to the point-in-time recover list.
If the object is an index, use the REBUILD INDEX utility to rebuild the index.

DSNU557I csect-name - obj-type obj-qual.obj-name IS IN RECOVER PENDING
Explanation: If the REBUILD utility issued this message, the corresponding table space to this index was rebuilt to a
point in time with keyword TOCOPY, TOLOGPOINT, or TORBA. Thus, the index was placed in REBUILD pending
status.
If the REBUILD INDEX utility issued this message, the index is in REBUILD pending status. Either duplicate index
entries existed during the BUILD phase of the REBUILD INDEX, or invalid KEY/RIDs, which do not belong to the
partition of the cluster index, were detected. The duplicate index entries or invalid KEY/RID entries must be
resolved before starting the REBUILD INDEX utility again to REBUILD the index and remove the index from
REBUILD pending status.
If the REORG utility with SHRLEVEL REFERENCE or CHANGE (or -TERM UTILITY) issued this message, the index
is in REBUILD pending status. During the renaming of a data set during REORG, either a data set with the source
name did not yet exist or a data set with the target name already existed.
User response: If the REBUILD or REORG utility (or -TERM UTILITY) issued this message, use the REBUILD
INDEX utility to REBUILD this index.
If the REBUILD INDEX utility issued this message, take one of the following actions:
v Resolve the duplicate index entries or invalid keys and rerun the REBUILD INDEX utility.
v Use the REPAIR SET NORCVRPEND utility or the START DATABASE FORCE command to reset the REBUILD
pending status. However, these two options will not correct the index.
Severity: 4 (warning) or 8 (error)
DSNU558I csect-name ALL INDEXES OF TABLESPACE= table space-name ARE IN REBUILD PENDING
Explanation: The REBUILD TORBA, TOLOGPOINT, or TOCOPY utility issues this message to inform the user of
the state of all indexes belonging to the REBUILDed table space. All indexes were put in REBUILD pending status to
prevent data and index inconsistency. All indexes should be REBUILDed before they are used.
System action: The REBUILD utility completed successfully.
User response: REBUILD or rebuild all indexes of the REBUILD table space.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU559I csect-name - obj-type obj-qual.obj-name PARTITION partition-number IS IN RECOVER PENDING STATE
Explanation: If the REBUILD utility issued this message, one partition of a partitioned table space is being rebuilt to
a point in time with keyword TOCOPY, TOLOGPOINT, or TORBA. The corresponding index for that partition was
placed in rebuild pending status.
If the REBUILD INDEX utility issued this message, the index or the partition of a cluster index is in rebuild pending
status. Either duplicate index entries existed during the BUILD phase of the REBUILD INDEX or INDEX PART, or
invalid KEY/RIDs, which do not belong to the partition of the cluster index, were detected. The duplicate index
entries or invalid KEY/RID entries must be resolved before starting the REBUILD INDEX utility again to rebuild the
index and remove the index from rebuild pending status.
If the REORG utility with SHRLEVEL REFERENCE or CHANGE (or -TERM UTILITY) issued this message, one
partition of a partitioned index was placed in rebuild pending status. During the renaming of a data set during
REORG, either a data set with the source name did not yet exist or a data set with the target name already existed.
User response: If the REBUILD or REORG utility (or -TERM UTILITY) issued the message, rebuild this index with
the REBUILD INDEX utility.
If the REBUILD INDEX utility issued this message, take one of the following actions:
v Resolve duplicate index entries or invalid keys and rerun the REBUILD INDEX utility.
v Use the REPAIR SET NORCVRPEND utility or START DATABASE FORCE command to reset the rebuild pending
status. However, these two options will not correct the index.
Severity: 4 (warning) or 8 (error)
DSNU560I csect-name - TABLESPACE= database.tablespace PART= partition number IS IN RECOVERY PENDING STATE
Explanation: The table space partition of a table space on which the utility was running is in recovery pending
status. A RECOVER TABLESPACE at the partition level is required.
System action: No action is taken.
User response: Take one of the following actions:
v Run the RECOVER TABLESPACE utility on the table space partition.
v Run the LOAD REPLACE utility on the table space partition.
v Use the REPAIR SET NORCVRPEND utility or the START DATABASE FORCE command to reset the recovery
pending status. However, these two options will not correct the table space.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU561I csect-name - obj-type obj-qual.obj-name PARTITION part-number IS IN CHECK PENDING
Explanation: This message is issued to report the check pending state of the specified partition.
User response: If the object is a table space partition with referential relationships, then run the CHECK DATA
utility to check for referential integrity violations.
If the object is a base table space partition, then run the CHECK DATA utility to validate the auxiliary columns.
If the object is an index space partition, then run the CHECK INDEX utility to verify that the index keys are
consistent with the data in the table space partition.
Correct all errors before attempting to use the object again.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU562I csect name - TABLESPACE database.tablespace IS IN RECOVERY PENDING
Explanation: The table space against which the utility was running is in recovery pending status. A RECOVER
TABLESPACE is required.
System action: No action is taken.
User response: Take one of the following actions:
v Run the RECOVER TABLESPACE utility on the table space.
v Run the LOAD REPLACE utility on the table space.
v Use the REPAIR SET NORCVRPEND utility or the START DATABASE FORCE command to reset the recovery
pending status. However, these two options will not correct the table space.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU563I csect name- obj-type obj-qual.obj-name IS IN CHECK PENDING
Explanation: This message is issued to report the check pending state of the specified object.
User response: If the object is a table space with referential relationships, then run the CHECK DATA utility to
check for referential integrity violations.
If the object is a base table space with LOB columns, then run the CHECK DATA utility to validate the auxiliary
columns.
If the object is a LOB table space, then run the CHECK LOB utility to validate the structure of the LOB table space.
If the object is an index space, then run the CHECK INDEX utility to verify that the index keys are consistent with
the data in the table space or table space partition.
Correct all errors before attempting to use the object again.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU564I csect - RESTART NOT ALLOWED FOR obj-type obj-qual.obj-name
Explanation: Restart of the RECOVER utility is not allowed for one of the following reasons:
1. During the RESTORE phase, access to image copies failed. Therefore, RECOVER determined an earlier point of
recovery to search for available image copies. RECOVER might not be able to re-create the original failures for
restart.
2. The utility uses the LOGONLY option and was previously restarted with RESTART(CURRENT). It cannot now be
started with RESTART(PHASE).
System action: The utility job terminates. If RECOVER acts on a list of objects, the restarted job terminates with the
first object for which restart is not allowed.
User response: For case 1, execute REPORT RECOVERY on the object and also collect the output from the previous
execution of RECOVER TABLESPACE. Using those two outputs and the console log, determine the reason for the
failure during the RESTORE phase. Correct the reason for the failure, if necessary. Terminate the outstanding utility
then rerun the RECOVER TABLESPACE without RESTART.
For case 2, restart the utility with RESTART(CURRENT) or restore the data sets and rerun the RECOVER job from the
beginning.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU565I csect-name CHECK CONSTRAINT constraint-name ON TABLE table-name WAS CREATED AFTER THE TARGET RECOVERY POINT
Explanation: The check constraint constraint-name was created on table table-name after the target recovery point. The
target recovery point is the specified time or RBA in the point-in-time recovery. The associated table space was placed
in check pending status because the RECOVER utility cannot determine whether check integrity was maintained.
Data in the table might have constraint violations.
System action: RECOVER processing continues.
User response: Resolve the check pending status.
Severity: 4 (warning)

DSNU566I csect-name RESTORE OF obj-type obj-qual.obj-name FROM DATA SET data-set-name COMPLETED, ELAPSED TIME = hh:mm:ss
Explanation: This message is issued at the successful completion of the RESTORE phase of the RECOVER utility
when the DFSMSdss RESTORE command is issued. The data-set-name identifies the DFSMS concurrent copy that was
being restored. The elapsed time of the RESTORE is shown in hours, minutes, and seconds.
System action: RECOVER utility processing continues.
User response: No action is required.
DSNU568I csect-name obj-type obj-qual.obj-name IS IN INFORMATIONAL COPY-PENDING STATE
Explanation: This message reports that the state of a table space or index has informational COPY- pending status.
This state is an advisory state, so the object is available for read and write access. The Informational Copy Pending
state is set for table spaces with the NOT LOGGED attribute when the table space is opened for update. The
Informational Copy Pending state is set for indexes when a new recovery base needs to be established due to a
non-recoverable event (such as a REORG or LOAD utility).
System action: None.
User response: Take a full image copy to remove the informational COPY-pending status.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU569I csect-name RESTORE OF obj-type obj-qual.obj-name FROM DATA SET data-set-name FAILED WITH RETURN CODE return-code
Explanation: This message is issued in the RESTORE phase of the RECOVER utility. The DFSMSdss RESTORE
command was issued to restore the DFSMS concurrent copy named data-set-name. The return code is from DFSMSdss
RESTORE.
System action: The RECOVER utility searches for the next recoverable point. DFSMSdss issues ADR messages to the
job output to indicate the reason for the return code.
User response: You might want to investigate why this DFDSS RESTORE command failed. Collect any console
messages. Look up the return code and any ADR messages in the appropriate DFSMSdss manual.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.

DSNU600I csect-name INDEX creator.index-name POINTS TO A DIFFERENT DATABASE.
Explanation: A specified index does not point to a table in the database selected. For a RUNSTATS Format 1
invocation, the database is the one specified (or defaulted) in the TABLESPACE parameter. For a RUNSTATS Format
2 invocation, the database is the one which contains the first index in the index-name list.
System action: All remaining RUNSTATS invocation parameters are validated and the executing utility job
terminates. Work performed by previous utilities in the job step remains in effect. Subsequent utility control
statements are flushed. No record of the utility job step is retained in the system; therefore, it cannot be restarted.
User response: Ensure that all indexes in the list point to the same database and resubmit the RUNSTATS job.
Problem determination: Refer to catalog table SYSIBM.SYSINDEXES to determine the table upon which the index is
based. This table must be in the database and table space targeted by the RUNSTATS utility.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU601I csect-name INDEX creator.index-name POINTS TO A DIFFERENT TABLESPACE.
Explanation: A specified index does not point to a table in the table space selected. The table space is either the one
specified in the TABLESPACE parameter or the one which contains the table pointed to by the first specified index.
System action: All remaining RUNSTATS invocation parameters are validated and the executing utility job
terminates. Work performed by previous utilities in the job step remains in effect. Subsequent utility control
statements are flushed. No record of the utility job step is retained in the system; therefore, it cannot be restarted.
User response: Ensure that all indexes in the list point to tables in the targeted table space and resubmit the
RUNSTATS job.
Problem determination: Refer to catalog table SYSIBM.SYSINDEXES to determine the table upon which the index is
based. Using the table-name found in SYSIBM.SYSINDEXES, refer to catalog table SYSIBM.SYSTABLES to determine
the containing table space.

DSNU602I csect-name STATISTICS ARE NOT COLLECTED FOR NONPARTITIONED INDEX creator.index-name
Explanation: A LOAD or REORG TABLESPACE utility invocation specified the STATISTICS and PART keywords,
but a nonpartitioned index exists. Statistics cannot be collected for nonpartitioned indexes for partition-level inline
statistics, because a complete index scan is used to capture these statistics.
System action: No statistics are collected for the specified indexes, and processing continues. When INDEX ALL is
specified, a DSNU602I message is issued for each nonpartitioned index.
User response: Invoke the RUNSTATS utility for the object to collect statistics for the nonpartitioned indexes.

caused by one of these errors:
v Not defining any tables in the table space (RC=4).
v Not creating the accompanying partitioned index if the table space is partitioned (RC=8).
System action: If the return code is 8, utility processing terminates. If the return code is 4, utility processing
continues to the next request.
User response: Complete the table space definition by creating at least one table in the table space, or create the
accompanying partitioned index if the table space is partitioned.
Problem determination: Issue an SQL SELECT statement on the catalog to determine if the tables or a partitioned
index was not created for the table space.
Severity: 8 (error) or 4 (warning)

Explanation: The RUNSTATS utility issues this message to report the statistics collected for the indexed column
column-name. If more than one column is listed, then the statistics collected and the column values reported represent
the concatenation of those columns.
The value for CARDINALITY is the number of distinct values for the listed columns. This statistic appears only if the
KEYCARD option was specified.
The values under FREQUENCY are the same as those that are inserted into the DB2 catalog. Consider each
'frequency' as a four-digit number with an implied decimal point two places to the left of the final digit. The
resulting number is the percentage of total rows in the table that contain a particular value for the named index
columns.
Frequency is associated with the occurrence of a single value which is listed under COLVALUE.
Frequencies for the most frequent values are collected by default, or if the FREQVAL option is specified and given a
COUNT value greater than zero. If the default is taken, then the ten most frequently occurring values are reported in
descending order of frequency.
v If fewer than ten values appear, then there are fewer than ten distinct values in the index.
v If no values appear, then the values are uniformly distributed.
v If frequencies appear but column values do not, then the invoker of RUNSTATS is not authorized to read the table.

FREQUENCY COLVALUE
frequency Xhex-string
frequency Xhex-string
.. ..
frequency Xhex-string
Explanation: The RUNSTATS utility issues this message to report the statistics collected for the indexed column
column-name partition part-num. If more than one column is listed, then the statistics collected and the column values
reported represent the concatenation of those columns.
The value for CARDINALITY is the number of distinct values for the listed columns. This statistic appears only if the
KEYCARD option was specified.
The values under FREQUENCY are the same as those that are inserted into the DB2 catalog. Consider each
'frequency' as a four-digit number with an implied decimal point two places to the left of the final digit. The
resulting number is the percentage of total rows in the table that contain a particular value for the named index
columns.
Frequency is associated with the occurrence of a single value which is listed under COLVALUE.
Frequencies for the most frequent values are collected by default, or if the FREQVAL option is specified and given a
COUNT value greater than zero. If the default is taken, then the ten most frequently occurring values, plus the
lowest and highest values in the partition (if not already included in the ten greatest frequencies), are reported in
descending order of frequency.
v If fewer than ten values appear, then there are fewer than ten distinct values in the index.
v If no values appear, then the values are uniformly distributed.
v If frequencies appear but column values do not, then the invoker of RUNSTATS is not authorized to read the table.
Message DSNU619I is issued to identify the table.

User response: Correct the index name and/or the TABLESPACE parameters such that a single table space is
involved, and rerun the utility job.
Problem determination: To CHECK or REBUILD ALL INDEXES in a table space, use the TABLESPACE keyword,
but do not use the list option. This is one way to correct this error. If you want to correct the list of indexes specified
in the index name list, the following procedure will locate the table space name related to the index 'iiii'.
The index name 'iiii' reported in the message is of the form 'creator.name'. Obtain the TBCREATOR and TBNAME
columns from the DB2 catalog table SYSIBM.SYSINDEXES, where columns CREATOR and NAME have the values
reported in the message. Obtain the DBNAME and TSNAME columns from the DB2 catalog table
SYSIBM.SYSTABLES, where columns CREATOR and NAME have the values obtained from TBCREATOR and
TBNAME of SYSIBM.SYSINDEXES.
The values for DBNAME and TSNAME must be the same for all indexes specified in the index name list and must
be the same as the table space name specified on the TABLESPACE keyword if provided.

Explanation: The row at RID 'rrrr' resides in the wrong partition. The partitioning KEY 'kkkk' for partitioning
INDEX 'iiii' indicates that the row at RID 'rrrr' should reside in partition 'pppp', however the rid indicates that the
row contains partition 'wwww'.
System action: Utility processing continues.
User response: Run RECOVER TABLESPACE utility to recover the data or run REPAIR DELETE utility to delete the
row 'rrrr' followed by CHECK INDEX and CHECK DATA utility if referential constraints are involved.
Problem determination: The inconsistency between the table space partition number of a row and the index space
partition number of the row's clustering key may be due to a DB2 internal error, but is most likely due to a user
using the DSN1COPY service aid to populate a target table space with data from a source table space when the
clustering key values on the source and target table spaces are not identical.

Explanation: CATMAINT CONVERT TO TYPE 1 DIRECTORY alters the indexes DSNSCT02, DSNLUX01,
DSNLUX02, and DSNLLX02 to type 1 with more than one subpage. In a data sharing environment, there cannot be
inter-DB2 R/W interest on type 1 indexes with more than one subpage (they cannot become group buffer pool
dependent). This means that any read or update request that causes inter-DB2 R/W interest on these directory indexes
is denied with a 'resource unavailable' condition.
For directory indexes, only type 2 indexes can have full R/W sharing among data sharing members.
System action: Processing continues.
User response: With very few exceptions, indexes on the directory will have inter-DB2 R/W interest if there are two

DSNU805I csect-name - TABLE=table_name COLUMN=column_name IS OUT OF SYNCH ROWID=rowid VERSION=version
Explanation: The CHECK DATA utility found an auxiliary index entry for the LOB column named column_name
with ROWID, rowid, and version, version. The base table row with ROWID, rowid, has a version value greater then
that of the index record for the column specified.
The state changes below take place if SHRLEVEL REFERENCE is specified or defaulted. If SHRLEVEL CHANGE is
specified, the state of the table space remains unchanged.
System action: If AUXERROR REPORT was specified, this error is reported only. The base table space is set to an
Aux Check Pending state.
If AUXERROR INVALIDATE was specified, the LOB column is set invalid. The base table space is set to an Aux
Warning state.
Programmer response: CHECK DATA relies on information in LOB table space and in the auxiliary index being
correct. Before running CHECK DATA to check auxiliary columns, first run CHECK LOB and then run REBUILD
INDEX or CHECK INDEX. CHECK LOB ensures the validity of the LOB table space. REBUILD INDEX or CHECK
INDEX ensures the validity of the auxiliary index.
If AUXERROR REPORT was specified, run the CHECK DATA utility with AUXERROR INVALIDATE to set the
base table column invalid.
If AUXERROR INVALIDATE was specified, use SQL to update the LOB column or delete the base table row. Use
REPAIR to delete the LOB from the LOB table space using the ROWID and version reported in the message. Rerun
the CHECK DATA utility with AUXERROR INVALIDATE specified. If all Auxiliary Column Check errors were
corrected, Aux Warning is reset.
The REPAIR utility can be used to reset the Aux Warning state.
Severity: 4 (Warning)
DSNU806I csect-name - TABLE=table_name COLUMN=column_name WAS SET INVALID ROWID=rowid VERSION=version

Programmer response: None. If all Auxilary Column Check errors were corrected, Aux Warning will be reset.
DSNU809I csect-name - TABLE=table_name COLUMN=column_name IS MISSING IN INDEX index-name ROWID=rowid VERSION=version
Explanation: The CHECK DATA utility found a record in the table named table-name in the row with a ROWID of
rowid. The column named column-name did not have an index entry in the on the auxiliary index named index-name.
The version for the LOB column was version.
The state changes take place if SHRLEVEL REFERENCE is specified or defaulted. If SHRLEVEL CHANGE is
specified, the state of the table space remains unchanged.
System action: If AUXERROR REPORT was specified, this error is reported only. The base table space is set to an
Aux Check Pending state.
If AUXERROR INVALIDATE was specified, the LOB column is set invalid. The base table space is set to an Aux
Warning state.
Utility returns completion code=4.
Programmer response: CHECK DATA relies on information in LOB table space and in the auxiliary index being
correct. Before running CHECK DATA to check auxiliary columns, first run CHECK LOB and then run REBUILD
INDEX or CHECK INDEX. CHECK LOB ensures the validity of the LOB table space. REBUILD INDEX or CHECK
INDEX ensures the validity of the auxiliary index.
If AUXERROR REPORT was specified, run the CHECK DATA utility with AUXERROR INVALIDATE to set the
base table column invalid.
If AUXERROR INVALIDATE was specified, use SQL to update the LOB column or delete the base table row. Rerun
the CHECK DATA utility with AUXERROR INVALIDATE specified. If all Auxiliary Column Check errors were
corrected, Aux Warning will be reset.
The REPAIR utility can be used to reset the Aux Warning state.
DSNU811I csect-name - TABLE=table_name COLUMN=column_name IS INVALID ROWID=rowid VERSION=version
Explanation: The CHECK DATA utility found a record in the table named table-name in the row with ROWID rowid.
The column named column-name was marked invalid by a prior execution of the CHECK DATA utility with
AUXERROR INVALIDATE specified. The version for the LOB column was version.
The state changes take place if SHRLEVEL REFERENCE is specified or defaulted. If SHRLEVEL CHANGE is
specified, the state of the table space remains unchanged.
System action: Utility returns completion code=4. The base table space is set to a Aux Warning state.
Programmer response: If AUXERROR INVALIDATE was specified, use SQL to update the LOB column or delete
the base table row. Rerun the CHECK DATA utility with AUXERROR INVALIDATE specified. If all Auxiliary
Column Check errors were corrected, Aux Warning will be reset.
The REPAIR utility can be used to reset the Aux Warning state.
DSNU813I csect-name - LOB IN TABLE SPACE=lob_table_space_name WITH ROWID=rowid AND VERSION=version HAS NO BASE TABLE ROW
Explanation: The CHECK DATA utility found a LOB in the LOB table space named lob_table_space_name but did not
find a row in the base table for this LOB. The LOB has a ROWID of rowid and version of version.
The state changes take place if SHRLEVEL REFERENCE is specified or defaulted. If SHRLEVEL CHANGE is
specified, the state of the table space remains unchanged.
System action: Utility returns completion code=4.
Programmer response: CHECK DATA relies on information in the index on the auxiliary table and LOB table space
being correct. Before running CHECK DATA to check auxiliary columns, first run CHECK LOB and then run
REBUILD INDEX or CHECK INDEX. CHECK LOB ensures the validity of the LOB table space. REBUILD INDEX or
CHECK INDEX ensures the validity of the auxiliary index.
The LOB can be deleted using the REPAIR utility. Specify LOCATE ROWID VERSION DELETE.
DSNU814I csect-name - TABLE=table_name COLUMN=column_name IS ZERO OR NULL BUT ENTRY IN INDEX index-name FOUND ROWID=rowid VERSION=version
Explanation: The CHECK DATA utility found a record in the table named table-name in the row with a ROWID of
rowid. The column named column-name was indicated null or zero length, but an index entry with the same ROWID
was found in the index on the auxiliary table named index-name. The version for the LOB column was version.
The state changes take place if SHRLEVEL REFERENCE is specified or defaulted. If SHRLEVEL CHANGE is
specified, the state of the table space remains unchanged.
System action: The fact that a LOB column entry exists in the index on the auxiliary table when the LOB column is
marked null or has a null length does not hinder LOB column processing.
If AUXERROR INVALIDATE was specified, the LOB column is not set invalid for this error.
Programmer response: CHECK DATA relies on information in the index on the auxiliary table and LOB table space
being correct. If you did not run CHECK LOB followed by REBUILD INDEX or CHECK INDEX prior to running
CHECK DATA, then before running CHECK DATA again, run CHECK LOB followed by REBUILD INDEX or
CHECK INDEX. CHECK LOB checks the validity of the LOB table space and REBUILD INDEX or CHECK INDEX
ensures that the auxiliary index is valid.
The LOB can be deleted from the LOB table space by using REPAIR LOCATE TABLESPACE ROWID DELETE
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU815I csect-name - TABLESPACE table-space-name IS IN AUX CHECK PENDING STATE
Explanation: If the CHECK DATA utility issued the message then the utility found auxiliary check errors.
AUXERROR REPORT was specified, so errors were left as found.
Auxiliary check pending is a prohibitive state.
Previous error messages report the errors found. Regarding other utilities that can tolerate auxiliary check pending, the
pending state will be reported.
System action: Utility returns completion code 4 or 8.
Programmer response: Use the CHECK DATA with AUXERROR INVALIDATE. This will modify the auxiliary check
errors so they can be corrected and set the state of the table space to auxiliary warning.
After running CHECK DATA with AUXERROR INVALIDATE, use SQL to update the LOB column or delete the base
table row. Rerun the CHECK DATA utility with AUXERROR INVALIDATE specified. If all auxiliary check errors were
corrected, auxiliary warning will be reset.
The auxiliary check pending state can also be reset using REPAIR with SET NOAUXCHKP. Resetting auxiliary check
pending with REPAIR will have unpredictable results.
DSNU816I csect-name - TABLESPACE table-space-name IS IN AUX WARNING STATE
Explanation: The CHECK DATA utility found auxiliary check errors. AUXERROR INVALIDATE was specified, so
LOB columns in error were marked invalid.
Auxiliary warning is a non-prohibitive state. Updating the LOB column or deleting the row containing the LOB
column by SQL is permitted. Valid LOBs may be accessed, however any attempt to retrieve an invalid modified LOB
column by SQL will result in a -904 return code.
Previous error messages report the errors found.
System action: Processing continues.
Programmer response: Use SQL to update or delete the LOB columns in error. Use CHECK DATA with AUXERROR
INVALIDATE to verify all errors were corrected and to reset the auxiliary warning state.
The auxiliary warning state can also be reset using REPAIR with SET NOAUXWARN.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU817I csect-name- TABLE=table-name COLUMN=column-name IS COMPLETELY INLINE BUT ENTRY IN INDEX index-name FOUND ROWID=row-id VERSION=version

System action: LOB column processing is unaffected. If the AUXERROR INVALIDATE option was specified, the
LOB column is not set to an invalid status for this error.
Programmer response: CHECK DATA relies on information in the index on the auxiliary table and LOB table space
being correct. To ensure that this information is correct:
1. Run CHECK LOB to check the validity of the LOB table space.
2. Run either REBUILD INDEX or CHECK INDEX to ensure that the auxiliary index is valid.
3. Run CHECK DATA.

DSNU830I csect-name - INDEX= index-name IS IN REBUILD PENDING STATE
Explanation: If the RECOVER utility issued this message, the corresponding table space to this index was recovered
to a point in time with keyword TOCOPY, TOLOGPOINT, or TORBA. Thus, the index was placed in rebuild pending
status.
If the REBUILD INDEX utility issued this message, the index is in rebuild pending status. Either duplicate index
entries existed during the BUILD phase of the REBUILD INDEX, or invalid KEY/RIDs, which do not belong to the
partition of the cluster index, were detected. The duplicate index entries or invalid KEY/RID entries must be
resolved before starting the REBUILD INDEX utility again to rebuild the index and remove the index from rebuild
pending status.
If the REORG utility with SHRLEVEL REFERENCE or CHANGE (or -TERM UTILITY) issued this message, the index
is in rebuild pending status. During the renaming of a data set during REORG, either a data set with the source
name did not yet exist or a data set with the target name already existed.
User response: If the RECOVER or REORG utility (or -TERM UTILITY) issued this message, use the REBUILD
INDEX utility to rebuild this index.
If the REBUILD INDEX utility issued this message resolve the duplicate index entries or invalid keys and rerun the
REBUILD INDEX utility.

DSNU831I csect-name ALL INDEXES OF TABLESPACE= table space-name ARE IN REBUILD PENDING
Explanation: The RECOVER TORBA, TOLOGPOINT, or TOCOPY utility issues this message to inform the user of
the state of all indexes belonging to the recovered table space. All indexes were put in rebuild pending status to
prevent data and index inconsistency. All indexes should be rebuilt before they are used.
System action: The RECOVER utility completed successfully.
User response: Use the REBUILD utility with the ALL option to rebuild all indexes over the recovered table space.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU832I csect-name - INDEX= creator.index-name PART= partition-number IS IN REBUILD PENDING STATE
Explanation: If the RECOVER utility issued this message, one partition of a partitioned table space is being
recovered to a point in time with keyword TOCOPY, TOLOGPOINT, or TORBA. The corresponding index for that
partition was placed in rebuild pending status.
If the REBUILD INDEX utility issued this message, the index or the partition of a cluster index is in rebuild pending
status. Either duplicate index entries existed during the BUILD phase of the REBUILD INDEX or INDEX PART, or
invalid KEY/RIDs, which do not belong to the partition of the cluster index, were detected. The duplicate index
entries or invalid KEY/RID entries must be resolved before starting the REBUILD INDEX utility again to rebuild the
index and remove the index from rebuild pending status.
If the REORG utility with SHRLEVEL REFERENCE or CHANGE (or -TERM UTILITY) issued this message, one
partition of a partitioned index was placed in rebuild pending status. During the renaming of a data set during
REORG, either a data set with the source name did not yet exist or a data set with the target name already existed.
User response: If the RECOVER or REORG utility (or -TERM UTILITY) issued the message, rebuild this index with
the REBUILD INDEX utility.

DSNU862I DISPLAY AVAILABLE UTILITIES. MAP: bit-map
Explanation: This message is the end-result of a DIAGNOSE DISPLAY AVAILABLE control statement. It displays
the utilities that are available on this subsystem. The message contains a machine-readable bit-map, and precedes a
table of utility names. They are two representations of the same information. An available utility is represented by
the utility name that appears in the table and a "1" in the corresponding bit position in the bit-map. An unavailable
utility is represented by a blank table entry and a "0" in the corresponding bit position in the bit-map.
Utilities may be unavailable if separately-priced features JDB771K and/or JDB771M are not installed, or installed
improperly.
The table position and bit position are fixed for any given utility, and maintenance cannot alter them. Bit positions
correspond to table entries when you read the table across each row, left to right, starting with the top row. For
example, bit 1 corresponds to CATMAINT, bit 2 to CHECK, and bit 9 to OPTIONS.
The following example shows the partial output of this message. Due to space constraints, the sample has been
truncated and broken into two rows. The actual table contains eight columns of identity names, and will display all
eight columns horizontally across:

SYSTABLES and SYSTABLEPART failed. Processing continues normally. However, those columns for the rows being
updated now contain invalid values. Subsequent utility processing ignores these values, and the next setting or
resetting of check pending for that table space corrects the error in one of the following ways:
v If the table space is set to check pending and the catalog fields are in error, the scope of check pending is escalated
in the catalog. (The STATUS column of SYSTABLESPACE is set to 'P', and the CHECKFLAG and CHECKRID
columns of SYSTABLES and SYSTABLEPART are set to 'C' and binary zeros.)
v If the table space is set to not check pending and the catalog fields are in error, the scope of check pending is set
off in the catalog. (The STATUS column of SYSTABLESPACE is set to an 'A', and the CHECKFLAG and
CHECKRID columns of SYSTABLES and SYSTABLEPART are set to blanks.)
After the catalog fields are corrected, the setting or resetting of check pending continues as specified.
Usually message DSNT500I or DSNT501I is also issued, because the probable cause of the error is RESOURCE
UNAVAILABLE. If the reason for the failure was not RESOURCE UNAVAILABLE, an SVC dump is requested and
processing continues normally. To determine the cause of the failure, refer to the dump listing.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v SYSPRINT output, including JCL, for the application program or batch job, and system messages that were issued.
Make sure that MSGLEVEL=(1,1) on the JOB statement so that all diagnostic information is sent to SYSPRINT.

DSNU973I csect-name CHECK PENDING, AUX CHECK PENDING OR BOTH HAS BEEN RESET FOR TABLESPACE database-name.tablespace-name CORRELATION-ID correlation-identifier CONNECTION-ID connection-identifier LUW-ID luw-identifier
Explanation: This message is sent to the console when CHECK pending, auxiliary CHECK pending or both states
were reset for the tablespace-name table space. The CORRELATION-ID correlation-identifier is the correlation identifier
of the thread requesting that the CHECK pending state, the auxiliary CHECK pending state or both states be reset.
Correlation IDs beginning with '0nn', where nn is a number from 01 to 28, identify system agents. The
CONNECTION-ID connection-identifier is the correlation identifier of the thread. The LUW-ID luw-identifier is the
logical-unit-of-work identifier of the thread. If the LUW-ID is an '*', the thread has no LUW-ID. If it is not an '*', the
value is a logical-unit-of-work-id that is assigned to the thread followed by an '=' sign and a token value, which can
be used in place of the logical-unit-of-work-id in any DB2 command that accepts a logical-unit-of-work-id as input.

DSNU1034I csect-name - primary-secondary SPACE units quantity TOO LARGE FOR DATA SET name
Explanation: The TEMPLATE PRIMARY or SECONDARY SPACE quantity indicated is too large. It is not possible to
dynamically allocate a data set larger than 16 777 215 units.
System action: Utility processing for the current object halts. If a list is being processed, utility processing of the
next object will proceed or halt based on the OPTIONS ITEMERROR control statement. By default, execution will
HALT.
User response: The DB2-calculated required space is too large to be dynamically allocated in the units shown. If the
primary allocation is too large, use the PCTPRIME keyword to reduce the primary and increase the secondary. If the
secondary allocation is too large, use the NBRSECND keyword to increase the number of secondary allocations. It is
not possible to use TEMPLATE dynamic allocation for data sets larger than 16(16 777 215) MB. If an object requires
a data set of this size it must be processed individually using a DD card, not a template.

DSNU1036I csect-name - UNABLE TO ESTIMATE SPACE REQUIREMENTS FOR dataset-use
Explanation: While processing a TEMPLATE control statement which does not include a SPACE keyword, DB2
could not calculate the default data set size. DB2 bases default calculations on the size of existing data sets. In this
situation, DB2 could not determine the size of existing data sets because one or more of those existing data sets are:
v in-stream data sets,
v members of partitioned data sets,
v on tape,
v or results sets generated by DECLARE CURSOR executed with an EXEC SQL utility statement.
System action: DB2 halts utility processing for the current object. If the utility is processing a list of objects, utility
processing of the next object will proceed or halt based on the OPTIONS ITEMERROR control statement. By default,
processing will HALT.
User response: Add the SPACE keyword and its operands to the TEMPLATE control statement in error and rerun
the utility. If the utility is the LOAD utility, you must add SPACE keywords for all TEMPLATE control statements
referenced in the LOAD, except for the input data set.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1037I csect-name - PREVIEW PROCESSING CONTINUES DUE TO JCL PARAMETER
Explanation: An OPTIONS utility control statement has attempted to turn off PREVIEW processing. PREVIEW

for every partition.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1129I csect-name - PARTITION RANGE NOT CONTIGUOUS - REBALANCE IGNORED
Explanation: The partition range that was specified on a REORG REBALANCE does not represent a set of
contiguous logical partitions. Due to a series of ALTER TABLE ADD PART and ALTER TABLE ROTATE PART
statements, the physical partition numbers do not match the logical partition numbers.
The physical partition numbers that were specified as the REORG partition range do not represent a contiguous set
of logical partitions. For example, physical partitions 1 and 2 might represent logical partitions 2 and 4.
System action: The REORG terminates with return code 8.
User response: Use the DISPLAY DATABASE command to identify a range of physical partition numbers that
represent a contiguous set of logical partitions, and resubmit the REORG REBALANCE while specifying that physical
partition range. Alternatively, omit the partition range on the REORG REBALANCE so that the entire table space is
reorganized.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1130I csect-name - NOT ALL PARTITIONS POPULATED BY REBALANCE - PROCESSING TERMINATES
Explanation: The table space that is being reorganized has many rows with duplicate partitioning key values, and

activated. The LOAD statement will not be generated for the indicated table.
System action: The UNLOAD job will continue.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU1204I DUPLICATE ROWS MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNLOADED
Explanation: The image copy contains duplicate pages. All rows from the duplicate pages are unloaded
System action: Processing continues.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU1211I csect-name - INPUT DATA SET IS NOT AN IMAGE COPY
Explanation: The input data set specified by the FROMCOPY or FROMCOPYDDN option of the UNLOAD utility
was not identified as an image copy data set.
System action: The utility job terminates.
User response: Specify the correct image copy data set name to the FROMCOPY option, or to the DD-name that is
referred to by the FROMCOPYDDN option.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1212I csect-name - INVALID FIELD NAME field-name FOR TABLE table-name
Explanation: The specified field name in the field specification list of the UNLOAD utility is:
v Not a column name of the specified table, or
v An existing column name for the CONSTANT option.
The field name is not valid.
System action: The utility job terminates.
User response: For a CONSTANT field, specify a non-existing field name. Otherwise, specify the field name as a
column name of the indicated table.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1213I csect-name - INVALID FIELD TYPE FOR FIELD field-name FOR TABLE table-name
Explanation: The specified field type in the field specification list of the UNLOAD utility is incompatible with the
base type of the corresponding column of the table.
System action: The utility job terminates.
User response: Specify only a compatible type allowed for the unload operation in the field specification list.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1214I csect-name - INVALID FIELD POSITION SPECIFICATION FOR FIELD field-name, TABLE table-name
Explanation: For a UNLOAD statement, specified field positions are not in ascending order in the field specification
list of the indicated table.
System action: The utility job terminates.
User response: Specify the field positions in the ascending order in the field specification list. If a certain order of
the output fields is needed, change the order of the field in the list so that the field positions are in the ascending
order.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1217I csect-name - CONFLICTING FIELD POSITION AND/OR LENGTH SPECIFICATION FOR FIELD field-name, TABLE table-name
Explanation: For a UNLOAD statement, the specified field position for the indicated field caused a conflict with the
previous field. This is caused either by
v The position value specified for the field is too small.
v The length specification for the previous field is too large.
System action: The utility job terminates.
User response: Specify the correct position or length parameters in the field specification list so that there are
enough space for the output fields.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1218I csect-name - LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH OF OUTPUT RECORD EXCEEDED THE LIMIT FOR TABLE table-name
Explanation: The maximum length of the output records exceeded the physical limit for the UNLOAD utility.
System action: The utility job terminates.
User response: Consider one or more of the following options that can reduce the length of the output record, if
possible:
v Use the NOPAD option.
v Unload only the necessary fields using the field specification options.
v Specify the LENGTH option with TRUNCATE and/or STRIP options for the applicable fields.
If the above options can not be applied, you will have to use an application to unload the data from the table.
Problem determination: This problem will most likely occur when BLOB, CLOB, or DBCLOB columns are selected
from a table to be unloaded.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1219I csect-name - THE NUMBER OF RECORDS IN ERROR REACHED THE LIMIT nnnn
Explanation: For the UNLOAD utility, the number of records in error reached the specified MAXERR limit.
System action: The utility job terminates.
User response: Investigate the individual error message and determine the cause of the errors. The corrective action
will differ by the type of the error. In certain situations, this condition may be anticipated. In this case, the total
number of records unloaded before the job terminates can be adjusted by changing the MAXERR option value.
Problem determination: This problem will occur when the number of errors in the output record formatting,
including data conversion errors, detected by the UNLOAD utility reached the limit specified by the MAXERR
option. For each record in error, the corresponding message has been issued. The records in error will not be
unloaded to the output data set. This message is issued only once, even though there can be a situation in which the
number of individual error messages exceeds the specified MAXERR value. This situation occurs only when the
UNLOAD utility is running in the partition parallel mode and the multiple tasks have reached the MAXERR value
concurrently.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1220I UNLOAD OF lob-or-xml FROM IMAGE COPY NOT SUPPORTED
Explanation: For the UNLOAD utility, one or more XML, BLOB, CLOB, and/or DBCLOB columns are selected on
the indicated table when the source object is an image copy data set.
System action: The utility job terminates.
User response: Specify a field selection list that does not include any XML, BLOB, CLOB, or DBCLOB column from
the indicated table.
Problem determination: When the source object of the UNLOAD utility is an image copy, selection of a LOB or
XML column is not supported.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1221I csect-name - UNLDDN IS NOT SPECIFIED OR SPECIFIED TEMPLATE template-name IS INVALID FOR MULTIPLE TABLE SPACES
Explanation: For the UNLOAD utility, the output data set specification is invalid when the source objects consist of
multiple table spaces.
System action: The utility job terminates.
User response: Include an appropriate TEMPLATE statement in the unload job step that contains the table space
name as a variable. If the table space is selected from different databases, the database name must also be included as
a variable. Specify the template name to the UNLDDN option.
Problem determination: When the source objects of the UNLOAD utility consist of multiple table spaces, an output
data set corresponding to each table space is required.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1222I csect-name - TEMPLATE template-name SPECIFIED FOR PUNCHDDN IS INVALID FOR MULTIPLE TABLE SPACES
Explanation: For the UNLOAD utility, the specification of output data set to store the generated LOAD statement is
invalid when the source objects consist of multiple table spaces.
System action: The utility job terminates.
User response: Include an appropriate TEMPLATE statement in the unload job step that contains the table space
name as a variable. If the table space is selected from different databases, the database name must also be included as
a variable. Specify the template name to the PUNCHDDN option. The TEMPLATE should be different from the one
used for UNLDDN.
Problem determination: When the source objects of the UNLOAD utility consist of multiple table spaces, an output
data set corresponding to each table space is required.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1223I csect-name - TABLESPACE SPECIFICATION IS MISSING FOR FROMCOPY OR FROMCOPYDDN
Explanation: For the UNLOAD utility, the FROMCOPY or FROMCOPYDDN option is used but the TEMPLATE
specification is missing.
System action: The utility job terminates.
User response: Add the TABLESPACE option in the UNLOAD statement to specify the table space name of the
image copy.
Problem determination: When the source objects of the UNLOAD utility is an image copy, the TABLESPACE option
is required to specify the table space name of the image copy.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1224I csect-name - TABLE table-name IS NOT IN THE TABLE SPACE table-space-name
Explanation: The indicated table-name given in a FROM TABLE option is not in the table space specified by the
TABLESPACE option.
System action: The utility job terminates.
User response: Correct either the TABLESPACE or the FROM TABLE specification to select a table in the specified
table space. If the table was dropped, remove the FROM TABLE option for the dropped table.
Problem determination: There is an unmatch between the TABLESPACE and FROM TABLE specifications or the
specified table was dropped. Dropped tables are not supported by the UNLOAD utility.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1225I csect-name - TABLESPACE KEYWORD IS NOT SPECIFIED. AT LEAST ONE FROM TABLE SPECIFICATION IS REQUIRED.
Explanation: There is no TABLESPACE nor FROM TABLE specification in a UNLOAD statement. The source object
for unloading can not be identified.
System action: The utility job terminates.
User response: If the TABLESPACE specification is omitted, specify at least one FROM TABLE option to identify the
source object. Instead of a TABLESPACE specification, the LIST option can be used, if a LISTDEF statement defines a
list of objects. When the LIST option is used, the FROM TABLE option can not be specified.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1226I csect-name - THE NUMBER OF OBJECTS IS TOO LARGE
Explanation: The number of source objects for the UNLOAD utility is too large. Overflow in some of the internal
data structures occurred.
System action: The utility job terminates.
User response: Divide the UNLOAD job step into two or more job steps and, in each job step, use a LISTDEF that
expands to less number of objects.
Problem determination: This problem will most likely occur when the LIST option is used and the corresponding
LISTDEF definition is expanded to a large number of objects.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1227I csect-name - THE CONTENT OF THE IMAGE COPY DATA SET IS INCONSISTENT WITH TABLE SPACE table-space
Explanation: For the UNLOAD utility, the data set that is specified by the FROMCOPY or the FROMCOPYDDN
option references a data set that does not match the definition of the table space in the catalog.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
table-space
Name of the table space.
System action: The utility job terminates.
User response: Specify a correct image copy data set name for the table space, or specify the correct table space
name for the image copy.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1228I csect-name - A ROWID COLUMN column-name, TABLE table-name IS SELECTED FOR UNLOAD BUT THE PAGE SET HEADER PAGE IS MISSING IN THE SPECIFIED IMAGE COPY DATA SET
Explanation: For the UNLOAD utility, a ROWID column is selected for unloading from an image copy, but the
required information to form the ROWID can not be retrieved because the page set header page is not included in
the specified image copy data set.
System action: The utility job terminates.
User response: Use the FROMCOPYDDN, instead of FROMCOPY, to specify a DD name where the first piece of
copy that contain the page set header page is concatenated to the source image copy data set.
Problem determination: The problem will most likely occur when a piece of copy data set, not the first one, is
specified to the FROMCOPY option.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1229I csect-name - ERROR IN LOADING DICTIONARY FOR TABLE SPACE table-space
Explanation: For the UNLOAD utility, an error was detected in loading the dictionary for decompression while
reading an image copy data set.
System action: The utility job terminates.
User response: If the right image copy data set is specified to the FROMCOPY or FROMCOPYDDN, it will be
required to take a new image copy for the table space by running the COPY utility or using other alternative
methods.
Problem determination: Possibly the image copy data set is corrupted.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1230I csect-name - INCONSISTENT STRIP CHAR LENGTH FOR FIELD field-name, TABLE table-name
Explanation: An invalid strip character was specified for the indicated field of the table.
System action: The utility job terminates.
User response: Specify the correct strip character applicable to the field.
Problem determination: For an SBCS or MIXED character field, the strip character, if specified, must be an SBCS
character; for a DBCS field, it must be a DBCS character.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1231I csect-name - LENGTH OF OUTPUT RECORD IS TOO LONG FOR TABLE table-name
Explanation: An output record for the indicated table exceeded the physical limit.
System action: The record in error will not be unloaded to the output data set. The UNLOAD utility continues until
the total number of records in error reaches the value specified by the MAXERR option (the default is 1).
If the total number of records reaches the MAXERR value, the UNLOAD utility issues the DSNU1219I message and
terminates with the return code 8.
User response: Consider the following options to reduce the size of the output records:
v Unload only the necessary fields using the field specification options.
v Specify the LENGTH option with TRUNCATE and/or STRIP options for the applicable fields.
If the above options can not be applied, you will have to use an application to unload the data from the table.
Problem determination: This message is issued only when the NOPAD option is specified in the UNLOAD
statement and most likely when BLOB, CLOB, or DBCLOB columns are selected for unload from the table. It is also
possible that, if the expansion of output strings occurs due to the encoding scheme specified for the output, the total
length of some output records becomes longer than expected.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU1232I csect-name - COMPRESSED ROW IS IGNORED BECAUSE THE DICTIONARY IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR TABLE table-name
Explanation: The UNLOAD utility encountered a compressed row when unloading the data from an image copy
data set, but the dictionary for decompression has not been loaded for the table space.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
table-name
The name of the table.
This message is issued when:
v A copy of pieces (not the first piece) of a compressed table space is specified in the FROMCOPY or
FROMCOPYDDN option of the UNLOAD utility.
v The image copy data set in the FROMCOPY or FROMCOPYDDN option of the UNLOAD utility was built either
by the COPY utility with the SYSTEMPAGES NO option or by the DSN1COPY utility, and the original compressed
table space was filled by INSERT statements and never reorganized.
System action: The record in error is not unloaded to the output data set. The UNLOAD utility continues to unload
records until the total number of records in error reaches the value specified by the MAXERR option. (The default
value of this option is 1.) If the total number of records reaches the MAXERR value, the UNLOAD utility issues
message DSNU1219I and terminates with return code 8.
User response: To unload compressed rows from the copy of pieces, use the FROMCOPYDDN option to specify a
DD name under which the first copy of pieces that contains the compression dictionary is concatenated.
If the problem persists, it is likely that the image copy data set was built in such a way that the data in the image
copy data set cannot be unloaded. (Either the COPY utility was used with the SYSTEMPAGES NO option or the
DSN1COPY utility was used, and the original compressed table space was filled by INSERT statements and never
reorganized.)
This copy is not suitable for use with the UNLOAD utility. Create a new copy with the SYSTEMPAGES YES option
and unload data from the new copy.

DSNU1233I csect-name - DATA IS TOO LONG FOR FIELD field-name, TABLE table-name
Explanation: The space for the field in an output record is not large enough to unload the data from the
corresponding column of a row in the indicated table.
If you are trying to unload tables in spanned record format, one or more of the source tables might not have LOB or
XML columns.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
field-name
The name of the field.
table-name
The name of the table.
System action: The record in error is not unloaded to the output data set. The UNLOAD utility continues until the
total number of records in error reaches the value that is specified by the MAXERR option. The default MAXERR
value is 1.
If the total number of records in error reaches the MAXERR value, UNLOAD issues message DSNU1219I and
terminates with the return code 8.
User response: Take one of the following actions:
v If you received this message when trying to unload tables in spanned record format, ensure that all of the tables
in the FROM TABLE clauses have at least one LOB or XML column. Use a separate UNLOAD statement for those
tables that do not have LOB or XML columns.
v Apply appropriate values to the LENGTH or POSITION parameters in the field specification list to accommodate
the data in the output records.
v Specify the TRUNCATE option for the field, if applicable.
v If the data contains leading or trailing blanks, specify the STRIP option to reduce the length of the data.

DSNU1234I csect-name - NUMERIC CONVERSION ERROR OCCURRED FOR FIELD field-name, TABLE table-name
Explanation: The UNLOAD utility encountered an error when it tried to convert a data of one numeric type to
another.
System action: The record in error will not be unloaded to the output data set. The UNLOAD utility continues until
the total number of records in error reaches the value specified by the MAXERR option (the default is 1).
If the total number of records reaches the MAXERR value, the UNLOAD utility issues the DSNU1219I message and
terminates with the return code 8.
User response: To eliminate any numeric overflow error, specify the same numeric data type for the output as the
base type of the columns in the table. Convert numeric types only when it is known that the range of the source data
fits in the allowable range of the specified numeric type for the output.
Problem determination: This message is issued most likely when an overflow occurs in converting a data of one
numeric type to another. For example, an attempt to convert an INTEGER 32768 to a SMALL INT causes an
overflow.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU1235I csect-name - CCSID SUBSTITUTION IS ATTEMPTED WITH NOSUBS OPTION FOR FIELD field-name, TABLE table-name
Explanation: While the UNLOAD utility is running with the NOSUBS option, a CCSID substitution is attempted in
the CCSID conversion process for the indicated field.
System action: The record in error will not be unloaded to the output data set. The UNLOAD utility continues until
the total number of records in error reaches the value specified by the MAXERR option (the default is 1). If the total
number of records reaches the MAXERR value, the UNLOAD utility issues the DSNU1219I message and terminates
with the return code 8.
User response: If CCSID substitution should not occur, specify an appropriate CCSID that has the corresponding
entries to the original CCSID, if available. To allow the default CCSID substitution, remove the NOSUBS option.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU1236I csect-name - POSITION SPECIFICATION CAUSES FIELD OVERLAP FOR FIELD field-name, TABLE table-name
Explanation: For the UNLOAD utility, the space for an output field was overlapped by the indicated field to which
the POSITION parameter is specified.
System action: The record in error will not be unloaded to the output data set. The UNLOAD utility continues until
the total number of records in error reaches the value specified by the MAXERR option (the default is 1). If the total
number of records reaches the MAXERR value, the UNLOAD utility issues the DSNU1219I message and terminates
with the return code 8.
User response: Consider the following options to eliminate this situation:
v Remove the POSITION specifications from the field specification list.
v Adjust the POSITION parameter for the field to preserve enough space for the previous fields.
v Adjust the LENGTH, possibly with the TRUNCATE option, of the previous fields, if applicable.
Problem determination: This message will be issued only when the NOPAD option is specified in the UNLOAD
statement. The POSITION specification for the field caused a conflict with the positioning and/or the length of a
previous field.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU1237I csect-name - ERROR IN CCSID CONVERSION FOR FIELD field-name, TABLE table-name
Explanation: The CCSID conversion process detected a code point or form exception while the UNLOAD utility
was running.
System action: The record in error will not be unloaded to the output data set. The UNLOAD utility continues until
the total number of records in error reaches the value specified by the MAXERR option (the default is 1). If the total
number of records reaches the MAXERR value, the UNLOAD utility issues the DSNU1219I message and terminates
with the return code 8.
System programmer response: Verify the contents of SYSSTRINGS. If necessary, insert a row into SYSSTRINGS for
the conversion. For an SBCS translation, the row must contain a translate table or the name of a user-provided
translate procedure. For a DBCS translation, the row must contain the name of a user-provided translate procedure.
User response: If the specified CCSID for output is incorrect, correct the CCSID specification. If a valid CCSID is
specified, notify the system programmer.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU1238I TABLE table2 IS NOT IN SAME TABLESPACE AS TABLE table1
Explanation: All source tables for a single UNLOAD utility statement must be in the same table space.
System action: Utility processing terminates.
User response: Remove the FROM TABLE control statement that specifies table2 from the current UNLOAD request.
Create another UNLOAD utility statement that contains the FROM TABLE control statement for table2 so that all
source tables in a single UNLOAD request are from the same table space. Resubmit the job.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1239I csect-name - VERSION version-number OBDREC WAS NOT FOUND IN OBID object-id
Explanation: The version information for a record that is being unloaded from an image copy is not available in the
OBD or the system pages in the image copy.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
version-number
The version number of the record in error.
object-id
The object ID of the record in error.
Unloading data from an image copy requires that the image copy data set was taken with the SYSTEMPAGES YES
option on the COPY utility statement. Without the system pages, the UNLOAD utility cannot unload versioned data.
Possible causes for this error include:
v The system pages are not available in the image copy.
v The version 0 OBD information has been deleted by the MODIFY RECOVERY utility.
System action: The record that is in error is not unloaded to the output data set. The UNLOAD utility continues to
process records. If the total number of records in error reaches the value that is specified by the MAXERR option,
processing stops and message DSNU1219I is issued.
The default value for MAXERR is 1.
User response: If the DDL of the table, including alterations up to the time of the image copy, is available, you can
rebuild the OBD information and unload the data. To rebuild OBD information:
1. Re-create the table to the state that it was in when the image copy was taken.

Explanation: The RUNSTATS utility issues this message to report the statistics collected for the key column
keyseq-num partition part-num. If more than one keyseq-num are listed, then the statistics collected and the expression
values reported represent the concatenation of those key columns.
The value of CARDINALITY is the number of distinct values for the listed keyseq-num. This statistic appears only if
the KEYCARD option was specified.
The values under FREQUENCY are the same as those that are inserted into the DB2 catalog. Consider each frequency
as a four-digit number with an implied decimal point two places to the left of the final digit. The resulting number is
the percentage of total rows in the table that contain a particular value for the named index key columns.
Frequency is associated with the occurrence of a single value which is listed under KEYVALUE.
Frequencies for the MOST frequent values are collected by default or if the FREQVAL ... MOST options are specified
and given a COUNT value greater than zero.
Frequencies for the LEAST frequent values are collected, if the FREQVAL ... LEAST options are specified and given a
COUNT value greater than zero.
Frequencies for the MOST and LEAST frequent values are collected, if the FREQVAL ... BOTH options are specified
and given a COUNT value greater than zero.
If the default is taken, then the ten most frequently occurring values, plus the lowest and highest values in the
partition (if not already included in the ten greatest frequencies), are reported in descending order of frequency.
If fewer than ten values appear, then there are fewer than ten distinct values in the index.
If no values appear, then the values are uniformly distributed.
If frequencies appear but key column values do not, then the invoker of RUNSTATS is not authorized to read the
table. Message DSNU619I is issued to identify the table.
The message is routed to SYSPRINT.

Frequency is associated with the occurrence of a single value which is listed under KEYVALUE.
When FREQVAL...MOST and a COUNT value greater than zero are specified, or if frequent values are collected by
default, the frequencies for the most frequently occurring values are collected.
When FREQVAL...LEAST and a COUNT value greater than zero are specified, the frequencies for the least frequently
occurring values are collected.
When FREQVAL...BOTH and a COUNT value greater than zero are specified, the frequencies for the most and least

Explanation: The RUNSTATS utility issues this message to report the histogram statistics collected for the indexed
key column for each quantile, as indicated by quan-num and each partition, as indicated by part-num. If more than
one key column is listed, then the statistics collected represent the concatenation of those key columns.
When a value of 1 is specified for NUMCOLS or for default histogram processing, LOWVALUE and HIGHVALUE
represent the first key expression value low bound and high bound for each quantile range. If a value greater than 1
is specified for NUMCOLS, then the LOWVALUE and HIGHVALUE represent the concatenation of the key
expressions.
cardinality represents the number of distinctive values in each quantile. If more than one key column is listed, then
cardinality represents the number of distinctive combinations of that KEYSEQ group in each quantile.
frequency represents the percentage of rows in each quantile.
If the total number of distinctive values for that KEYSEQ, or KEYSEQ group, is less than the specified number of

DSNU1407I csect-name - MISMATCH BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF PAGES READ=count AND THE NUMBER OF PAGES ORIGINALLY COPIED=count FOR INPUT DATA SET dsname OBJECT NAME obj-type obj-qual.obj-name DSNUM n
Explanation: The COPYTOCOPY or RECOVER utility issues this message when it detects that the number of pages
read from the input image copy does not match the original number of pages copied by the COPY utility. The utility
retrieves the number of pages originally copied from the COPYPAGESF column of the SYSIBM.SYSCOPY record for
the input image copy data set.
System action: The COPYTOCOPY utility terminates processing of this object. The RECOVER utility attempts to
continue by falling back to the previous full image copy, if any. If the utility job step includes an OPTIONS control
statement with the EVENT(ITEMERROR,SKIP) option, COPYTOCOPY processes the next item in the list.
User response: Report to IBM Center. Provide output of COPYTOCOPY job, the data set referenced in the message,
and run REPORT utility on the object and provide its output.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1408I csect-name - SOURCE DATA SET dsname DOES NOT MATCH obj-type obj-qual.obj-name DSNUM n
Explanation: The COPYTOCOPY or RECOVER utility issues this message when the DBID or PSID of the source
data set does not match the DBID or PSID of the table space or index space for which the copy is made. This error
can occur if the data set was reused.
The UNLOAD utility displays this message when no records were UNLOADED from an image copy data set because
the OBID for the tables did not match the information in the DBD. This can occur if the tables in the table space were
dropped and re-created after taking the image copy.
The COPY utility issues this message when the DBID or PSID of the header page of the target object does not match
the information in the DBD. In this case, the source data set dsname will be omitted from the message.
System action: RECOVER attempts to continue processing by falling back to the previous full image copy, if any.
COPYTOCOPY searches for the next available image copy data set with the same START_RBA value as the
START_RBA value registered in SYSIBM.SYSCOPY for dsname. If COPYTOCOPY finds a data set, it uses that data
set. Otherwise, COPYTOCOPY issues message DSNU1401I.
The UNLOAD utility completes with reason-code four.
If FROMCOPY is specified, processing of this object halts. COPY fails with RC8 and an image copy is not created.
User response: Determine why the data set was reused for the image copy data set that is registered in
SYSIBM.SYSCOPY.
If FROMCOPY is specified, correct the COPYTOCOPY utility control statement. Specify a source data set that is an
image copy of the table space or index space for which you want additional image copies.
If this message was received for COPY, try to determine how the header page of the object became corrupted, and fix
it using the REPAIR utility, if possible. Otherwise, recover the object using a good copy.
If this message was received for UNLOAD, specify a source data set that is an image copy of the table space taken
with the current table definitions.
Severity: 4 (warning) or 8 (error)
DSNU1409I csect-name - ttttt ERRORS ON DATA SET NAME=dsname obj-type obj-qual.obj-name DSNUM n
Explanation: DB2 detected I/O errors on the named object. ttttt is either 'READ' or 'WRITE'.
System action: If FROMCOPY is specified, processing is terminated. Otherwise, processing will continue. The utility
will attempt to use the next available image copy data set that matches COPYTOCOPY job specification with the
same START_ RBA as the data set named in error. If it fails to find one, processing of this object is terminated.
User response: An IOS (I/O subsystem) message might be included on the MVS console SYSLOG indicating the
type of I/O error that occurred. If an IOS message was issued, follow the Problem Determination directions for the
message.
Severity: 4 (warning)
DSNU1410I csect-name - INCREMENTAL IMAGE COPY DISALLOWED FOR obj-type obj-qual.obj-name DSNUM n.  FULL IMAGE COPY WILL BE USED
Explanation: An incremental image copy is disallowed for the specified object type. The utility ignores the request,
and creates a full image copy if available.
System action: The system treats the request to copy an incremental image copy as a request to copy a full image
copy.
User response: The capacity of the target image copy data set may not be sufficient if its size was established
assuming an incremental image copy. If this condition occurs, halt the utility and resubmit the job step with the
appropriate size.

Explanation: A full recovery was requested, but because the object is not a logged object, it was recovered to its last
recoverable point, which means that any changes made to the object after the recoverable point are lost. This message
warns that the object has been modified since the last recoverable point.
A recoverable point is established when one of the following circumstances is true:
v When a table space is altered from LOGGED to NOT LOGGED, which alters all of the index spaces for indexes on
all of the tables in the table space
v When an image copy is taken against a not logged table space or a not logged index space

DSNU1507I csect-name: THE IMAGE COPY FOR obj-type obj-qual.obj-name IS NOT USABLE. RECOVERY BY FALLBACK TO THE PREVIOUS IMAGE COPY IS NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE REQUIRED LOG RECORDS WERE NOT WRITTEN
Explanation: DB2 cannot use the identified image copy. DB2 cannot recover by falling back to the previous image
copy and applying log records. Some required log records for object-qualifier.object-name were not written because
object-qualifier.object-name had the NOT LOGGED attribute.
System action: Utility processing halts for this object. The utility job completes with a return code of 8.
If the utility job step includes an OPTIONS control statement with the EVENT(ITEMERROR,SKIP) option, the utility
will process the next item in the list.
User response: Check the utility job output for prior messages indicating an allocation, open, or read error on the

DSNU1508I csect-name RECOVERY OF obj-type obj-qual.obj-name IS NOT ALLOWED TO A NOT LOGGED POINT
Explanation: The object has the LOGGED attribute specified, but the TORBA, TOLOGPOINT, TOCOPY,
TOLASTCOPY, TOLASTFULLCOPY option identifies a point when the object had the NOT LOGGED attribute. This
is not allowed because the current logging attribute of the object must match the logging attribute of the object at the
time of the chose recovery point.
System action: If OPTIONS EVENT(ITEMERROR,SKIP) has been specified for the job step, then processing
continues for the other objects in the list. Otherwise, recovery processing terminates.
User response: Alter the logging attribute of the object to NOT LOGGED, then resubmit the RECOVER utility job.

DSNU1512I csect-name RECOVERY OF A SINGLE PIECE OF obj-type obj-qual.obj-name IS NOT ALLOWED TO A DIFFERENT ROW FORMAT
Explanation: You attempted to recover a single piece of a multi-piece nonpartitioned table space to a point in time
in which the rows are in a different format than the current format. For example, this error can occur when a table
space is in reordered row format and you attempted to recover a piece of the table space to a point in time when the
table space was in basic row format.
System action: The RECOVER utility terminates.
Programmer response: To recover the data, you can do one of the following actions:
v Recover the entire table space rather than a single piece.
v Recover the piece to a point-in-time when the table space is in the same row format.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1513I csect-name RECOVER OF obj-type obj-qual.obj-name WITH A VALIDPROC IS NOT ALLOWED TO A DIFFERENT ROW FORMAT
Explanation: You cannot recover an object that requires the recovery of part or all of a table with varying-length
columns and a VALIDPROC when the RECOVER is one of the following types:
v From a point in time when the table space was in reordered row format to a point in time when the table space
was in basic row format
v From a point in time when the table space was in basic row format to a point in time when the table space was in
reordered row format.
System action: The RECOVER utility terminates.
Programmer response: To recover the object, you can execute the following steps:
1. ALTER the VALIDPROC to null on all tables that are part of the object to be recovered.
2. RECOVER the object.
3. Make any necessary changes to the VALIDPROCs so that the VALIDPROCs are in sync with the current format of
the row.
4. ALTER ADD the VALIDPROCs to the tables.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1519I csect-name INVALID SPECIFICATION OF RESTOREBEFORE X'xxxxxxxxxxxx'
Explanation: This message is issued for one of the following reasons:
v The LRSN or RBA value that was specified for the RESTOREBEFORE parameter is greater than the LRSN or RBA
value that was specified for the TOLOGPOINT or TORBA parameter. The RESTOREBEFORE value determines the
ending point of the search for image copies to restore. Therefore, the RESTOREBEFORE value must be less than
the LRSN or RBA value that was specified for the TOLOGPOINT option. The RESTOREBEFORE value must also
be less than the RBA value that was specified for the TORBA option.
v RECOVER did not find an image copy, concurrent copy, or system-level backup with a START RBA, START LRSN,
or DATA COMPLETE LRSN value that is lower than the value that was specified for the RESTOREBEFORE
parameter.
X'xxxxxxxxxxxx'
The LRSN or RBA value that was specified for the RESTOREBEFORE parameter.
System action: The RECOVER utility terminates processing.
User response: Take one of the following actions:
v Examine the RECOVER control statement. Modify the RESTOREBEFORE parameter value to be less than the
TOLOGPOINT or TORBA parameter value. Resubmit the job.
v Run REPORT RECOVERY. In the output, examine image copy, concurrent copy, and system-level backup
information for the objects that are being recovered. Find START RBA, START LRSN, or DATA COMPLETE LRSN
in the output. These values indicate the first RBA or LRSN value after each copy was taken. Change the
RESTOREBEFORE value in the RECOVER control statement to be higher than the smallest START RBA, START
LRSN, or DATA COMPLETE LRSN value that you find in the REPORT RECOVERY output. Resubmit the job.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1520I THE RECOVERY BASE FOR obj-type obj-qual.obj-name dsnum n IS THE SYSTEM-LEVEL BACKUP WITH DATE = yyyymmdd, TIME = hhmmss, AND TOKEN = X byte-string
Explanation: This message is issued by the RECOVER Utility in the RESTORE phase when a system-level backup
has been chosen as the recovery base for the identified object.
System programmer response: Recovery processing continues.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU1521I csect-name A LOGONLY RECOVERY CANNOT BE DONE BECAUSE THE HEADER PAGE CANNOT BE ACCESSED FOR obj-type obj-qual.obj-name dsnum n
Explanation: The header page could not be read. DB2 stops the RECOVER utility from proceeding with a
LOGONLY recovery because the starting point is unavailable.
System programmer response: REMOVE the LOGONLY keyword from the RECOVER utility statement and recover
the object by using an image copy along with a log.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1522I THE DFSMSHSM CALL TO RESTORE obj-type obj-qual.obj-name dsnum n FAILED WITH RC = X'hsm-rc' and REASON CODE = X'hsm-rsc'. SEE THE JOB LOG FOR DFSMSHSM MESSAGES INDICATING THE CAUSE OF THE ERROR
Explanation: This message is issued by the RECOVER utility when the call to DFSMShsm to restore the data sets for
the object from a system-level backup failed with the return code and reason code indicated in the message. The
HSM job log will contain error messages issued by DFSMShsm that indicate the cause of the error.
System action: If OPTIONS EVENT(ITEMERROR,SKIP) was specified, the recovery of this object will be skipped
and the recovery of the other objects in the list will continue. Otherwise, the RECOVER utility will terminate.
System programmer response: Review the RECOVER utility job output and, in particular, the DFSMShsm messages
in the HSM job log to determine the cause of the failure. If the restore of the data sets failed due to target volume
connectivity problems or hardware failures, the system storage administrator should be contacted to resolve the
problem. After the problem is resolved, you can run the RECOVER utility job again.
If the problem with the system-level backup cannot be resolved, you can consider these recovery options to bypass
the problem:
v RECOVER with the RESTOREBEFORE option to direct the recovery to find a recovery base prior to the
system-level backup that has the problem. More log apply processing will be needed during the recovery of the
object.
v RECOVER with the FROMDUMP option (or specify YES for the RESTORE/RECOVER FROM DUMP installation
option on installation panel DSNTIP6) to direct the recovery to use a copy of the system-level backup that had
been dumped to tape.
v Specify SYSTEM-LEVEL BACKUPS as NO on installation panel DSNTIP6 to avoid choosing system-level backups
as a recovery base.
Problem determination: The DFSMShsm message(s) appearing in the HSM job log will indicate the cause of the
failure.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1523I THE DFSMSHSM ARCXTRCT MACRO INVOCATION ISSUED BY THE RECOVER UTILITY FAILED WITH RC = X'hsm-rc'
Explanation: The RECOVER utility attempted to call the DFSMShsm ARCXTRCT macro, but the invocation failed.
hsm-rc The return code from DFSMShsm.
RECOVER calls the ARCXTRCT macro to retrieve information for system-level backups for the database copy pool
when the SYSTEM_LEVEL_BACKUPS subsystem parameter is set to YES.
System action: The RECOVER utility terminates.
System programmer response: Ensure that the HSM address space is active.
If you need help determining why the ARCXTRCT macro failed, call IBM Software Support for help with
DFSMShsm.

DSNU1524I obj-type obj-qual.obj-name dsnum n CANNOT BE RESTORED FROM THE SYSTEM LEVEL BACKUP WITH DATE = yyyymmdd, TIME = hhmmss, AND TOKEN = X 'byte-string' BECAUSE THE SPECIFIED DUMPCLASS hsm-dumpclass-nm IS NOT KNOWN TO DFSMSHSM
Explanation: This message is issued by the RECOVER Utility when the DFSMShsm dumpclass does not exist for the
system-level backup that has been chosen as the recovery base for the identified object. The DFSMShsm dump class
name can be specified on the RECOVER statement via the FROMDUMP DUMPCLASS(hsm-dumpclass-nm) options, or
on installation panel DSNTIP6 by specifying RESTORE/RECOVER From dump => YES and DUMP CLASS NAME
=> hsm-dumpclass-nm.
System action: If OPTIONS EVENT(ITEMERROR,SKIP) was specified, then the recovery of this object will be
skipped and the recovery of the other objects in the list will continue. Otherwise, the RECOVER Utility will
terminate.
System programmer response: Issue the DFSMShsm LIST COPYPOOL command with the ALLVOLS option for the
DB2 database copy pool. Analyze the output from the LIST COPYPOOL ALLVOLS command to see which dump
classes exist for the system-level backup identified by the token. Correct the dump class specification on the
RECOVER statement or on installation panel DSNTIP6, and rerun the RECOVER.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1525I obj-type obj-qual.obj-name dsnum n CANNOT BE RESTORED VIA FLASHCOPY FROM THE SYSTEM-LEVEL BACKUP WITH DATE = yyyymmdd, TIME = hhmmss, AND TOKEN = X byte-string
Explanation: The RECOVER Utility has determined that the system-level backup chosen as the recovery base for the
identified object either has not completed the background copy or does not reside on DASD, so the identified object
cannot be restored via FlashCopy.
System action: If OPTIONS EVENT(ITEMERROR,SKIP) was specified, then the recovery of this object will be
skipped and the recovery of the other objects in the list will continue, otherwise the RECOVER Utility will terminate.
System programmer response: Issue the DFSMShsm LIST COPYPOOL command with the ALLVOLS option for the
DB2 database copy pool. Analyze the output from the LIST COPYPOOL command to see whether the system-level
backup identified by the token is recoverable. If the system-level backup no longer resides on DASD and has been
dumped to tape, then rerun the RECOVER specifying the FROMDUMP option.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1526I obj-type obj-qual.obj-name dsnum n CANNOT BE RESTORED FROM THE SYSTEM-LEVEL BACKUP WITH TOKEN = X byte-string BECAUSE DFSMSHSM HAS NO RECORD OF THE SYSTEM-LEVEL BACKUP
Explanation: The RECOVER Utility has chosen the identified system-level backup as the recovery base for this
object, but DFSMShsm has no record of a system-level backup with this particular token.
System action: If OPTIONS EVENT(ITEMERROR,SKIP) was specified, then the recovery of this object will be
skipped and the recovery of the other objects in the list will continue, otherwise the RECOVER Utility will terminate.
System programmer response: Issue the DFSMShsm LIST COPYPOOL command with the ALLVOLS option for the
DB2 database copy pool. Run the Print Log Map Utility (DSNJU004) to print the system-level backup information. If
data sharing, ensure that the system-level backup information from all members is gathered. Locate the systemlevel
backup information in the DSNJU004 output and compare it with the output from the LIST COPYPOOL command.
DFSMShsm cannot be used as a recovery base because it has no record of the system-level backup.
The RESTOREBEFORE option may be specified on the RECOVER statement to direct the recovery to choose a
recovery base that is older than the identified system-level backup, or SYSTEM-LEVEL BACKUPS => NO can be
specified on installationation panel DSNTIP6 to avoid using system-level backups as a recovery base.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1527I obj-type obj-qual.obj-name dsnum n WAS SUCCESSFULLY RESTORED FROM A slb-type, ELAPSED TIME = hh:mm:ss
Explanation: The object was successfully restored from a system-level backup via FlashCopy or from a system-level
backup that was dumped to tape. slb-type will be FLASHCOPY for the former and DUMP COPY for the latter.
System action: Recovery processing continues.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSNU1528I obj-type obj-qual.obj-name dsnum n CANNOT USE THE SYSTEM-LEVEL BACKUP WITH DATE = yyyymmdd, TIME = hhmmss AND TOKEN = X byte-string AS A RECOVERY BASE
Explanation: This message is issued by the RECOVER utility for a point-in-time recovery when a system-level
backup was chosen as the recovery base for an object. However, it cannot be used for the restore because one of the
following utilities was executed on the object after the creation of the system-level backup:
v REORG TABLESPACE
v REORG INDEX
v REBUILD INDEX
v LOAD REPLACE
v RECOVER (from an image copy)
This restriction exists because the underlying data sets for the object might have been moved to different DASD
volumes during the execution of these utilities. DFSMShsm requires that the data sets for an object must remain on
the same DASD volume(s) to be correctly restored from the system-level backup.
System action: If OPTIONS EVENT(ITEMERROR,SKIP) was specified, the recovery of this object will be skipped
and the recovery of the other objects in the list will continue. Otherwise, the RECOVER utility will terminate.
System programmer response: Refer to the DB2 Utilities Guide and Reference for a discussion of RECOVER utility
constraints.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1530I csect-name - OBSOLETE OR NFM DB2 CATALOG OR DIRECTORY OBJECT object-type object-qualifier.object-name WILL NOT BE PROCESSED
Explanation: The specified DB2 catalog or directory object is not available either because the object is no longer
used by DB2 or because it will not exist until DB2 prepares to enter new-function mode.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
object-type
The type of object.
object-qualifier.object-name
The name of the object, as a qualified name.
This message is expected for: DB2 catalog and directory objects that will be created at the beginning of
enabling-new-function mode and for obsolete DB2 catalog and directory objects that have been converted into new
objects by installation job DSNTIJEN.
For example, in conversion mode, RECOVER and REBUILD INDEX skip catalog and directory objects that are new
for the version to which you are migrating. In new-function mode, these utilities skip catalog and directory objects
that are obsolete in the version to which you are migrating. Specifying OPTIONS EVENT(ITEMERROR,SKIP) or
OPTIONS EVENT(ITEMERROR,HALT) does not affect the skipping of new or obsolete objects.
System action: Processing continues.
The utility continues to process other specified objects, if any exist, but the COPY, RECOVER, and REBUILD INDEX
utilities skip the processing of the object that is named in this message.
For image copies that are allocated in JCL using DD statements, the COPY utility will open and close the output
image copy data set if the data set resides on tape. This action happens even if this message is issued, in order to
facilitate successful tape stacking of subsequent image copy data sets.
System programmer response: No action is required if DB2 is in either conversion mode or enabling-new-function
mode.
If DB2 is in new-function mode, edit the COPY, RECOVER, and REBUILD INDEX jobs to remove the obsolete DB2
catalog and directory objects.

DSNU1544I csect-name RECOVER BACKOUT YES CANNOT PROCEED ON object-type object-qualifier.object-name DUE TO SQL MASS DELETE OR OTHER TABLE ACTIVITY
Explanation: The BACKOUT YES option was specified for the RECOVER utility, but the utility cannot proceed
because of one the following operations on the object:
v SQL mass DELETE
v TRUNCATE TABLE
v DROP TABLE
The deleted data for these operations is not logged and therefore cannot be backed out. A BACKOUT YES recovery is
prohibited when one of these operations has occurred between the recovery point (specified by TOLOGPOINT or
TORBA) and the current time.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
object-type
The type of object.
object-qualifier.object-name
The name of the object, as a qualified name.
System action: The RECOVER job fails.
User response: Remove the BACKOUT YES option from the RECOVER utility statement and resubmit the job. This
revised statement indicates that the utility is to recover the list of objects by restoring a backup and then applying the
logs forward to the recovery point.

DSNU1545I csect-name RECOVER WITH BACKOUT YES CANNOT PROCEED. THE RECOVERY POINT IS OLDER THAN THE EARLIEST CHECKPOINT IN THE BSDS.
Explanation: The recovery point that is identified by TOLOGPOINT or TORBA is not contained within the most
recent DB2 system checkpoints that are recorded in the BSDS for each member. RECOVER with the BACKOUT YES
option cannot proceed, because the checkpoint RBA that is before the recovery point for each member is required for
backout processing.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
System action: The RECOVER utility ends with return code 8 and does not process any of the objects. The objects
are left in the state that they were in before the RECOVER operation.
System programmer response: Remove the BACKOUT YES option and resubmit the RECOVER job. This revised job
recovers the objects to the same point in time. However, the data is recovered by using a recovery base and applying
the logs rather than using backout processing.
Recommendation: Use the output from the REPORT utility with the RECOVERY option for all of the objects to
ensure that a valid recovery base exists before you run RECOVER.

Explanation: The LOGCSR phase of the utility is complete or was skipped because no active units of recovery (URs)
existed at the recovery point. The counts of units of recovery in the message indicate the number of units of work
that have execution states that require rollback action to be performed during this recovery process in order to ensure
recovery consistency.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
utility-name
The name of the utility: RECOVER or FLASHCOPY WITH CONSISTENCY.
inflight-count
The number of inflight units of recovery. These units of recovery neither completed phase one of the commit
process nor began the process of backing out during the recovery point. The utility will roll back the
changes during the LOGUNDO phase.
inabort-count
The number of in-abort units of recovery. These units of recovery were in the process of being backed out
during recovery point. The utility will roll back the changes during the LOGUNDO phase.
indoubt-count
The number of indoubt units of recovery. These units of recovery were interrupted between phase one and
phase two of the commit process. They are treated as in-abort units of recovery, and the utility will roll back
the changes during the LOGUNDO phase.
postponed-count
The number of postponed in-abort units of recovery. The backout of these units of recovery was postponed
in an earlier restart process, and they were not attended to prior to the recovery point. The utility will roll
back the changes during the LOGUNDO phase.
committed-count
The number of committed units of recovery. These units of recovery will be backed out during RECOVER
backout log apply processing.
aborted-count
The number of units of recovery that have completed abort processing. These units of recovery will be
backed out during RECOVER backout log apply processing.
If an active unit of recovery exists during the recovery point, the message text is followed by a table that shows the
status of units of recovery that were active during the recovery to point-in-time on the objects being recovered. This
table helps to identify the following conditions:
v Units of recovery that have changes on the recovered objects which need to be rolled back during the LOGUNDO
phase.
v The scope of log records that require processing in order to roll back the changes.
For each active unit of recovery in the table, the table contains one line that shows information about the unit of
recovery:
MEM T CONID CORRID AUTHORIZATION ID PLAN S
URID DAY TIME
MEM The name of theDB2 member to which this unit of recovery belongs. In a data sharing environment, this
field identifies theDB2 member. In a non-data sharing environment, this field is blank.
T The connection type:
B Batch: A batch program or QMF user.
I Internal: A system service being performed on a user's behalf.
S Subsystem: Work that originated from an attached subsystem, either CICS or IMS/VS.
CONID
The connection identifier for related units of recovery. Batch connections are not related to any other
connection. Subsystem connections with the same identifier indicate units of recovery that originated from
the same subsystem.
CORRID
The correlation identifier, which is unique within a subsystem connection. It relates a unit of recovery to a
particular CICS or IMS/VS transaction.
AUTHORIZATION ID
Authorization identifier of the user for whom this unit of recovery was created.
PLAN Name of the plan that is allocated to the unit of recovery.
S Status of the unit of recovery during the recovery point:
D Indoubt: The unit of recovery had completed the first phase of commit, but DB2 had not received
the second phase instruction. Its change on the objects being recovered must be rolled back.
E Committed: The unit of recovery has been committed.
F Inflight: The unit of recovery had not completed the first phase of commit. Its change on the objects
being recovered must be rolled back.
P Postponed abort: The unit of recovery has not yet completed backout afterDB2 was last restarted.
Its change on the objects being recovered must be rolled back.
URID The unit of recovery identifier, which is the log RBA of the beginning of this unit of work.
DAY The day that the unit of recovery was created, in the format ddd. It is approximately the time of the first
SQL statement of the application or the first SQL statement following a commit point.
TIME The time the unit of recovery was created, in the format hh:mm:ss. It is approximately the time of the first
SQL statement of the application or the first SQL statement following a commit point.
This line is followed by one or more lines that show information about the objects that are included in the job and
are modified by this unit of recovery. If the object is partitioned, one line represents each partition that is included in
the job and is modified by this unit of recovery:

Explanation: The backup of the indicated object, data or logs, has completed successfully.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
object-name
The identifier of the object that was backed up.
copy-pool-name
The name of the copy pool.
token-value
The TOKEN value that was specified in the utility control statement.
lrsn-value
The RBA or LRSN of the last log record written to the active log data sets after the backup of the database
copy pool was complete. Note that the same data complete LRSN value is reported in the DSNU1614I
messages for the data and logs. When you copy both the database and log copy pools use this data
complete LRSN as the log truncation point for the conditional restart of DB2 for system recovery to a point
in time if the log copy pool is restored, or for cloned systems created with a system-level backup.
elapsed-time
The elapsed time of the utility in hours, minutes, and seconds, shown in the following format: hh:mm:ss
System action: Processing continues.
System programmer response: When this message is issued for the database copy pool, capture the data complete
LRSN. You can use the LRSN to determine the following information:
v Which system-level backup is used by RESTORE SYSTEM during system point in time recovery. The RESTORE
SYSTEM utility chooses a system-level backup (for the restore of the database copy pool) when the data complete
LRSN is less than the SYSPITR log point.
v The CRESTART ENDRBA, ENDLRSN, or SYSPITR log truncation point for conditional restart of DB2 when the log
copy pool has been restored outside of DB2
v The CRESTART ENDRBA or ENDLRSN for the conditional restart of DB2 for cloned systems
You can use the Print Log Map Utility, DSNJU004, to print information for system-level backups, including the data
complete LRSN. For a data sharing systems, invoke DSNJU004 on the BSDS for the member where the backup was
invoked.
For a conditional restart of DB2, use the Change Log Inventory Utility, DSNJU003, to create the conditional restart
record (CRESTART).

DSNU1615I DUMPONLY WAS SPECIFIED, BUT NO SYSTEM-LEVEL BACKUP CORRESPONDING TO THE TOKEN EXISTS
Explanation: The request to dump a specific system-level backup to tape has failed because either:
v A system-level backup with the specified token does not exist, or
v The DASD version of the system-level backup is invalid
System action: BACKUP SYSTEM processing terminates without dumping the system-level backup to tape.
System programmer response: Issue the DFSMShsm LIST COPYPOOL command with the ALLVOLS option for the
DB2 database copy pool. Run the Print Log Map Utility (DSNJU004) to print the system-level backup information. If
data sharing, ensure that the system-level backup information from all members is gathered. Locate the system-level
backup information in the DSNJU004 output and compare it with the output from the LIST COPYPOOL command.

Explanation: The call to DFSMShsm to RESTORE SYSTEM with the indicated copy pool name and token failed
during DFSMShsm processing. DFSMSHSM will have issued message ARC1806E indicating the cause of the error.
This message can be found in the job log of the RESTORE SYSTEM utility.
If this is the first attempt by the RESTORE SYSTEM utility to do the RESTORE, a second attempt will be made if
there is another appropriate Backup version recorded in the BACKUP SYSTEM history BSDS record. An appropriate
Backup version is one for which data backup completed before the log truncation point indicated in the SYSPITR
parameter of the conditional restart command, CRESTART CREATE. Messages indicating the progress of a
subsequent attempt will be issued, just as for the first attempt.
If the second attempt fails, no further attempts will be made and the request will be failed.
System action: If this is the first attempt to do the RESTORE and there is another appropriate Backup available, a
second attempt will be made. Otherwise the utility will terminate.
System programmer response: Correct the problem identified in message ARC1806E and rerun the utility.
Problem determination: The job log will contain the ARC1806E message that is issued by DFSMShsm. This message
will contain information indicating the cause of the failure in DFSMShsm.

DSNU1619I csect-name - RESTORE SYSTEM UTILITY FAILED, BECAUSE THERE ARE NO BACKUP SYSTEM HISTORY ENTRIES IN THE BSDS WITH A DATA COMPLETION LRSN/RBA PRIOR TO THE LOG TRUNCATION POINT
Explanation: The RESTORE SYSTEM utility failed, because the logs have been truncated to a point before which
any backups are available.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
BACKUP SYSTEM history entries exist in the BSDS. However, none of them indicate a data backup completion LRSN
or RBA with a value less than the log truncation point. The log truncation point is indicated in the SYSPITR
parameter of the conditional restart command, CRESTART CREATE, that is used to truncate the logs.
If you ran RESTORE SYSTEM with the FROMDUMP option, references in this message to BACKUP SYSTEM history
entries refer only to history entries for backups that were dumped to tape.

DSNU1624I csect-name - system-utility SYSTEM UTILITY FAILED BECAUSE ONE OR MORE NON-DORMANT MEMBERS ARE IN A FAILED OR NOT NORMALLY QUIESCED STATE. THOSE MEMBERS ARE: member-id
Explanation: The BACKUP or RESTORE of the members of a data sharing group requires that all members be active
or normally quiesced. If any members are found not to be in either of these states, the BACKUP or RESTORE cannot
continue.
System action: The utility is terminated.
System programmer response: Determine why these systems are in a problem state, and whether they can be
moved out of this state. Once all members have been returned to either the active or normally quiesced state,
resubmit the job.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSNU1626I csect-name - system-utility SYSTEM UTILITY FAILED BECAUSE RESTORE SYSTEM IS ALREADY RUNNING OR ANOTHER TASK IS PROCESSING IN A MANNER THAT PREVENTS THIS TASK FROM SERIALIZING PROPERLY
Explanation: The attempt to acquire the serialization lock failed. In the case of RESTORE SYSTEM, this can only
occur if RESTORE SYSTEM is already running. In the case of BACKUP SYSTEM, this can occur if any of the
following events are in process:
v System checkpoint
v Data set extensions
v Writing 32K pages
v Writing close page set control log records (PSCRs)
v Creating data sets (for table spaces, indexes, and so on)
v Deleting data sets (for dropping tables spaces, indexes, and so on)
v Renaming data sets (for online reorganizing of table spaces, indexes, and so forth during the switch phase)
System action: The utility is terminated.
System programmer response: If it is the RESTORE SYSTEM utility that is being invoked, the only other utility that
can be running is RESTORE SYSTEM. If it is the BACKUP SYSTEM utility that is being invoked, any system activity
that provokes any of the processes listed in the Explanation above could be the cause of the failure. If possible,
determine which utility is responsible and resubmit this job once that utility completes. You may also resubmit your
job at a later, less busy time.

DSNU1630I csect-name BACKUP SYSTEM UTILITY FAILED, BECAUSE action FCINCREMENTAL WAS SPECIFIED BUT THE INCREMENTAL FLASHCOPY COULD NOT BE PROCESSED
Explanation: This message is issued when all of the following conditions exist:
v The database copy pool has been defined with more than one DASD version.
v A persistent incremental FlashCopy relationship already exists for the database copy pool.
v The next version or backup of the database copy pool to be taken is for a full FlashCopy rather than an
incremental FlashCopy.
If the action specified is ESTABLISH, then a persistent incremental FlashCopy relationship already exists for the
database copy pool.
If the action specified is END, then the persistent incremental FlashCopy relationship cannot be ended because the
next version of the database copy pool to be taken is for a full FlashCopy, rather than for the incremental FlashCopy.
System programmer response: Remove the ESTABLISH FCINCREMENTAL option or the END FCINCREMENTAL
option and rerun the BACKUP SYSTEM utility job. This will create a full FlashCopy of the database copy pool. It will
also create the log copy pool if the FULL option was specified.
If you specified ESTABLISH FCINCREMENTAL and it is important based on your schedule of backing up your
system for this invocation of the BACKUP SYSTEM utility to create a system-level backup that's copy of the database
copy pool is an incremental FlashCopy, then analyze the following:
v The job output from the last couple of invocations of the BACKUP SYSTEM utility. Look for message DSNU1639I.
v The output from the DFSMShsm LIST COPYPOOL command for the database copy pool.
v The output from the print log map utility (DSNJU004) for the system-level backup information. Look for
system-level backups with TYPE=I.
If you specified END FCINCREMENTAL, then remove these keywords until the next backup version of the database
copy pool to be taken is the version associated with the persistent incremental FlashCopy relationship. END
FCINCREMENTAL can only be specified to take a last incremental FlashCopy and withdraw the persistent
incremental FlashCopy relationship when the backup version to be taken is the incremental FlashCopy relationship.

DISPLAY SYSTEM THREAD REPORT COMPLETE
Each thread that meets the report criteria is listed on a separate line. Additional information might be provided for
individual threads.
DB2 db2-statestate-phase
The state of DB2 as follows:
db2-state
The state of DB2. Possible values are STARTING, STOPPING, or ACTIVE.
state-phase
The phase of restart or shutdown, if available. If db2-state is ACTIVE, no phase information is
provided.
NAME text
The connection name that was used to establish the thread.
If the connection status value is D, the connection name is either the connection name for the allied
address space or the DB2 subsystem name.
For distributed database access threads, this field contains the following information:
requester-value
For threads that access the server from a DB2 for z/OS requester, this value is the connection name
of the thread at the requesting location.
SERVER
For threads that access the server from a non-DB2 for z/OS requester, no connection name is
identified.
blank For threads where the originating task is running on the same DB2 subsystem, this value is blank.
When the connection name value is blank, the expected connection status value is PT.
ST t A one- or two-letter code that indicates connection status. Possible values are:
AC A thread is executing in an accelerator server. This status is displayed until accelerator processing
concludes and returns control to DB2.
D The thread is in the process of termination as a result of the termination of the associated allied
task. If this thread is also the last (or only) DB2 thread for the address space, the associated allied
task is placed in a wait state.
For an active thread, this value can indicate possible problems with DB2. If the activity indicator
value is *, use the information in message DSN3201I to identify and resolve any problems.
DA The database access thread slot is currently not associated with a remote connection and is available
to be assigned to a type 2 inactive thread.
DI The thread is disconnected from an execution unit. No TCB is associated with the DB2 thread.
This value is possible is only when the connection name is RRSAF.
N The thread is in either IDENTIFY or SIGNON status.
This value is accompanied by a token value of 0.
ND The thread is in either IDENTIFY or SIGNON status, and the thread is currently not associated with
any TCB.
PT A parallel task thread was established (plan allocated).
QD The thread is queued for termination as a result of the termination of the associated allied task. If
this thread is also the last (or only) DB2 thread for the address space, the associated allied task is
placed in a wait state.
For an active thread, this value can indicate possible problems with DB2. If the activity indicator
value is *, use the information in message DSN3201I to identify and resolve any problems.
QT The CREATE THREAD request was queued. The associated allied task is placed in a wait state.
R2 A distributed thread is accessing a remote site on behalf of a request from another location. The
thread is currently an inactive connection (type 2 inactive thread) and is waiting for an agent to
become available.
RA A distributed thread is accessing a remote site on behalf of a request from another location.
RK A distributed thread is accessing a remote site on behalf of a request from another location. The
thread is performing an operation that invoked Kerberos services. This status is displayed until
Kerberos services returns control to DB2.
RN A distributed thread is accessing a remote site on behalf of a request from another location. The
request accesses data at another DB2 location. Therefore, the thread was suspended until DB2
connects to the partner location (establishes DB2 system conversations with the partner).
When another DB2 site is being contacted for the first time using system-directed access, DB2 must
establish DB2 system conversations with the partner location. A request is presented to a DB2 DDF
service task that establishes a system conversation. The thread is suspended until the request is
processed. If the thread remains in this status for an extended period of time, the DB2 service task
that establishes the system conversations might be busy processing other requests. The DB2
DISPLAY LOCATION command (DISPLAY LOCATION(*) DETAIL) shows conversation activity for
this DB2 system conversation (SYSCON-O) service task.
RQ A distributed thread is accessing a remote site on behalf of a request from another location.
The thread is suspended for one of the following reasons:
v The maximum number of active database access threads was reached. The number of threads is
described by the MAX REMOTE ACTIVE value of the DSN6SYSP macro in the DB2 startup
parameter, usually DSNZPARM.
v The system profile monitoring threshold was reached. The threshold is described in the
DSN_PROFILE_ATTRIBUTES table.
Database access agents (DBAAs) are queued until other DBAAs deallocate or go inactive, providing
an available slot. The DBAA resumes when a slot becomes available, and the DBAA is next in the
queue.
Consider increasing the MAX REMOTE ACTIVE value.
RX The distributed thread is executing an XA transaction on behalf of a request from another location.
SP A thread is running within a stored procedure. This status value is displayed until the stored
procedure terminates and returns control to DB2.
SW A thread is waiting for a stored procedure to be scheduled. This status value is displayed until the
stored procedure begins to run.
T An allied, nondistributed thread was established (plan allocated).
TD An allied thread was established (plan allocated), and the thread is currently not associated with
any TCB.
TN An allied thread was distributed to access data at another DB2 location, but it was suspended
because DB2 was not connected to the partner location.
When another DB2 site is being contacted for the first time using system-directed access, DB2 must
establish DB2 system conversations with the partner location. A request is presented to a DB2 DDF
service task that establishes a system conversation. The thread is suspended until the request is
processed. If the thread remains in this status for an extended period of time, the DB2 service task
that establishes the system conversations might be busy processing other requests. The DB2
DISPLAY LOCATION command (DISPLAY LOCATION(*) DETAIL) shows conversation activity for
this DB2 system conversation (SYSCON-O) service task.
TR An allied thread was distributed to access data at another location.
A t An indicator that the thread is active within DB2. t can have one of the following values:
* The thread is active.
blank The thread is inactive.
REQ num
A counter that shows the number of DB2 requests. This counter restarts at 1 when the count exceeds 32767
requests.
ID text The recovery correlation ID that is associated with the thread.
||| |
For distributed database access threads, this field contains one of the following values:
028.DBAA nn
This value indicates that the database access agent (DBAA) is performing connection processing,
which consists of establishing the DBAA thread and validating and verifying the user's ID.
RACF requests are serialized on one of the DB2 RACF service tasks. This serialization might
increase the validation time when multiple DBAAs are being created concurrently.
This value is possible only while the thread is being created.
requester-value
For threads that use system-directed access or application-directed access from a DB2 requester, this
value is the correlation ID of the thread at the requesting location.
This value is possible only after the thread has been created.
external-name
For threads that use application-directed access from a non-DB2 requester, this value is the first 12
characters in the DDM external name (EXTNAM) parameter of the DDM EXCSAT command that is
received as part of the SQL CONNECT statement.
This value is possible only after the thread has been created.
AUTHID text
The authorization ID that is associated with a signed-on connection.
PLAN text
The plan name that is associated with the thread.
For distributed database access threads, this field contains one of the following values:
DISTSERV
For threads that use application-directed access from a non-DB2 requester, no plan name is
identified.
requester-value
For threads that use system-directed access or application-directed access from a DB2 requester, this
value is the plan name that is being executed at the requesting location.
For RRSAF connected threads that did not specify a plan name at connect time, the value ?RRSAF is
displayed.
If a thread was not established, this field is blank.
If this value is a system plan, see the information about system plans in message DSNT376I.
ASID hex
The address space ID (ASID) of the home address space. This value is a hexadecimal number of up to four
characters.
TOKEN num
The thread token that is assigned to the thread.
For threads with a connection status value of N, this value is 0.
The information about types of threads ends with a REPORT COMPLETE line.
Information about indoubt and postponed threads (DSNV406I and DSNV431I):
The DISPLAY THREAD command reports the same type of information about indoubt and postponed threads.

individual threads.
COORDINATOR text
The name of the two-phase commit coordinator. The value depends on the type of thread, as follows:
Allied threads
The coordinator name is one of the following values:
v The IMS connection name
v The CICS connection name
v RRS (for Resource Recovery Services attachment facility connected threads)
v The location name of the local DB2 subsystem.
Additional information is displayed for IMS and CICS connections and for RRS.
Database access threads
The coordinator name is one of the following values:
v location:luname, where location is the relational database name for the coordinator and luname is
the SNA LU name for the coordinator.
v location:port, where location is the relational database name for the coordinator and port is the
TCP/IP port number for two-phase commit resynchronization for the coordinator.
v <luname>:luname, where luname is the SNA LU name for the coordinator.
v nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn:port , where nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn is the IP address for the coordinator and port is the
TCP/IP port number for two-phase commit resynchronization for the coordinator.
If the thread is distributed, additional information is displayed.
STATUS text
The status of the thread.
If the status of a thread for a logical unit of work at a participant is INDOUBT, COMMITTED-H, or
ABORTED-H, and the coordinator is a DB2 location that has not cold started, the lack of any information
about the thread in a DISPLAY THREAD(INDOUBT) report indicates that the decision at the coordinator
was to abort the logical unit of work.
This field can have one of the following values:
ABORT-P
A postponed abort unit of recovery. Objects for which this unit of recovery has backout work
pending are inaccessible (restart-pending status) until the abort is completed (for example, by
means of the RECOVER POSTPONED command).
ABORT-PSTRT
A postponed abort unit of recovery that is currently undergoing RECOVER POSTPONED
processing or automatic DB2 backout processing (requested by restarting with system parameter
LBACKOUT = AUTO).
ABORTED
A coordinator status that indicates that DB2 has one or more downstream participants that are
using the Presumed Nothing (PN) protocol and might be indoubt. The thread is included in the
DISPLAY THREAD output until all downstream PN participants complete indoubt resolution. The
detail line V450 lists the downstream participants that have pending resolution. Database locks that
were held for the thread are released.
If a participant resolved the indoubt thread with a heuristic decision, and the decision was
COMMIT, detail line V452 is displayed. This detail line contains the name of the participant and the
heuristic decision that it made. Because the coordinator aborted and the participant committed, this
situation indicates heuristic damage. Information about the thread is displayed until it is deleted
with the RESET INDOUBT command. The database administrators at all involved locations need to
know that heuristic damage occurred and at which location.
ABORTED-H
An indoubt thread that was heuristically resolved with the RECOVER INDOUBT command.
Information about the thread is displayed is displayed until the coordinator is informed of the
heuristic decision. Additional detail lines might be included in the report.
COMMITTED
A thread that is committed. This status is displayed when DB2 is the coordinator and has
downstream participants that might be indoubt. Information about the thread is included in the
DISPLAY THREAD output until all downstream participants complete indoubt resolution. Detail
line V450 lists the downstream participants that have pending resolution. Database locks that were
held for the thread are released.
If a participant resolved the indoubt thread with a heuristic decision, and the decision was ABORT
(rollback), detail line V453 is displayed. This detail line contains the name of the participant and the
heuristic decision that it made. Because the coordinator committed and the participant aborted, this
situation indicates heuristic damage. Information about the thread is displayed until it is deleted
with the RESET INDOUBT command. The database administrators at all involved locations need to
know that heuristic damage occurred and at which location.
COMMITTED-H
An indoubt thread that was heuristically resolved with the RECOVER INDOUBT command.
Information about the thread is displayed until the coordinator is informed of the heuristic decision,
and all downstream participants, if any, complete indoubt resolution. Additional detail lines might
be included in the report to identify downstream participants that have pending resolution.
INDOUBT
A thread that is indoubt. Information about the thread is displayed until all indoubt resolution
responsibilities are complete. Additional detail lines might be included in the report.
RESET txt
If this column contains YES, the thread must be removed from the indoubt display. If necessary, use the
RESET INDOUBT command to purge a thread. If this column is empty, the thread does not need to be
removed.
URID hex
An RBA of the DB2 recovery log. This point is the beginning of recovery logging for this thread.

The DISPLAY THREAD command must include the TYPE(ACTIVE) and DETAIL options, or the TYPE (INDOUBT)
option for this information to be included.
Line V440 indicates that the thread is managed by an XA transaction manager, such as WebSphere? Application
Server, which identifies the transaction with an xid value. The XID is provided to allow correlation with the XA
transaction manager. DB2 uses both the logical unit of work identifier, luwid, and the XA transaction identifier, xid, to
coordinate and recover transactions. DB2 is a participant in an XA transaction that is executing on behalf of an XA
transaction manager.

Explanation: This message is issued in response to the CANCEL THREAD command. The thread is scheduled for
termination.
System action: The specified thread is scheduled for termination. The termination of the thread does not occur
unless processing is occurring within DB2.
DSNV427I csect-name INVALID THREAD token SPECIFIED
Explanation: This message is issued in response to the CANCEL THREAD command. No thread with the specified
token was found.
System action: The specified thread is not canceled.
User response: Determine the correct token of the thread you want to cancel and reissue the command. You can use
the -DISPLAY THREAD command to display all thread activity.
DSNV428I csect-name THREAD token WAS PREVIOUSLY CANCELED
Explanation: The thread with the specified token was previously canceled by either the CANCEL THREAD or
CANCEL DDF THREAD command, or is already in the process of termination.
The CANCEL command terminates the thread only if the thread is processing in DB2 or is currently suspended by
DB2. The thread might not be processing in DB2 in these situations:
v The thread is processing in the application and has not made a request to DB2. The DISPLAY THREAD command
indicates this.
v The user placed the thread on an MVS resource using the ENQUE command. The CANCEL command has no
effect on the thread until ENQUE completes and the thread returns to DB2.
v The thread is processing in VTAM and is waiting for a response from a partner. The DISPLAY THREAD DETAIL
command indicates this. The thread does not terminate until VTAM returns to DB2. VTAM commands, which will
terminate the session or LU, can be used to cause VTAM to return to DB2.

DSNW001I ASYNCHRONOUSLY GATHERED DATA IS BEING FORMATTED IN THIS DUMP
Explanation: The subsystem formatting exit is not using DB2 summary dump records for formatting. The formatted
control blocks may not contain the same values as they did at the time of the error.
System action: Dump formatting continues.
System programmer response: If you want DB2 summary dump records to be used, do not specify the
'SUMDUMP=NO' operand on the dump control statement.
DSNW002I SUMMARY DUMP RECORDS ARE BEING FORMATTED IN THIS DUMP
Explanation: The subsystem formatting exit is using DB2 summary dump record information to format its control
blocks.
System action: Dump formatting continues.
System programmer response: If you do not want DB2 summary dump records to be used in formatting, specify
the 'SUMDUMP=NO' and 'SUBSYS=subsystem name' on the dump control statement. Both operands are required.
DSNW004I ONE OR MORE INVALID OPERANDS WERE FOUND ON THE DSNWDMP CONTROL CARD.  SUBSYSTEM FORMATTING TERMINATED
Explanation: An invalid operand was found on the dump control statement. The operand was not 'SG', 'LG', 'SA',
'AA', or 'ALL'.
System action: Control returns to AMDPRDMP or IPCS to terminate the exit.
System programmer response: Correct the dump control statement operand specified by message DSNW007I.
DSNW005I DUMP FORMATTER WORK BUFFER (DSNWDBUF) CANNOT BE LOCATED
Explanation: The subsystem formatting exit could not locate its work buffer.
System action: Control returns to AMDPRDMP or IPCS to terminate the exit.
System programmer response: Increase the region size.
DSNW006I THE ERLY BLOCK CANNOT BE ACCESSED OR IT IS INVALID
Explanation: The subsystem formatting exit could not locate its anchor block.
System action: Control returns to AMDPRDMP or IPCS to terminate the exit.
System programmer response: Specify 'SUBSYS=subsystem name', 'SUMDUMP=NO' on the dump control
statement. The subsystem name should have between 1 and 4 characters.
DSNW007I THE FOLLOWING OPERAND SPECIFIED ON THE DSNWDMP CONTROL CARD IS INVALID: xxxx
Explanation: The specified operand was not one of the valid dump control statement operands.
System action: Control returns to AMDPRDMP or IPCS to terminate the exit.
System programmer response: Check the dump control statement operands.
DSNW008I THE SCOM CANNOT BE ACCESSED OR IT IS INVALID
Explanation: An error was encountered while trying to retrieve the SCOM.
System action: Control returns to AMDPRDMP or IPCS to terminate the exit.
System programmer response: If 'SUMDUMP=NO' was specified on the dump control statement, omit this
operand, and resubmit the job. Otherwise, specify this operand on the dump control statement, and resubmit the job.
DSNW009I THE ADDRESS SPACE REQUESTED IS NOT AVAILABLE
Explanation: The DB2 control blocks for the address space specified on the 'SA=asid' dump operand could not be
located.
System action: Formatting continues if other dump operands were specified.
System programmer response: Check the ASID specified on the 'SA=' dump operand. The ASID must be specified
in hexadecimal.
DSNW010I THE TRACE RMFT CANNOT BE ACCESSED OR IT IS INVALID
Explanation: The DB2 trace table could not be located.
System action: Formatting of the DB2 trace table is bypassed, and formatting continues of any other requested
dump segment.
System programmer response: If 'SUMDUMP=NO' was specified on the dump control statement, omit this
operand. Otherwise, specify this operand on the dump control statement. In either case, resubmit the job.
DSNW011I A LARGER REGION SIZE IS REQUIRED FOR THIS JOB
Explanation: The subsystem formatting exit could not obtain a large enough work buffer to process the summary
dump records.
System action: Subsystem formatting continues.
System programmer response: Rerun the job, specifying a larger region size in the JCL.
DSNW013I DMPW NOT FOUND IN SUMMARY DUMP
Explanation: The subsystem formatting exit was unable to locate the DMPW control block in the summary record
portion of the dump data set. Because the DMPW provides the main anchor block for the dump formatter, processing
is terminated.
System action: Control returns to AMDPRDMP or IPCS to terminate the exit.
System programmer response: If this is not a DB2 dump data set, specify 'SUBSYS=xxxx,SUMDUMP=NO' on the
dump control statement (where xxxx is the 1- to 4-character subsystem name), so that the subsystem formatting exit
does not attempt to use summary dump data.
DSNW014I REQUIRED SUMMARY DUMP RECORDS ARE NOT IN THIS DUMP. WILL ATTEMPT TO FORMAT FROM NON- SUMMARY DUMP
Explanation: Expected data could not be found in the summary dump. This message is issued for information only.
Dump formatting continues. However, it will take longer, because a greater volume of data COMMAND PQUIT
must be analyzed.
System action: Formatting is attempted using the full dump instead of the summary dump.
System programmer response: Though processing continues, this message is an indication of a problem, and should
be pursued as such.
DSNW015I SSCVT NOT LOCATED. CHECK THE SUBSYSTEM NAME ON THE CONTROL CARD
Explanation: In a search through the SSCVT chain, a match of the subsystem name in the SSCVTs and the
subsystem name on the control statement was not found.
System action: Formatting for the named subsystem is not done.
Operator response: Check the 'SUBSYS=' operand on the control statement.
System programmer response: Correctly specify the subsystem name on the control statement.
DSNW016I THE RMVT CANNOT BE ACCESSED OR IT IS INVALID
Explanation: The subsystem formatting exit could not locate the RMVT. The RMVT is required for formatting the
DB2 trace table and a number of other DB2 control blocks.
System action: Formatting of the DB2 trace table is bypassed, and formatting of other requested dump segments
continues.
System programmer response: If 'SUMDUMP=NO' was specified on the dump control statement, omit this
operand. Otherwise, try specifying this operand on the dump control statement. In either case, resubmit the job.
DSNW017I MAXIMUM STACK LEVEL EXCEEDED
Explanation: This condition is usually caused by the DB2 control block formatter looping. The stack array is
depleted and can no longer accommodate control blocks.
System action: Dump formatting is terminated.
System programmer response: Examine the control block chains to see if they are looping. If those chains are not
looping, increase the dimension of the stack array.
DSNW018I SUBSYS= NOT SPECIFIED ON THE CONTROL CARD OR MISSING. REQUIRED IF SUMDUMP=NO SPECIFIED
Explanation: One of the following errors occurred:
v The 'SUMDUMP=NO' option was specified, but either the 'SUBSYS=' operand is missing, or it was incorrectly
specified.
v A trace class was specified that would have resulted in an orphaned OP buffer. The trace class specified will not
start, but the remainder of the classes are started.
System action: Dump formatting is terminated.
Operator response: Run the dump printing job after the error has been corrected.
DSNW020I UNSUCCESSFUL SEARCH FOR THE ERLY CONTROL BLOCK
Explanation: The 'ERLY' control block could not be located in the dump.
System action: Dump formatting is terminated.
Operator response: Check that the 'SUBSYS=' operand was correctly specified, and rerun the job.
System programmer response: This message can mean that the 'ERLY' control block has been overlaid. Examine the
full dump to determine whether the subsystem is present. If it is, you may be able to determine why the control
block could not be located.
DSNW022I THE RESIDENT TRACE WAS NOT ACTIVE AT THE TIME OF DUMP
Explanation: Trace table formatting has been attempted, but no trace table existed at the time of the dump.
System action: Dump formatting continues with any other control blocks that were to be formatted.
DSNW023I THE TRACE TABLE ENTRY IS OUT OF SEQUENCE OR OVERLAID
Explanation: A trace entry is overlaid by another trace entry of a different timestamp. This message is issued to flag
an unrecognized trace entry. This can occur when the oldest entry in the table is the second half of a double entry.
System action: Formatting of the trace table continues.
DSNW024I TRACE TABLE
Explanation: The trace table follows.
System action: Trace table formatting follows.
DSNW025I DUMP ACCESS ERROR ACCESSING THE TRACE TABLE IN THE DUMP
Explanation: A nonzero return code was returned from the storage access routine when accessing the trace table.
System action: Trace table formatting is bypassed.
System programmer response: Check the address and ASID of the trace table.

DSNW030I DUMP ACCESS ERROR ACCESSING THE CONTROL BLOCK STRUCTURE TABLE IN THE DUMP
Explanation: The control block structure table cannot be accessed from the dump.
System action: Control block formatting is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
DSNW032I DUMP ACCESS ERROR ACCESSING ANCHOR CONTROL BLOCK
Explanation: The anchor control block cannot be accessed from the dump.
System action: Control block formatting is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
DSNW033I BEGINNING FORMATTING
Explanation: Formatting of DB2 control blocks is beginning.
DSNW034I TRACE TABLE AND GLOBAL BLOCKS ALREADY DUMPED
Explanation: An indicative dump is being requested. The DB2 trace table and the global blocks have already been
dumped with first dump (full dump) for this abend dump (SNAP) invocation. These are, therefore, not dumped in
the dump for this task.
DSNW035I WARNING - NO TASK RELATED CONTROL BLOCKS FOR THIS TASK
Explanation: The TCB for which the dump is being requested is not IDENTIFIED to DB2. Task-related control
blocks are not dumped. The DB2 trace table and global blocks are dumped only if the 'SYSABEND' DD statement is
present and only if this is the first of the dump(s) (full dump) for this abend dump (SNAP) invocation.
System action: No DB2 formatting is done for the specified task.
DSNW036I CONTROL BLOCKS FOR TASKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ABOVE RECOVERY COORDINATOR TASK
Explanation: The formatted blocks following this message are associated with TCBs that have IDENTIFIED to DB2
with the 'recovery coordinator = no' option. These TCBs may not have invoked SNAP, but they are associated with
the TCB that did.
System action: Related control blocks are dumped.
System programmer response: Examine the control blocks for relevant information.
DSNW037I TASK RELATED CONTROL BLOCKS FOR THIS TASK
Explanation: The formatted blocks following this message are associated with the TCB that is being dumped.
System action: Relevant control blocks are dumped.
System programmer response: Examine the control blocks for relevant information.
DSNW038I END OF FORMATTING
Explanation: Formatting of DB2 control blocks is completed.
DSNW039I SUBSYSTEM FORMATTING COMPLETE FOR THIS DUMP
Explanation: The subsystem formatting routine has completed its processing for this dump data set.
 DSNW040I 'VVV'CONTROL BLOCK FORMATTER ERROR FLAGS
v X'80': FIELD EXPECTED TO BE ZERO IS NONZERO
v X'40': LAST BLOCK IN CHAIN DOES NOT POINT BACK TO PARENT BLOCK
v X'20': BLOCK NOT FOUND IN DUMP
v X'10': BLOCK LENGTH INCORRECT
v X'08': VERIFICATION CODE INCORRECT
v X'04': BLOCK CHAINED FROM THIS BLOCK NOT FOUND IN DUMP
v X'02': BLOCK CHAINED FROM THIS BLOCK HAS WRONG VERIFICATION CODE
v X'01': VALIDATION CONSTANT DOES NOT MATCH EXPECTED VALUE
Explanation: The message DSNW040I appears at the beginning of a formatted dump. It defines the hexadecimal
values associated with the 'VVV=XX' keyword. This keyword is provided on the title line of each control block
selected for formatting. It indicates any unusual conditions encountered during the validation and format processing
of the current control block structure.
System action: Dump formatting continues.
System programmer response: All nonzero 'XX' values should be examined. If an error is indicated, the printout of
the dump should be used for the problem documentation.
Problem determination: Possible errors include:
v X'80'
v X'40'
v X'20'
v X'04'
The current state of the individual control block structures at the time of error might vary with the type of error
involved. Examine control block structures with one of these 'XX' values based on the specific ABEND code.
Example: A X'04' associated with the referencing control block and the X'20' associated with the referenced control
block may mean the ABEND occurred between the release of the referenced control block and re-initialization of the
address within the referencing one.
DB2 validation errors include:
v X'10'
v X'08'
v X'02'
v X'01'
These values indicate that a validation error occurred while formatting the associated control block.
For example, an X'08' associated with the referenced control block indicates the storage area has been overlaid or the
address in the referencing control block is incorrect. Subsequent examination of the values in this control block is not
reliable.
DSNW041I THE TAB CANNOT BE ACCESSED OR IT IS INVALID
Explanation: The DB2 trace table anchor block could not be located.
System action: Formatting of the DB2 trace table is bypassed, and formatting of any other requested dump segment
continues.
System programmer response: If 'SUMDUMP=NO' was specified on the dump control statement, omit this
operand. Otherwise, specify this operand on the dump control statement. In either case, resubmit the job.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
DSNW049I OLDEST SLOT ADDRESS INVALID, FORMATTING TRACE TABLE FROM FIRST ENTRY
Explanation: The next trace table entry location is invalid.
System action: Dump formatting continues.
System programmer response: The printout of the dump should be used for the problem documentation.
Problem determination: The Trace Anchor Block has been initialized incorrectly, or overlaid during execution.
DSNW050I ssid,NO SDWA/LOGREC, ABND=comp-reason,U=user-id, M=module,C=XYR00.vrm.comp-function
Explanation: This message provides the default SVC dump title (SDUMP) associated with the SYS1.DUMP data set
when an SDWA was unavailable during recovery processing. The variable fields are:
ssid 4-character DB2 subsystem name
comp-reason
Abend completion code, followed by the abend reason code.
user-id Authorization-ID for the individual subsystem user.
module Functional recovery routine responsible for the dump.
vrm.comp-function
Component-ID, as follows:
vrm DB2 version, release number, and modification level.
comp-function
Component-ID function.
System action: Dump processing continues.
System programmer response: Since the SDWA provides important diagnostic information to assist in problem
determination, examine the recovery environment at time of error to determine why an SDWA was not provided for
this abend.
In a nonrecovery environment, there may be valid reasons for the lack of an SDWA.
Problem determination: In a recovery environment, functional recovery routines (FRRs) are guaranteed an SDWA
by Recovery Termination Manager (RTM). Therefore, the recovery routine is most likely an ESTAE recovery routine.
The primary reason for an SDWA not being provided to an ESTAE routine is insufficient storage available during
recovery processing. Examine the region sizes allocated to the failing function to ensure that sufficient storage is
available.
In a nonrecovery environment, no SDWA is provided because only RTM can create one.
DSNW051I ERROR DURING DUMP PROCESSING
Explanation: This message is generated by the 'SDUMP dump data gathering service' recovery routine when an
error is encountered during dump processing.
System action: Processing of the 'SUMLSTA' user storage areas is terminated, an SVC dump is requested, and
control is returned to RTM.
System programmer response: This error is documented in a SYS1.LOGREC record. This message can be issued
because of an error in the invocation of SDUMP, or because of an error in SDUMP itself, or during control block
examination and access.
DSNW052I ERROR ENCOUNTERED DURING LOAD OR VALIDATION OF A CONTROL BLOCK STRUCTURE TABLE MODULE
Explanation: The DB2 dump formatting facility cannot be used to format control blocks. An error occurred during
the DB2 startup process while attempting to LOAD one of the Control Block Structures Table (CBDS) modules from
the DB2 subsystem program library.
System action: Subsystem startup processing continues.
Operator response: If intervention is needed, notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If intervention is desired, the DB2 subsystem can be terminated by either an MVS
CANCEL command or a -STOP DB2 command. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the
problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2
Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: The modules must reside in a DB2 program library named on the execution procedure
used to start a DB2 subsystem address space.
The named modules prohibit the use of the DB2 dump formatting facility to format SVC dumps that occur during
the current execution cycle of the DB2 subsystem. The named modules are not required for DB2 execution.
DSNW053I VRA DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION REPORT
Explanation: All DB2 diagnostic information in the Variable Recording Area (VRA) at the time of the error is
extracted and displayed in this report.
The address of the SDWA, the contents of SDWARA, and SDWARA's hexadecimal offset into SDWA are also
displayed. Individual diagnostic entries are identified by a hexadecimal VRA 'key', followed by the length of the
subsequent data. Data fields are displayed in hexadecimal and EBCDIC formats. If you suspect an error in DB2, you
might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data
(Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
System action: Dump format processing continues.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
DSNW054I NO VRA DATA RECORDED IN SDWA
Explanation: The SDWA obtained from the SYS1.DUMP data set contained no diagnostic information in the VRA.
System action: VRA report generation is bypassed, dump format processing continues.
System programmer response: If an error is indicated, the printout of the dump should be used for the problem
documentation. If VRA data is needed, the abending DB2 subcomponent has failed to supply it. If you suspect an
error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem,
see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
DSNW055I FORMAT ROUTINE UNABLE TO LOCATE SDWA
Explanation: The MVS Summary Dump Data Access Service Routine (IEAVTFRD) was unable to locate the SDWA
in the summary data portion of the SYS1.DUMP data set.
System action: VRA report generation is terminated and dump format processing continues.
System programmer response: Take the appropriate action, as indicated in the next section. If an error is indicated,
use the printout of the dump for problem documentation.
Problem determination: The SDWA is placed in the summary data portion of the SYS1.DUMP data set by
AMDPRDMP or IPCS. It indicates either CSA or Local Storage Residency.
If the SDWA is not in the dump data set, no error is indicated.
DSNW056I VRA DIAGNOSTIC REPORT COMPLETE
Explanation: The VRA Diagnostic Report is done.
System action: Dump format processing continues.
DSNW060I BEGIN SAVE AREA TRACE
Explanation: This message identifies the start of the DB2 register Save Area Trace report which appears in the
formatted section of a DB2 SVC Dump. The save areas for the current failing agent execution block (EB), and all
associated Agent EBs, are traced from the point of error and displayed in order of invocation.
The format of this report is as follows:
Save Area Identification
The address and contents of each save area is displayed and identified by the invoking module.
Module-name Service-level-identifier
SA .... WD1 .... HSA .... LSA ....
RET .... EPA .... R0 ....
R1 .... R2 .... R3 ....
R4 .... R5 .... R6 ....
R7 .... R8 .... R9 ....
R10 .... R11 .... R12 ....
Module-name
Identifies the module responsible for obtaining the save area as indicated in the DB2 module entry point list
(MEPL) at the time of the error.
If the MEPL does not contain an entry that corresponds to the module entry point address (EPA), this field
is set to:
MODULE INFORMATION UNAVAILABLE
Service-level-identifier
The service level information associated with the module name is obtained from the corresponding module
MEPL entry, and consists of the compilation-date and the PTF number of the latest maintenance applied.
If no maintenance has been applied for this module, this field defaults to the Function Modification
Identifier (FMID).
SA Identifies the address and contents of each word of the save area and is displayed using the format and
register abbreviation conventions defined by MVS SNAP. All save area data references indicate the primary
address space at the time of execution.
Execution Environment
Displays the current execution environment at the time of error for the save areas that follow. This information is
repeated each time the current Agent execution EB changed during processing.
CURRENT EB=address JOBNAME=name
HASID=hasid PASID=pasid
EXECUTION MODE=mode
address
Address of the associated Agent EB.
name The 8-character MVS jobname associated with the home address space.
hasid Home address space identifier.
pasid Primary address space identifier.
mode Agent EB MVS execution mode:
TCB Task Control Mode
SRB Supervisory Request Mode
Register Save Area Contents for Agent EBs
The contents of the register save area chains for the current failing Agent EB, and all suspended Agent EBs at the
time of error, are displayed using the save area (SA) format.
REGISTERS IN (CB-name) AT TIME OF
execution-status
CB-name
Identifies the name of the control block from which the registers for the current Agent EB were obtained:
SDWA MVS System Diagnostic Workarea (Failure).
TCB MVS Task Control Block (Suspend).
STSV MVS SRB Status Save Area (Suspend).
execution-status
Indicates the current execution status of the Agent EB at the time of error:
Failure Failing execution EB.
Suspend
Suspended execution EB.
Change of Primary Address Space
Since all register data references refer to the primary address space associated with the currently active execution EB,
the following information is displayed each time the primary address changed during execution:
CHANGE OF ADDRESS SPACE, NEW PASID=pasid
pasid Indicates the new primary address space identifier associated with the save areas that follow.
System action: save area trace format processing continues for the failing agent EB, and all associated agent EBs.
System programmer response: See the Problem Determination section.
Problem determination: This report may be used to determine the register contents, module invocation sequence,
and execution environments leading up to the point of error.
DSNW061I SAVE AREA TRACE COMPLETE
Explanation: This message indicates that the DB2 formatted save area trace report (DSNW060I) is complete.
System action: Dump format processing continues.
DSNW062I R6 (R6-contents) DOES NOT CONTAIN A VALID EB ADDRESS
Explanation: During dump format processing of the DB2 formatted Save Area Trace report (DSNW060I), register 6
(R6) did not contain the address of a valid Agent execution block (EB).
R6-contents:
The contents of register 6.
System action: save area trace format processing is terminated for the current Agent EB, and all prior EBs.
System programmer response: The dump formatter expects the contents of register 6 to contain the address of a
valid EB.
Problem determination: Register 6 does not contain the current EB address or a prior EB address.
Refer to the abend reason and completion codes associated with the original error to determine the use of register 6
prior to the failure.
DSNW063I name (address) ASID (asid) NOT FOUND IN DUMP
Explanation: During dump formatter processing of the save area trace report (DSNW060I), a control block or save
area was not found in the dump data set.
Since the dump formatter uses the DB2 and MVS control blocks defined under the 'name' field of this message to
locate individual register save areas, subsequent save areas located via the 'named' control block or save area will not
be displayed in the report.
name Identifies the name of the control block or save area that was not found in the dump data set:
SA Indicates a Save Area
ASCE DB2 Address Space Control Element
EB DB2 Execution Block
TCB MVS Task Control Block
RB MVS Request Block
XSB MVS Extended Status Block
PSA MVS Prefix Save Area
SDWA
MVS System Diagnostic Work Area
STSV MVS SRB Status Save Area
STKE MVS Cross Memory Stack Element
address
The address of the 'named' control block or save area.
asid The address space identifier associated with the control block or save area.
System action: Register save area trace format processing for the current save area chains is terminated. Subsequent
save area processing will vary depending on the specific control block or save area that was available, and the DB2
Agent execution environments at the time of the error.
System programmer response: Due to the execution structures and environmental restrictions of selected DB2 and
MVS control structures, some control blocks and save areas associated with these execution environments will not be
included in the dump data set.
Problem determination: During MVS/RTM recovery processing, IFC Dump Services attempts to include all control
blocks (both DB2 and MVS), and the pertinent DB2 save areas in the dump data set, regardless of the type of error.
Control blocks and save areas associated with the following address spaces at time of error will be included in the
dump data set:
v Primary, Secondary, and Home address spaces.
v DB2 System Services and Database Services address spaces.
DSNW108I UNABLE TO AUTOMATICALLY START type TRACE
Explanation: System parameters indicated that a DB2 trace should be started automatically during DB2 subsystem
initialization, but the DB2 subsystem was unable to start the trace. A nonzero return code was received from the
-START TRACE command.
System action: Subsystem initialization continues.
Operator response: Start the trace via the -START TRACE command after DB2 subsystem initialization is complete.
DSNW109I TRACE INITIALIZATION PARAMETERS UNAVAILABLE, DEFAULTS ASSUMED
Explanation: The trace function was unable to access the trace initialization parameters defined by the DSN6SYSP
macro. Default values as defined by that macro are assumed for trace parameters.
System action: Subsystem initialization continues.
Operator response: Determine if the system parameters module DSNZPARM is missing or inaccessible. If not,
determine if the CSECT DSN6SYSP is missing. Trace can be started with the -START TRACE command.
DSNW120I A SPECIFIED keyword VALUE IS INVALID FOR trace-type TRACE
Explanation: A trace command has been entered, but a specified keyword value is not valid for the trace type
requested.
System action: Processing for the TRACE command is terminated.
Operator response: If a -START TRACE command was entered, specify a valid destination for the trace. Otherwise,
issue a -DISPLAY TRACE command to determine what traces are currently active.
Problem determination: Obtain a copy of the system or terminal log to verify command entry.

DSNW121I A SPECIFIED CLASS VALUE IS INVALID FOR trace-type TRACE
Explanation: A trace command has been entered, but a specified class value is not valid for the trace type requested.
System action: Processing for the TRACE command is terminated.
Operator response: If a -START TRACE command was entered, specify a valid class for the trace. Otherwise, issue a
-DISPLAY TRACE command to determine what options are currently active.
Problem determination: Obtain a copy of the system or terminal log to verify command entry.

-DISPLAY TRACE (DB2) (DB2 Commands)
DSNW122I THE KEYWORD invalid-keyword IS NOT VALID FOR trace-type TRACE
Explanation: A trace command has been entered, but invalid-keyword is not valid for the trace type specified.
System action: Processing for the trace command is terminated.
Operator response: Omit the specified keyword from the trace command, or specify a different type of trace.
Problem determination: Obtain a copy of the system or terminal log to verify command entry.
Related concepts:
Types of DB2 traces (DB2 Performance)
Related reference:
-START TRACE (DB2) (DB2 Commands)
-MODIFY TRACE (DB2) (DB2 Commands)
DSNW123I csect-name TRACE RECORDING HAS BEEN RESUMED ON dest
Explanation: 'dest' destination resumes acceptance of trace data after a failure.
System action: Data recording is resumed.
DSNW124I csect-name type TRACE TERMINATED RC=code RMID=nn
Explanation: During processing 'type' trace, processing abended due to an error. A trace type of blank indicates all
tracing has stopped. 'RMID', displayed in decimal, identifies the resource manager. 'RC', displayed in hexadecimal,
specifies the return/reason/abend code associated with the action.
Further collection of the named trace is stopped. If it is necessary to resume collection of the trace, a -START TRACE
command may be issued. However if another failure is experienced, the problem should be resolved before starting
the trace collection again.
System action: Processing for the named trace type is stopped. The message is not externalized by the functional
recovery routine, but is outputted whenever a IFC event is driven at a later time. A trace type of blank indicates all
tracing has stopped.
Operator response: If necessary to collect the named trace, issue a -START TRACE command to resume processing.
User response: Investigate the reasons for the failure.
Problem determination: Obtain a copy of the system or terminal log. If a dump was produced, have it printed.
Print a copy of the contents of the SYS1.LOGREC for the time period involved. Forward these items along with a
copy of the system log to the system programmer.
DSNW125I MULTIPLE ENTRIES NOT ALLOWED FOR constraint-option AND constraint-option
Explanation: A trace command contained multiple values for the indicated options. When used separately, both
options permit multiple values. However, when two or more constraint options are used together, only one can
contain multiple values.
constraint-option
The name of the constraint option. Message DSNW125I identifies the first two constraint options that
contain multiple values. The command might contain additional constraint options that contain multiple
values, but they are not listed.
System action: Command processing is terminated.
Operator response: Rewrite the command so that only one of the constraint options specifies multiple values.
For example, the following command would cause message DSNW125I:
Incorrect command:
START TRACE ACCTG PLAN(a,b,c) AUTHID (d,e)
Instead, issue two commands, where each command contains a different user ID:
Correct commands:
START TRACE ACCTG PLAN(a,b,c) AUTHID (d)
START TRACE ACCTG PLAN(a,b,c) AUTHID (e)
In some cases, it might be more efficient to use the corresponding filtering option instead of the constraint option.
Filtering options with multiple values can be used in conjunction with a constraint option that has multiple values.
Referring to the preceding example, you could issue this command, where the command uses XAUTHID to
enumerate all users other than d and e:
Correct command:
START TRACE ACCTG PLAN(a,b,c) XAUTHID (f,g)
Make sure that no other constraint options in the command contain multiple values.
Problem determination: If the cause of message DSNW125I is not immediately obvious, obtain a copy of the system
or terminal log to verify the command entry.

-DISPLAY TRACE (DB2) (DB2 Commands)
-MODIFY TRACE (DB2) (DB2 Commands)
-STOP TRACE (DB2) (DB2 Commands)
DSNW126I type TRACE NOT ALLOWED, ACTIVE TRACE TABLE FULL
Explanation: The 'type' trace cannot be started because the active trace table is has reached the maximum number of
active traces allowed.
System action: Processing for the TRACE command is terminated.
Operator response: Use the -DISPLAY TRACE command to see if an active trace could be stopped. An active trace
must be stopped before any other start trace command will be processed.
Problem determination: Obtain a copy of the system or terminal log to verify command entry.
DSNW127I CURRENT TRACE ACTIVITY IS
Explanation:
This message displays output from the DISPLAY TRACE command. The format of the output depends
on the value of the DETAIL option that was specified on the command.
If you specify DETAIL(1), DETAIL (1,2) or DETAIL(*) or do not specify the DETAIL option, the DISPLAY TRACE
output includes the following summary information. The line that begins with trace-number is displayed once for each
qualifying trace.

DSNW130I type TRACE STARTED, ASSIGNED TRACE NUMBER tno
Explanation: 'type' trace has been started and assigned the decimal trace number 'tno'. Multiple messages are
possible when the start request specifies multiple plans or multiple authorization ids.
System action: Processing for the -START TRACE command will continue.
DSNW131I STOP TRACE SUCCESSFUL FOR TRACE NUMBER(S) tno,...
Explanation: The trace number(s), 'tno,...', have been stopped. Up to five decimal trace numbers may be listed. If
more than five traces have been stopped, then another DSNW131I message is sent.
System action: Processing for the -STOP TRACE command will continue.
DSNW132I MODIFY TRACE SUCCESSFUL FOR TRACE NUMBER(S) tno,...
Explanation: The trace numbers, 'tno,...', have been modified. Up to five numbers may be listed. If more than five
traces have been modified, then another DSNW131I message is sent.
System action: Processing for the modify command will continue.
DSNW133I csect-name TRACE DATA LOST, destination NOT ACCESSIBLE RC=return-code
Explanation: The specified destination stopped accepting trace data during a trace. A condition external to DB2
caused the data to be rejected.
This message is also issued if a START TRACE command is entered from the console or from the DB2I commands
panel to an unassigned OPn or OPX destination. The reason is because the OP destination is not activated until an
application program claims the buffer. DB2 begins writing trace records to the buffer when an application program
issues START TRACE to this same OP buffer destination.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
destination
The location to which the trace data is sent. destination can be one of the following values:
RES Resident trace table
GTF z/OS generalized trace facility
OPn Destination for trace output
SMF System management facility
SRV Serviceability routine
return-code
The reason for the failure. Depending on the destination value, return-code contains one of the following
values:
GTF The hexadecimal return code from the GTF request.
04 The GTF trace, USR tracing, or both are not active.
OPn The hexadecimal return code from the OPn request or OPX request.
04 No OPn buffer is assigned to an application to collect data.
08 The OPn buffer to which the records were to be written is full. All subsequent records that
are intended for the buffer are lost.
SMF The hexadecimal return code from SMF. See Return codes (z/OS MVS System Management
Facilities).
SRV The hexadecimal return code from the SRV request.
10 The serviceability routine is absent.
xx The serviceability routine return code.
System action: Trace processing continues. However, data is lost.
Operator response: You can use the START TRACE command to record the data at another destination. You can
also use the DISPLAY TRACE command to show what types of data were recorded at the specified destination.
For GTF or SMF errors, investigate the facility to determine why data is not being accepted.
For OPX errors with a return-code value of 8, take one or more of the following actions:
v Increase the size of the OPn buffer.
v Issue the IFI READA request more frequently so that the OPx buffer is read and the content is cleared before
buffer storage is exhausted.
Problem determination: Obtain a copy of the system or terminal log to verify the command.

Explanation: 'type' trace was already active with trace number 'tno'.
System action: Processing for the -START TRACE command will continue.
DSNW137I SPECIFIED TRACE NOT ACTIVE
Explanation: The trace that was specified on the STOP TRACE command or the DISPLAY TRACE command was
not found in the active trace table.
System action: Command processing continues.
Operator response: Consider issuing an unqualified DISPLAY TRACE command to determine all of the active trace
entries. If no traces are active, DB2 returns this message (DSNW137I) again.

DSNW138I IFCID ifcid-number IS INVALID
Explanation: The specified IFCID number is outside the range of valid IFCID numbers or is an IFCID number
which is not allowed on a trace command.
System action: Processing of the trace command is terminated before any trace functions are performed.
Operator response: Investigate the reason for the problem.
Problem determination: Remove any non-valid IFCID values and reissue the command.

DSNW139I AUTHORIZATION FAILURE BECAUSE privilege-name PRIVILEGE REQUIRED FOR TRACE NUMBER(S) trace-number
Explanation: The user of the command does not have the required authorization privilege to execute the command
that was specified for the trace-number trace entries. Up to five trace numbers can appear in a single message.
Multiple messages might be issued when the required authorization privilege is missing for multiple trace numbers.
privilege-name
The name of the privilege.
trace-number
The trace number that requires an authorization privilege.
System action: Command processing is stopped.
Operator response: Notify the security administrator.
User response: Notify the security administrator.
Problem determination: Obtain a copy of the command input and verify the user's current authorization from the
DB2 subsystem catalog.
DSNW140I ALL OPN DESTINATIONS ARE ASSIGNED
Explanation: The request could not be processed because destinations OP1 - OP8 were assigned.
System action: Processing of the trace command is terminated before any trace functions are performed.
Operator response: Investigate the reason for the problem by doing a display trace to analyze the active traces.
User response: Investigate the reason for the failure.
Problem determination: Analyze why all the OPn destinations are active after doing a display trace.
DSNW141I STORAGE NOT AVAILABLE FOR BUFFER SIZE size K BYTES
Explanation: The request could not be processed because storage cannot be obtained for the OPn destination storage
buffer.
System action: Processing of the trace command is terminated.
Operator response: Investigate the reason for the problem by doing a display trace to analyze the active traces.
User response: Investigate the reason for the failure.
Problem determination: The problem is caused either because one or more prior start traces to an OPn destination
used all the storage in the IFC OPn storage pool or because ECSA contiguous storage was not available. The IFC OPn
storage pool limit is approximately 4 megabytes. When a trace is stopped the buffer storage is not free. If another
start trace is issued to the same destination, the storage will be reused. If the requested storage is greater than the
current unassigned buffer, it is free and a larger buffer is obtained. If the requested storage is less than the current
unassigned buffer, the buffer is reused. Fragmentation can occur if either application programs or an operator specify
numerous start commands for varying size buffers.
DSNW142I SPECIFIED BUFSIZE IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH ASSIGNED BUFFER
Explanation: The request could not be processed because the start trace command specified a BUFSIZE value for an
OPn destination which has a buffer already assigned with a different BUFSIZE.
System action: Processing of the trace command is terminated.
Operator response: Investigate the reason for the problem.
User response: Investigate the reason for the failure.
Problem determination: The problem may be caused by one application program attempting to start a trace to a
destination owned by another program. This is a site problem and can be solved by having application programs
start traces to an OPX destination rather than a specific OPn destination. If only one application program is starting
traces, then the program should either specify the same BUFSIZE for all requests or should not specify BUFSIZE.
DSNW143I CURRENT TRACE QUALIFICATIONS ARE -
Explanation: This message is part of the output from the DISPLAY TRACE command, which is described in
message DSNW127I on page 958.
DSNW148I ***END OF DISPLAY TRACE QUALIFICATION DATA***
Explanation: This message is part of the output from the DISPLAY TRACE command, which is described in
message DSNW127I on page 958.
DSNW149I STOP TRACE COMMAND WAS UNSUCCESSFUL BECAUSE MONITOR TRACE CLASS 6 IS ACTIVE FOR QUALIFYING TRACE NUMBER(S) class-number,...
Explanation: No traces were stopped by the -STOP TRACE command. Either -STOP TRACE(*) or -STOP
TRACE(MON) CLASS(*) was issued when monitor trace class 6 was active. An asterisk (*) is not allowed for the
TRACE and CLASS keywords when monitor trace class 6 is active. The trace numbers, class-number, indicate the
traces that met any other specified -STOP TRACE qualifying criteria (PLAN, AUTHID, RMID, LOCATION, TNO)
and also activated monitor trace class 6, thereby preventing all qualifying traces from being stopped. This special
handling of the asterisk on the -STOP TRACE command for monitor trace class 6 reduces the possibility of
accidentally stopping monitor trace class 6, which enables and disables DB2 data propagation.
System action: No traces are stopped. Processing of the -STOP TRACE command is terminated.
Operator response: If you do not want DB2 data propagation capability, you can stop monitor trace class 6 to allow
full use of the asterisk. First stop the traces indicated by the trace numbers, class-number, and then reissue the
command.
If you want DB2 data propagation capability, do not stop monitor trace class 6. You must specify the trace TYPE. You
can stop traces without specifying the trace CLASS as long as the trace TYPE is not (MON). If the trace TYPE is
(MON), then you must specify the CLASS keyword explicitly (for example, -STOP TRACE(MON) CLASS(1,2)).
User response: Reissue the -STOP TRACE command without using an asterisk for the trace type. You can use a
asterisk for the CLASS keyword to stop all trace types except the monitor (MON) trace.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.

Explanation: A START, STOP, OR DISPLAY trace command has been entered that would result in greater than 16
qualifications for a trace entry.
System action: Processing of the command is terminated.
Operator response: Reduce the number of trace qualifications specified. Refer to the DB2 Command Reference for
details about trace qualifications.
DSNW182I csect AN INTERNAL STOP HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR TRACE NUMBER traceno BECAUSE THE OP BUFFER OWNER HAS TERMINATED
Explanation: This message is issued when the thread that owns the OP buffer terminates. DB2 has stopped the trace
that you specified because the trace was started with exclusively OP buffer destinations. OP buffer destinations
require a valid owning thread. DB2 may also issue an internal stop for traces started with a combination of OP and
non-OP destinations. This occurs when an internal modify results in a duplicate trace entry.
DSNW183I csect AN INTERNAL MODIFY HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR TRACE NUMBER traceno BECAUSE THE OP BUFFER OWNER HAS TERMINATED. TRACE NUMBER traceno REMAINS ACTIVE USING DESTINATIONS dest1, dest2, ...
Explanation: This message is issued when the thread that owns the OP buffer terminates. The trace traceno remains
active using only the destinations specified. OP buffer destinations have been stopped because these destinations
require a valid owning thread.
DSNW184I csect OP BUFFER opbuff NOT AVAILABLE
Explanation: This message is issued when a -START TRACE command has DEST(OP1-8) specified. The thread
issuing the -START TRACE command does not currently own an in use buffer opbuff or the values in IFCAOWNER,
IFCAGLBL, and WBUFECB do not match the values that are specified by previously started traces.
System action: Processing for the -START TRACE command is terminated.
Operator response: Change the DEST keyword to one of the following:
v OPX
v an OPX buffer that is owned by the current thread
v an OP buffer that is not in use

DSNX103I bind-type SQL WARNING USING authorization-id AUTHORITY PLAN=plan-id DBRM=dbrm name STATEMENT=statement number BIND ISOLATION LEVEL RR CONFLICTS WITH TABLESPACE LOCKSIZE PAGE OR LOCKSIZE ROW
Explanation: Because of the possible inconsistency between the isolation level of the application and the LOCKSIZE
of the table space, table space locking is used to protect the integrity of the application.
bind-type
Type of BIND subcommand that caused the warning: BIND or REBIND
authorization-id
Authorization ID used during the bind process. For a BIND subcommand, it is the authorization ID of the
plan owner. For a REBIND subcommand, it is the authorization ID of the owner specified by the
subcommand, or the latest owner of the plan. If this is a remote operation, and the OWNER was not
specified in the subcommand, then REMOTE OWNER is output.

Explanation: An SQL warning code was generated while processing an SQL statement.
bind-type
The type of subcommand that caused the warning: BIND or REBIND
authorization-id
Indicates the authorization ID used during the bind process. For a BIND subcommand, it is the
authorization ID of the plan owner. For a REBIND subcommand, it is the authorization ID of the owner
specified by the subcommand, or the latest owner of the plan. If this is a remote operation, and the OWNER
was not specified in the subcommand, then REMOTE OWNER is output.
Attention: If you are using a trusted context, the token auth-id might return a role instead of an
authorization ID. A role is returned if a role was in effect and the authorization checking is performed
against the role, rather than the authorization ID of the session, when the condition was encountered.
Otherwise an authorization ID is returned. A role is returned in the following format as a single token:
v ROLE: role-name
plan-id Name of the application plan specified in the BIND subcommand. If the application plan is not specified,
this field is blank.
sqlcode
A product specific code which identifies the particular SQL warning condition.

DSNX202I INVALID AMODE ATTRIBUTE FOUND FOR DATE OR TIME INSTALLATION REPLACEABLE EXIT ROUTINE module-name
Explanation: During DB2 startup, the Relational Data System subcomponent loads the Date (DSNXVDTX) and Time
(DSNXVTMX) exit routines. These routines must have the link-edited attributes AMODE(31) and RMODE(ANY). The
module listed in the message 'module-name' did not have the correct addressing attributes. If the date and time
LOCAL installation option is specified, DB2 cannot execute the date and time functions required by the exit routine
that failed to load.
System action: The load module is deleted. DB2 startup continues.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: When DB2 is stopped, the date and time exit routine must be link-edited again with
the correct AMODE and RMODE control statements.

DSNX203I LOAD OF THE DATE OR TIME INSTALLATION REPLACEABLE EXIT ROUTINE module-name FAILED WITH MVS ABEND CODE = abend-code REASON CODE = reason-code DB2 STARTUP WILL CONTINUE
Explanation: During DB2 startup, the Relational Data System subcomponent loads the date (DSNXVDTX) and time
(DSNXVTMX) exit routines. During the load of EXIT ROUTINE 'module-name', MVS issued the abend code and
reason code that would cause abnormal termination of the task, but the abend was suppressed. If the date and time
LOCAL option is specified, DB2 will be unable to execute the date and time functions required by the exit routine
that failed to load.
System action: The load failed. DB2 startup continues.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.

DSNX204I csect-name ERROR LOADING THE DB2 CATALOG, REASON reason: DB2 STARTED ACCESS(MAINT)
Explanation: The internal structure (DBD) for the catalog database (DSNDB06) was either not found or was
inconsistent when DB2 was started. See the appropriate reason for a more detailed description of the problem.
The value for reason is one of the following reason codes:
0 An error occurred reading the DBD01 table space. Check the Console for messages and SYS1.LOGREC for
abends.
1 The expected level of the DBD for DSNDB06 is the previous release, but objects exist in the DBD for a
current or later release.
2 The expected level of the DBD for DSNDB06 is the current release, but objects exist in the DBD for a later
release.
3 The expected level of the DBD for DSNDB06 is a later release, but objects do not exist in the DBD for a later
release.
4 The level of the DBD for DSNDB06 is unknown to this version of DB2.
The mode is one of the following:
* The DB01 tablespace could not be opened. Code/Catalog checks are deferred until it can be opened.
MAINT
The DB01 tablespace could be opened and a problem was detected. Prohibits access to any authorization IDs
other than installation SYSADM and installation SYSOPR.
System action: DB2 was started ACCESS(MAINT).
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
System programmer response: DB2 was started in ACCESS(mode). Do not run any CREATES, ALTERS, DROPS,
GRANTs, REVOKEs or BINDs when in this state; it might corrupt your catalog and directory. Determine the problem
with the DSNDB01.DBD01 table space. An improper REPAIR or RECOVER of the table space might have been run.
Fix the problem while in ACCESS(MAINT) mode and then stop and start DB2.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).

DSNX206I LOAD OF THE ACCESS CONTROL AUTHORIZATION INSTALLATION REPLACEABLE EXIT ROUTINE module-name FAILED WITH MVS ABEND CODE = abend-code AND REASON CODE = reason-code DB2 STARTUP WILL CONTINUE
Explanation: During DB2 startup, the Relational Data System subcomponent loads the Access Control Authorization
(DSNX@XAC) exit routine. During the load of EXIT ROUTINE module-name, MVS issued the abend code and reason
code that indicates abnormal termination of the task. However, the abend was suppressed. DB2 will not use the
Access Control Authorization (DSNX@XAC) exit to perform authorization checking. DB2 authorization checking will
be performed.
System action: The load failed. DB2 startup continues.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: After DB2 has stopped, you must properly link-edit the Access Control
Authorization exit routine. \

DSNX208E csect-name ATTEMPTING TO START DB2 WITH AN UNSUPPORTED CODE LEVEL. REASON CODE reason MISSING MAINTENANCE: maint CURRENT LEVEL current-code-level VALID LEVEL(S) valid-code-levels
Explanation: The DB2 member that is starting has a code level that is not compatible with the catalog or with some
other component of DB2.
reason indicates the problem:
1 DB2 is attempting to start with a level of code that is not valid. The missing maintenance, maint, is
unknown.
2 The level of code that is required by the catalog, which is indicated by current-code-level, is not a valid code
level. The missing maintenance, maint, is unknown.
3 A preconditioning or toleration APAR has not been applied. The required APAR or level of code is specified
by maint.
4 The preconditioning or toleration maintenance is on the DB2 subsystem, but maintenance to the catalog that
is specified by maint, has not been applied.
maint is an APAR number or a token that indicates a level of code. The value of maint is UNKNOWN if DB2 cannot
determine the missing maintenance level.
current-code-level and valid-code-levels are for the use of your IBM service representative.
This message can occur in the following situations:
v The starting DB2 fell back from a later release and does not have the proper maint applied.
v The starting DB2 does not have the proper coexistence SPE, specified by maint, to start in a data sharing group,
which is at a later release level.
v The starting DB2 is at a release in which coexistence with the data sharing group is not supported.
System action: DB2 terminates with reason code 00E7009D.
System programmer response: Verify that:
v Coexistence is supported between the releases you are trying to run.
v The DB2 startup procedure points to the correct set of load libraries.
v The correct SPE has been applied.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Contents of the BSDS (both copies if dual BSDS in use) obtained by using the DB2 print log map (DSNJU004)
utility.
DSNX209E csect-name MEMBER member-name IS AT A CODE LEVEL WHICH IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THIS STARTING OR MIGRATING MEMBER. REQUIRED LEVEL: new-code-level KNOWN LEVELS: known-code-levels
Explanation: The DB2 member that is starting will update the DB2 catalog, but the code level of that DB2 member
is not compatible with the code level of the DB2 member that has already started. The DB2 subsystem at the earlier
code level requires the correct SPE. The code level information in this message is for the use of your IBM service
representative.
System action: DB2 terminates with reason code 00E7009D after detecting the DB2 members that cannot coexist.
System programmer response: Check the DB2 Program Directory and Preventive Service Planning updates (PSP)
for more information about the SPE that is needed.
Verify that:
v Coexistence is supported between the releases you are trying to run.
v The DB2 startup procedure points to the correct set of load libraries.
v The correct SPE has been applied to all active members in the group.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Contents of the BSDS (both copies if dual BSDS in use) obtained by using the DB2 print log map (DSNJU004)
utility.

Guide and Reference to locate the inconsistent DBD in the DSNDB01.DBD01 page set.
DSNX210I csect-name - ACCESS CONTROL AUTHORIZATION EXIT ROUTINE (DSNX@XAC) HAS
INDICATED THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE CALLED, HAS ABENDED OR HAS RETURNED AN
INVALID RETURN CODE DURING function-code. RETURN CODE=return-code REASON
CODE=reason-code. CUMULATIVE ABENDS DURING EXIT PROCESSING=abend-count. EXIT
ROUTINE STATUS: stopped-running.
Explanation: This message is issued during the initialization (DB2 startup) call or during an authorization check call
to the exit routine, as identified by the function-code. The return-code and reason-code are returned in fields EXPLRC1
and EXPLRC2 of the EXPL parameter list for the exit routine.
This message is issued under the following circumstances:
Initialization
v The version of the exit routine is incompatible with this version of DB2.
v The exit routine returned an invalid code.
v The exit routine terminated abnormally during initialization.
v The exit routine returned-code is 12 indicating that it cannot perform authorization checks and should not
be called.
In all of these cases the exit routine is stopped, as indicated by stopped- running=STOPPED.
Authorization checking
v The exit routine returned an invalid return code.
v The return code from the exit routine indicates that it cannot perform authorization checks and should not
be called.
v The exit routine terminated abnormally during initialization.
System action: DB2 performs different actions, depending on whether this error occurs during DB2 startup or
during an authorization check:
Initialization - DB2 startup:
v If the version of the exit routine is incompatible with this version of DB2, an abend with code 00E70016
occurs and DB2 terminates.
v If the return-code is 12 or an unexpected value, then:
C If reason_code is 16, an abend with code 00E70015 occurs and DB2 terminates.
C If reason_code is not 16, an abend with code 00E70009 occurs, DB2 performs all subsequent
authorization checks, and the exit is not called again.
v If an abend occurs during exit routine processing:
C If the reason_code is 16, DB2 terminates.
C If the reason_code is not 16, DB2 performs all subsequent authorization checks, and the exit is not called
again.
Authorization check:
v If the return-code is 12 or an unexpected value, then:
C If the initialization reason_code was 16, an abend with code 00E70015 occurs and DB2 terminates.
C If the initialization reason_code was not 16, an abend with code 00E70009 occurs, DB2 performs all
subsequent authorization checks, and the exit is not called again.
v If an abend occurs during exit routine processing, a certain number of abends are tolerated before the exit
stops being called. Subsystem parameter AEXITLIM (AUTH EXIT LIMIT) determines this limit. The exit
routine will continue running until it exceeds the abend tolerance limit. In addition, the following will
occur:
C If the initialization reason_code was 16, DB2 terminates.
C If the initialization reason_code was not 16, DB2 performs all subsequent authorization checks.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Refer to the documentation of the access control authorization exit routine for an
explanation of reason_code. Correct the situation that caused the reason code.
If this message was issued because of an abend during exit routine processing, then search the system log to
determine its cause and correct the situation.
If abend code 00E70016 was issued indicating that the version of the exit routine is incompatible with this version of
DB2, install the correct version of the exit routine. Refer to the documentation in the Administration Guide for
information on the access control authorization exit. For information on the RACF access control module shipped
with DB2 refer to the RACF Access Control Module Guide.
If DB2 terminated, restart DB2. If DB2 did not terminate, you need to restart DB2 to reactivate the exit.
Problem determination: Since the access control authorization exit routine is external to DB2, refer to the
documentation of the exit routine for an explanation of return_code and reason_code and a resolution to the problem.
If this message was issued because of an abend during exit routine processing, then determine the cause of the abend
from messages in the system log and address it. Look for system messages that occurred at approximately the same
time to find more information about the abend.
DSNX211I LOAD OF THE ICSF LOAD MODULE module-name FAILED WITH THE RETURN CODE return-code AND REASON CODE reason-code DB2 STARTUP CONTINUES.
Explanation: DB2 cannot load the ICSF load module module-name. Refer to the z/OS ICSF documentation for
explanations of the return-code reason code.
System action: DB2 startup continues but the encryption/decryption services are not available.
User response: Ensure that the ICSF SCSFMOD0 load module is in the LINKLIST for the z/OS system.
DSNX230I A RESOURCE IS UNAVAILABLE WHEN TRYING TO BUILD THE TRUSTED CONTEXT CACHE REASON=reason-code TYPE OF RESOURCE=resource-type RESOURCE NAME=resource-name
Explanation: During DB2 startup or at the first attempt to create a connection or at a commit related to the
TRUSTED CONTEXT DDL statements, an error is encountered while building the trusted context cache and accessing
the catalog.
reason-code
The reason code returned by Data Manager during DB2 catalog access.
resource-type
The resource type returned by Data Manager during DB2 catalog access.
resource-name
The resource name returned by Data Manager during DB2 catalog access.
An attempt to rebuild the trusted context cache will be made at the next DB2 startup, or during commit for the
TRUSTED CONTEXT related DDL statements or attempt to establish a connection.
System action: The trusted context cache is not built and subsequent connections are not trusted connections, until
the problem is resolved. DB2 startup continues if the console message is issued during the startup. If the message is
issued during a remote connect attempt to use the trusted connection, SQLCODE +20360 is returned. If the message
is issued when DSN ASUSER is specified, DSNE137I message is returned.
If the message is issued during the commit for TRUSTED CONTEXT related DDL statements, the DB2 catalog is
updated, but the trusted context cache is not updated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: The message is issued when an error is encountered while trying to access the
catalog tablespace, DSNDB06.SYSCONTX. The reason code indicates the cause of the failure. Verify the identity of the
resource that was not available. Check if there is any prior abend messages in the console. If you suspect an error in
DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see
Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
DSNX231I THE TRUSTED CONTEXT CACHE BUILD PROCESS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
Explanation: The trusted context cache is built successfully with trusted context entries in the DB2 catalog. DB2 uses
the trusted context cache to determine if a connection is trusted or not.
System action: DB2 is ready for trusted context connections.
DSNX232E A RESOURCE IS UNAVAILABLE WHEN TRYING TO DETERMINE IF AUDIT POLICIES ARE TO BE STARTED DURING DB2 START UP REASON=reason-code TYPE OF RESOURCE=resource-type RESOURCE NAME=resource-name

The schema name for the stored procedures that are included in the output.
The schema name and lines that follow are repeated as many times as needed to satisfy the DISPLAY
PROCEDURE request.
PROCEDURE procedure
The name of the stored procedure.
One line of output is included for each requested stored procedure.
STATUS status
The status of the stored procedure. The status can be any of the following values:
STARTED
The stored procedure can accept SQL CALL requests.
STOPABN
The stored procedure was stopped because of a previous abnormal termination of the stored
procedure application. SQL CALL requests for the stored procedure are rejected.
STOPQUE
The stored procedure was stopped. SQL CALL requests for the stored procedure are queued until
the stored procedure is started or the timeout interval that is defined by the STORTIME subsystem
parameter expires.
STOPREJ
The stored procedure was placed in this status by the STOP PROCEDURE command with the
ACTION(REJECT) option. SQL CALL requests for the stored procedure are rejected.
If the stored procedure is in any of the stopped states, you can use the START PROCEDURE command to
start the procedure.

scheduled since DB2 was started.
An SQL CALL statement can time out for any of the following reasons:
v The procedure can be stopped by the STOP PROCEDURE command with the ACTION(QUEUE) option.
This specification causes requests for the procedure to time out after the interval that is defined by the
STORTIME subsystem parameter is exceeded.
v The DB2 stored procedures address space might not have enough MVS TCBs to handle the volume of
SQL CALL statements.
v The MVS dispatching priority of the DB2 stored procedures address space might be too low to process the
stored procedure requests in a timely manner.
FAIL fail
The number of times that this procedure abended since it was last started.
WLM_ENV wlm_env
The MVS Workload Manager environment name for this stored procedure.
csect-name

Error messages:
The following messages in the DISPLAY PROCEDURE output indicate that an error occurred:
csect-name PROCEDURE HAS NOT BEEN ACCESSED OR IS NOT DEFINED
The routine name that was supplied on the DISPLAY PROCEDURE command either does not exist or has
not been accessed since DB2 started. The specific procedure name might not be present in the
SYSIBM.SYSROUTINES catalog table.
Processing continues for any additional routine names that were supplied on the command.
DISPLAY TERMINATED WITH MAX LINES
The DISPLAY PROCEDURE report was truncated. The report was generated in response to a command from
an MVS console, and more than 254 messages were generated. Only 254 messages are returned.
Command processing completes. The truncated report is written to the MVS console.
Reissue the DISPLAY PROCEDURE command and specify a smaller number of routines. Specify a list of
routines, a schema qualifier, or a partial routine name in the DISPLAY command rather than the default (*.*).

the command, verify that the SYSOPR ID is granted the necessary privileges at the remote member.
DSNX960E csect-name SOME SQL CALL STATEMENTS CANNOT BE PROCESSED, BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE ENVIRONMENT ROUTINE CEEPIPI CANNOT BE LOADED SSN= ssn PROC= jclproc ASID= asid WLM_ENV= wlmenv
Explanation: To execute an SQL CALL statement, DB2 must load the Language Environment interface module
(CEEPIPI). If the CEEPIPI module is not included in an accessible data set such as STEPLIB data sets, JOBLIB data
sets, or the LPA library, DB2 is unable to call Language Environment to process stored procedure or function
requests.
ssn The name of the DB2 subsystem to which the stored procedures address space was connected.
ssn The name of the JCL PROC used to start this stored procedures address space.
asid The MVS ASID of the address space where the load was issued.
wlmenv The name of the WLM application environment where the load was issued.
System action: The address space attempting to process stored procedures or functions terminates.
System programmer response: Change the STEPLIB DD statement in the JCL used to start the stored procedure
address space, or install the CEEPIPI module in one of the libraries already accessible to the address space.
After the CEEPIPI module is accessible,restart the failing stored procedure address space. If the error was in a
WLM-established stored procedures address space, use the MVS VARY WLM,APPLENV=name,RESUME command.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
DSNX961I csect-name ATTEMPT TO PERFORM OPERATION operation FAILED FOR ROUTINE routine-name SSN=ssn PROC=jclproc ASID=asid CLASS=class-name METHOD=method-name ERROR INFO=error-information
Explanation: A WLM-established JAVA stored procedures address space could not perform a necessary operation.
The following list contains the possible values for each variable in the message:
operation
The operation that failed. The following list contains the operations that could have failed:
v CallStaticMethod
v CreateDebugJVM
v CreateJavaVM
v DEBUG_ROUTINE
v DestroyJavaVM
v FindClass
v INTERNAL_ERROR
v JDBC Reset
routine-name
The name of the routine that was invoked.
ssn
The name of the DB2 subsystem to which the stored procedures address space is connected.
jclproc
The name of the JCL procedure that was used to start the stored procedures address space.
asid
The ASID of the address space in which operation was performed.
class-name
The name of the class that contains the Java method to be invoked.
method-name
The name of the Java method to be invoked.
error-information
The error information provided for this error.
System action: Either the CALL statement fails, or, in the case of operations DEBUG_ROUTINE and
CreateDebugJVM, the CALL statement executes but the Java stored procedure cannot be debugged.
System programmer response: Use the value of operation and this message's error-information to correct the problem.
If the WLM-managed stored procedure address space is running with a //JSPDEBUG DD card, then, for further
information about this error, check its output (typically, the WLM-managed stored procedure address space output)
for information.
Also, check the HFS directory identified as the home directory for the ID associated with the WLM-managed stored
procedure address space for any dumps that the JVM could have taken. Check either the /tmp/java directory, or if
WORK_DIR is specified then its directory, for information that could have been written to file server_stderr.txt.
CallStaticMethod
This operation indicates that an exception has taken place that was not a Java SQLException.
CreateDebugJVM
This operation indicates that the JVM could not be created in debug mode. Debugging of Java stored procedures
can only be performed on routines running in a WLM-managed stored procedure address space whose
NUMTCB value is 1.
CreateJavaVM
This operation indicates that the JVM could not be created. You must have the IBM Developer Kit for OS/390,
Java 2 Technology Edition, and the JAVA_HOME environmental variable in your JAVAENV data set must
reference its home directory.
DEBUG_ROUTINE
This operation indicates that the WLM-managed stored procedure address space could not establish or maintain
proper communication with a debug session. This message's error-information describes how the operation failed
and provides an associated reason code. For all cases except for "ReservePort Failure: NO AVAILABLE PORT"
record the information in this message's error-information and contact your IBM Support Center for assistance. In
the case of "ReservePort Failure: NO AVAILABLE PORT" either wait for the simultaneous debugging activity to
decrease or increase the number of ports available to the WLM-managed stored procedure address space.
DestroyJavaVM
This operation indicates that the JVM could not be destroyed without error.
FindClass
This operation indicates that either a required system-provided class could not be found or an error occurred in
accessing a system- or user-provided class. You need to take a specific action based on what type of class could
not be found or accessed:
v For a system-provided class, check the settings for JAVA_HOME, and JCC_HOME in the JAVAENV DD
statement in the stored procedures address space start-up procedure, and ensure that they are set correctly.
v For a user-provided class, check the settings for TMSUFFIX and CLASSPATH in the JAVAENV DD statement
in the stored procedures address space start-up procedure, and check the routine's use of an installed JAR. The
JVM run time loads all classes that are referenced in the identified class. Ensure that all referenced,
user-provided, classes are in the CLASSPATH or TMSUFFIX, or in a referenced installed JAR.
INTERNAL_ERROR
This operation indicates that an internal error has occurred. Record the following information and contact your
IBM Support Center for assistance:
v Any information reported in this message's error-information
v The results of the recommended checks of the WLM-managed stored procedure address space
v Any dumps that the JVM could have taken
v Any information written to file server_stderr.txt
JDBC Reset
This operation indicates that a specific internal error has occurred. Record the following information and contact
your IBM Support Center for assistance:
v Any information reported in this message's error-information
v The results of the recommended checks of the WLM-managed stored procedure address space
v Any dumps that the JVM could have taken
v Any information written to file server_stderr.txt
DSNX962I csect-name THE Language Environment CEEPIPI SERVICE RETURNED AN UNEXPECTED RETURN CODE rc FOR FUNCTION func SSN= ssn PROC= jclproc ASID= asid WLM_ENV= wlmenv

asid The MVS ASID of the address space where the CEEPIPI error was encountered.
wlmenv The name of the WLM application environment where the CEEPIPI error was encountered.
System action: The attempt to run a stored procedure fails. The DB2 stored procedure address space attempts any
new stored procedure requests it receives.
System programmer response: The Language Environment return codes from CEEPIPI are documented in Language
Environment for OS/390 & VM Programming Guide.
If the values of func and rc are 'ADD_ENTRY' and X'0000000C', the error might be caused by using a compiler that is
not Language Environment enabled to create the stored procedure. DB2 stored procedures must be compiled with a
compiler that supports Language Environment.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
DSNX966I csect-name STORED PROCEDURE OR FUNCTION sp FAILED. Language Environment ENCLAVE RC = erc, FEEDBACK INFORMATION = fi SSN= ssn PROC= jclproc ASID= asid WLM_ENV= wlmenv
Explanation: DB2 uses the Language Environment CEEPIPI call_main or call_sub service to execute user-written
stored procedures or user-defined function. The CEEPIPI interface returned information indicating a failure while
executing the stored procedure.
sp The stored procedure or function name that was called using CEEPIPI.
erc The Language Environment enclave return code.
fi Contains one or two message identifiers. The message identifiers are constructed from the Language
Environment condition token.
The message identifiers are constructed as follows:
v Single message: Facility_Id combined with Msg_No
v Two messages: Facility_Id combined with Class_Code and Facility_Id combined with Cause_Code
ssn The name of the DB2 subsystem that called the stored procedure or function.
jclproc The name of the JCL PROC used to start this stored procedures address space.
asid The MVS ASID of the address space where the stored procedure executed.

time that spans the failure.
v SYSABEND, SYSUDUMP, or SYSMDUMP output.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
DSNX983I csect-name DB2 STORED PROCEDURE SUPPORT CODE AND SUBSYSTEM CODE ARE NOT AT THE SAME LEVEL SSN= ssn PROC = jclproc
Explanation: A DB2 stored procedures address space could not connect to the DB2 subsystem. This occurred
because the DB2 code in the stored procedures address space was not at the same release level as the code in the
DB2 subsystem.
ssn The name of the DB2 subsystem that the stored procedure address space was attempting to connect with.
jclproc The name of the JCL PROC used to start the stored procedures address space.
System action: The stored procedures address space terminates.
System programmer response: Correct the DB2 library name in the STEPLIB for the JCL proc for the stored
procedures address space. Make the library name the same as the library name used for the DB2 subsystem address
spaces. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.

DSN1164E INVALID xxxx FOUND AT RBA = yyyyyyyyyyyy
Explanation: While processing the SUMMARY option, an invalid checkpoint record (either URE or RURE identified
by 'xxxx') was encountered in the log.
System action: Processing continues.
User response: If the checkpoint record identified in the message is used to restart DB2, the restart will fail because
DB2 will not be able to process the unit of recovery presented by the invalid URE or RURE. DB2 must be restarted
from a previous checkpoint to correctly process all units of recovery. The print log map (DSNJU004) utility can be
used to list the checkpoint records in the BSDS, and the CHKPTRBA parameter of the change log inventory
(DSNJU003) utility can be used to direct the DB2 restart to use a particular checkpoint.

DSN1215I NO LOG RECORDS WERE READ
Explanation: DSN1LOGP read no log records.
System action: Processing continues. Possible explanations:
v An error prevents DSN1LOGP from continuing, so no log records have yet been processed. If this is the case, an
error message should precede this message.
v You specified the active log data sets or archive log data sets out of RBA sequence.
v You specified a STARTRBA that is greater than any RBA in the active and/or archive data sets available.
Severity: 0 (informational)
DSN1216E csect-name DSNJSLR ERROR RETCODE = xxxxxxxx REASON CODE = yyyyyyyy seq = nnnnnnnnnnnn
Explanation: The stand-alone log read function returned an error indicating that either the log has an error in one of
the control intervals (CI) or a data set containing the requested sequence number cannot be located. The sequence
number shown in the message indicates where the error was detected.
seq RBA or LRSN
The sequence number points:
v To the start of the CI, if there is a problem with the log control interval definition (LCID), or with any of the
general control information within a CI.
v To the log record in the CI, if there is a problem with a log record header (LRH).
If this is the first log record read during this execution of DSN1LOGP, and if there is a problem with the LCID, the
sequence number is all zeros.
Before returning any records, DSN1LOGP checks the control information (LCID) at the end of a CI, and analyzes the
LRH to ensure that all records are properly chained together within the CI. If an error is detected while performing
this process, DSN1LOGP issues this message before dumping the entire CI. It will not format individual records
within the CI, but will, if possible, continue processing by reading the next CI.

DSN1218I NUMBER OF LOG ERROR MESSAGES nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
Explanation: DSN1LOGP distinguishes three classes of errors:
1. Code problems existing in the DB2 or system code used for DSN1LOGP. In the event of a SYSABEND dump, a
user abend code of U0153 will be issued, and DSN1LOGP will be terminated.
2. Incorrect invocation of DSN1LOGP caused, perhaps, by your having used an incorrect keyword or missed a DD
statement. Under these circumstances, DSN1LOGP will issue appropriate error messages, and the program will be
terminated.
3. Failure by a given log CI under the scrutiny of DSN1LOGP. Such scrutiny is performed before any of the records
within the CI are processed. Failure is an indication of logical damage, and error messages are issued by the Log
Extractor. The CI or failing log record is printed, and DSN1LOGP continues to the next CI or log record.
The count 'nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn' provided summarizes the number (in decimal) of errors DSN1LOGP detected
while accessing the log.

DSN1220E ARCHIVE LOG TRUNCATED AT xxxxxxxx - INVALID LOG RECORDS WERE READ
Explanation: At a restart of DB2, an archive log was truncated. This archive log data set could not be physically
altered to reflect this truncation, and invalid log records therefore still exist. DSN1LOGP has already reported this
information in the summary report, and cannot retract it. Nor can it disregard the invalid log information already
read in order adequately to summarize what has occurred. Therefore, all information up to this point in the log will
be summarized, and a new summary report initiated. Consequently, the same UR may be reported twice with
different dispositions and different page sets modified. To avoid this condition, use the BSDS DD statement instead of
the ARCHIVE DD statement.

4 The length of the record did not meet the minimum length for processing.
5 The offset that is specified in the self-defining section for a data section exceeds the length of the
input record.
6 An unexpected number of items were found in the data section.
System action: Program processing continues with the next input record.
Programmer response: See the problem determination section. Remove the corrupted record and try again. If the
error persists, the input data set to the program is probably corrupted.
Problem determination: If ifcid-type is UNKNOWN, the problem was found in the product section of the indicated
SMF record. Each record of SMF type 101 and 102 should contain a product section with one standard header. The
product section can also contain zero or more of the following items: a correlation header, a CPU header, a
distributed data header, a trace header, and a data sharing header. Other headers in the product section are
unexpected bythe program. The length of the record must be at least long enough to contain a writer header section,
a self-defining section, a product section, and at least one data section.
If ifcid-type is not UNKNOWN, the problem was found in a data section of the indicated SMF record. Each IFCID
should have at least one data item. The exact number depends on the IFCID type.

The CCSID from module DSNHDECP, which is the module that defines all DB2 default option values. This
value depends on the environment, and is one of the following values:
v The default EBCDIC single-byte CCSID (value of field DECPSID)
v The default EBCDIC multi-byte CCSID (value of field DECPMID)
ifcid-ccsid
The IFCID 106 record where the mismatch exists. The IFCID 106 record is identified in the DSN1404I
message that follows this message.
System action: Program processing continues. The EBCDIC CCSID in the current IFCID 106 record is used to
convert any Unicode data in that record. The program then reverts to the EBCDIC CCSID specified in the
DSNHDECP it loaded at start of execution.
Programmer response: This error indicates that the wrong DSNHDECP module was loaded by the program, or that
the program is processing trace records from more than one DB2 subsystem. If the wrong DSNHDECP module is
being used, rerun the input after supplying the correct DSNHDECP module. If input from more than one DB2
subsystem is being processed, run the program for each subsystem.

System action: Program processing continues.
Programmer response: Review the return-code value to determine whether this error is a system or setup error. If an
invalid target CCSID is indicated, verify that the EBCDIC CCSID in use by the program is valid. If this message is
preceded by message DSN1405I, the EBCDIC CCSID was obtained from the current IFCID 106 record. Otherwise, the
EBCIDIC CCSID was obtained from the DSNHDECP module that is loaded by the program at start of execution.
Confirm that the EBCDIC CCSID is the one used by the DB2 subsystem from which the SMF records were collected.
Otherwise, replace the DSNHDECP module that is used by the program with one that specifies the CCSID used by
the DB2 subsystem from which the SMF records were collected.

DSN1983I csect-name DICTIONARY IS INVALID, REASON= X'nnnn'
Explanation: The dictionary found in the data set is invalid. A DB2 internal error occurred during the validation of
the compression dictionary.
System action: Processing terminates.
System programmer response: Determine the failing environment. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need
to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting
data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: Verify that the correct data set is specified. You can delete the EXPAND option and resubmit the job.
Problem determination: The REASON identifies the nature of the error. The REASON is used for diagnostic
purposes by the IBM Support Center.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSN1984I UNEXPECTED PAGE NUMBER, EXPECTING: expected-page-number FOUND: page-number-found
Explanation: This message indicates that an unexpected page number was encountered. This message might be
received if the input data set is an image copy but you did not specify the FULLCOPY or INCRCOPY parameters.
The page numbers displayed in hexadecimal format are the page numbers that are expected and found. After this
message is issued five hundred times, it will stop being issued.
System action: Processing continues.
System programmer response: If running DSN1COPY use DSN1PRNT to dump the table space or index space.
Otherwise, analyze the DSN1PRNT output. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem.
For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Severity: 4 (warning) for DSN1PRNT or 8 (error) for DSN1COPY
DSN1985I ZERO PAGES ENCOUNTERED. FIRST PAGE = first-zero-page-number, LAST PAGE = last-zero-page-number
Explanation: One or more zero pages were found with valid data pages after them. A zero page is a page of all zeros
or a page with only the page-synchronization bit on in the first and last byte of the page.
first-zero-page-number
The page number of the page where zeros were first found. This value is displayed in hexadecimal format.
last-zero-page-number
The page number of the page where zeros were last found. This value is displayed in hexadecimal format.
In most cases, this situation is not an error condition. This condition is normal for segmented table spaces and for
index spaces that are created with a FREEPAGE value that is not equal to zero. This condition is also normal for
nonsegmented table spaces after certain update scenarios terminated abnormally and data was rolled back.
System action: Processing continues.
System programmer response: If the zero page is the result of segmenting, no action is necessary. Similarly, if the
zero page is a valid zero page that was introduced by DB2, no action is necessary. This page is free space and is used
by DB2 when needed. If the zero page is a valid zero page and you want to remove it from the table space, run the
REORG utility.
To help determine whether the zero page was validly introduced by DB2, run the CHECK INDEX utility. This action
assumes that at least one index is defined on the affected table space.
If the zero page is determined to be invalid, run the RECOVER utility.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Severity: 4 (warning)

DSN1986I NEITHER FULLCOPY NOR INCRCOPY PARAMETERS MAY BE SPECIFIED WITH THE SEGMENT PARAMETER.
Explanation: The parameters SEGMENT, FULLCOPY, and INCRCOPY describe the type of input that SYSUT1
references. SEGMENT is only relevant when a table space or index space is the input. FULLCOPY and INCRCOPY
are only relevant when a image copy is the input. If the input data set is a segmented table space, then the
FULLCOPY or INCRCOPY parameters should not be specified. If the input data set is a full or incremental image
copy, then SEGMENT should not be specified.
System action: Processing will terminate.
User response: Omit the incorrect parameter.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSN1987I csect-name INDEX PAGE CONTAINING OBID id HAS NO MATCHING VALUE IN THE SYSXLAT FILE.
Explanation: This message is issued when the OBID on the page does not find a matching value in the input source
OBID list. This message can also be issued when the input does not have enough OBID values.
System action: Processing terminates with a dump of the page on which the OBID does not find a match in the
source list.
User response: Resubmit the job with correct input OBID values.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSN1988I csect-name EXPAND KEYWORD IS SPECIFIED BUT DICTIONARY IS NOT FOUND

Severity: 4 (warning)
DSN1991I UNCLUSTERED DATA DETECTED. RID: record-ID TABLE: table-name INDEX KEY: key-name
Explanation: The arrangement of data in one of the following DB2 catalog table spaces is not optimal for
minimizing locking contention:
v SYSDBASE
v SYSPLAN
v SYSVIEWS
Data is not broken. Only the arrangement is affected.
record-ID
The record ID in the format 'xxxxxxxx'X for the duplicate record found.
table-name
The name of the table for which data is unclustered.
key-name
The index key that identifies the row that is unclustered.
Normally, data on these pages is arranged to minimize locking contention. DSN1COPY found that the arrangement
of data no longer minimizes locking contention for the specified objects. Therefore, an increase in the number of
deadlocks and timeouts may be seen on SYSDBASE, SYSPLAN, and SYSVIEWS.
System action: Processing continues.
Administrator response: Run the REORG TABLESPACE utility on the relevant catalog table space to rearrange the
data.
DSN1992I VSAM PUT ERROR, RPLERREG = return-code, RPLERRCD = reason-code

for Data Sets for more information on the standard VSAM procedures, the RPL fields, and the VSAM control blocks.
User response: Notify system programmer.
Severity: 8 (error)
DSN1996I VSAM OPEN ERROR, ACBERRFLG = ACB error-code. OPEN option
Explanation: VSAM OPEN failed with the indicated 'ACB error-code'. The OPEN option was either 'INPUT' or
'OUTPUT'.
System action: Processing terminates if error code is greater than or equal to 128; otherwise, processing continues
normally.
System programmer response: Follow standard VSAM diagnostic procedure. See z/OS DFSMS: Macro Instructions for
Data Sets for more information on the standard VSAM procedures and the VSAM control blocks.
User response: Notify system programmer.
Severity: 8 (error) if error is greater than or equal to 128; otherwise, severity code is 4.
DSN1997I OUTPUT DSNAME = data-set-name, data-set-type

System action: The stand-alone utility starts processing.
Severity: 0 (informational).
DSN3001I csect-name ABNORMAL DISCONNECT FROM SUBSYSTEM INTERFACE
Explanation: This message indicates that 'csect-name' detected that an online routine was still supporting SSI calls
(IEFSSREQ) even though DB2 was nearly done terminating or no longer executing. This occurs with 'csect-name'
DSN3RS0Xwhen the service address space has reached end-of-memory and neither normal termination nor online
error recovery routines have successfully completed termination of the DB2 subsystem. This occurs with 'csect-name'
DSN3SSTM when this condition is discovered during online termination.
System action: The connection is terminated. All IEFSSREQ requests are handled by the DB2 ERLY code until DB2
is restarted.
Problem determination: An SVC dump is requested. This SVC dump and associated SYS1.LOGREC entries provide
information to determine which resource managers had not removed their support of particular SSI function codes.
For dumps requested by DSN3RS0X,all pertinent control blocks and stack storage are dumped. The primary control
block of interest is the SSVT for DB2.
For DSN3SSTM, the DB2 'standard dump' facility is used to dump the information necessary for problem diagnosis.
The primary control blocks of interest are the 'active' CONN blocks.
DSN3002I RECOVERY INCOMPLETE FOR connection-name
Explanation: At least one DB2 unit of recovery (UR), related to an identified subsystem ('connection-name'), is still
'indoubt' after restart synchronization has taken place. ('Indoubt' URs are those for which commit has been voted by
DB2 but which have not been acknowledged by 'connection-name'.)
This message may appear if the 'connection-name' subsystem has begun to do new work before having resolved all
indoubt URs. The 'connection-name' subsystem may be in the process of resolving the indoubt URs.
System action: Resources held (locked) by these 'indoubt' URs are unavailable to any other work units until their
status is resolved.
System programmer response: The system programmer and/or system administrator must determine the correct
recovery action to resolve the 'indoubt' situations. This involves either 'ensure-commit' or 'backout' decisions for all
'indoubt' URs.
The -DISPLAY THREAD command should be used to see the URs still indoubt. It may show that all indoubt URs
have already been resolved. The -RECOVER INDOUBT command should be used, either from an MVS console or
through an attachment facility, to resolve the indoubt URs and to release the resources they hold.
Problem determination: This error is probably caused by a cold start after an abnormal termination of either
subsystem or by offline alterations of the logs of either subsystem.
DSN3004I DESCRIPTOR GET FAILURE RC=X xxxxxxxx, REASON=X xxxxxxxx
Explanation: The parameter list required to create the DB2 agents under which IEFSSREQ calls are processed could
not be obtained from the subsystem support subcomponent directory of internal parameters (DSN3DIR1). The RC
indicates the return code received from the system parameter manager and REASON indicates the reason code (from
register 0).
The return code is always 4 when this message is presented, indicating that the IEFSSREQ descriptor was not found
in the subsystem support subcomponent directory. This is a system error and results in termination of the DB2
subsystem. The reason code is always 0.
System action: Subsystem initialization is discontinued. Termination occurs.
System programmer response: Repair the master directory (DSNZPARM) and/or the DB2 program libraries, and
restart the DB2 subsystem.
Problem determination: If the problem persists, use any dumps and the console log to diagnose the problem. If you
suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the
problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
DSN3006I xxxx SSI FUNCTION WAS ALREADY ACTIVE WHEN ACTIVATE WAS ATTEMPTED
Explanation: An initialization sequence error has occurred. The subsystem support for SSI services resource
manager (SSSS) has discovered during its initialization that another resource manager ('xxxx') has already activated
the EOM or FEOT SSI call by calling DSN3AC0X. If this occurs, the error is a serious one.
System action: Subsystem initialization is discontinued. DB2 termination occurs.
System programmer response: Ensure that all maintenance has been applied to the DB2 program libraries, and then
restart the DB2 subsystem.
Problem determination: If the problem persists, use any dumps and the console log to diagnose the problem. If you
suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the
problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
DSN3007I xxxx SSI FUNCTION WAS ALREADY INACTIVE WHEN DEACTIVATE WAS ATTEMPTED
Explanation: A termination sequence error has occurred. The subsystem support for SSI services resource manager
(SSSS) has discovered during its termination that another resource manager ('xxxx') has already deactivated the EOM
or FEOT SSI call by calling DSN3AC0X. If this occurs, the error is a serious one.
System action: Termination continues.
System programmer response: Ensure that all maintenance has been applied to the DB2 program libraries.
Problem determination: If the problem persists, use any dumps and the console log to diagnose the problem. If you
suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the
problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
DSN3008I csect-name ABNORMAL DISCONNECT FOR PROGRAM REQUEST HANDLER(S)
Explanation: This message indicates that 'csect-name' has discovered that one or more resource managers are still
supporting application program calls through their program request handler, even though DB2 was almost done
terminating or was no longer executing. This occurs when the system services address space has gone to end of
memory and neither normal termination nor online error recovery routines have successfully completed termination
of the DB2 subsystem.
System action: The program request handler (PRH) connection is terminated. All application program support
requests are rejected with an indication that DB2 is not up.
System programmer response: See the Problem Determination section of this message.
Problem determination: An SVC dump is requested. This SVC dump and associated SYS1.LOGREC entries provide
information to determine which resource managers were still supporting application program support calls. All
pertinent control blocks and stack storage are dumped. The primary control block of interest is the program request
handler block (PRHB).
DSN3010I csect-name PARTICIPANT RRS IS COLD STARTING AND HAS LOST ITS LOG. OTHER RECOVERABLE RESOURCE MANAGERS MIGHT HAVE INDOUBT UNITS OF RECOVERY.
Explanation: DB2 has coordinator responsibility for indoubt units of recovery and RRS has a participant role in the
unit of recovery. RRS has cold started and has lost knowledge of indoubt units of recovery. There might be damage
at RRS Recoverable Resource Managers that also participated in the unit of recovery.
System action: Processing continues.
System programmer response: Contact the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: DB2 is the coordinator for one or more indoubt units of recovery at other RRS
recoverable resource managers. RRS has lost all knowledge of these units of recovery. The participant RRS
Recoverable Resource Managers might still have indoubt units of recovery. DB2 has no knowledge of other RRS
Recoverable Resource Manager except for the RRS unit of recover ID (URID) that identifies such a unit of recovery.
Subsequent DSN3017I, DSN3018I or DSN3019I messages describe the status of each unit of recovery and contain the
RRS URID for each.
DSN3011I csect-name COORDINATOR RRS IS COLD STARTING AND HAS LOST ITS LOG. INDOUBT DB2 THREADS NEED MANUAL RESOLUTION.
Explanation: DB2 has participant responsibility for indoubt threads. RRS, the commit coordinator, has informed DB2
that it lost all knowledge of DB2 indoubt threads. The indoubt threads at this DB2 must be manually resolved with
the RECOVER INDOUBT command.
System action: Processing continues.
System programmer response: Contact the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: DB2 is a participant with one or more indoubt threads. The coordinator is RRS. RRS
has lost knowledge of the indoubt DB2 threads. A list of indoubt threads where RRS is the coordinator can be
displayed using the DISPLAY THREAD command for indoubt type threads by specifying RRSAF as the connection
name. A DSNV408I message with coordinator = RRSAF identifies a thread of this type. The DSNV449I message in
the DISPLAY THREAD report that follows contains the RRS unit of recovery ID (URID) that identifies the RRS unit
of recovery in the NID field.
The heuristic decision (that is, to commit or abort the logical unit of work) should be coordinated with any other
participant RRS Recoverable Resource Managers. The existence of other participants might not be easy to determine.
The information might be available in the MVS/RRS recovery log even though information has been lost.
At this DB2, all indoubt threads coordinated by the RRS must be resolved with the RECOVER INDOUBT command.
Locked data remains unavailable until resolution. Threads that were already resolved with this command are
discarded. Threads not yet resolved are discarded after resolution with the command.
The commit or abort decision provided using the RECOVER INDOUBT command for a logical unit of work are
propagated to all downstream participants, if any.
DSN3012I csect-name DB2 WAS RESTARTED ON THE WRONG SYSTEM AND CANNOT CONNECT TO RRS. THERE ARE UNRESOLVED UNITS OF RECOVERY WHERE DB2 IS THE COORDINATOR.
Explanation: DB2 is the commit coordinator for one or more indoubt units of recovery. DB2 is unable to connect to
RRS to resolve these indoubt units of recovery.
System action: Processing continues.
Operator response: Use the RRS IPCS interface to determine the correct system and restart DB2 on that system.
DSN3013I csect-name DB2 WAS RESTARTED ON THE WRONG SYSTEM AND CANNOT CONNECT TO RRS. THERE ARE UNRESOLVED UNITS OF RECOVERY WHERE DB2 IS A PARTICIPANT.
Explanation: DB2 has one or more indoubt threads and is unable to connect to RRS to resolve these indoubt units of
recovery.
System action: Processing continues.
Operator response: Use the RRS IPCS interface to determine the correct system and restart DB2 on that system.
DSN3014I csect-name DB2 HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF RRS URID=rrs_urid. THE RRS UR IS INDOUBT. THE DB2 URID RECORDED BY RRS=db2_urid.
Explanation: DB2 is restarting with RRS where DB2 is a participant and RRS is the coordinator. RRS has a unit of
recovery that DB2 should be a participant in, but DB2 has no knowledge of the RRS unit of recovery. The RRS unit of
recovery ID is 'rrs_urid'. RRS has recorded the DB2 unit of recovery ID as 'db2_urid'.
System action: Restart with RRS continues.
Operator response: Notify the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: This message might indicate a DB2 or RRS problem, or it might be produced
normally because one of the following prior actions:
v A DB2 conditional restart was performed that resulted in the loss of part or all of the DB2 log. This conditional
restart might have happened at any time in the past.
v The DB2 RECOVER INDOUBT command was used to resolve the DB2 unit of recovery with URID 'db2_urid'.
If either of these occurred, the message can be ignored. If neither occurred, there might be a DB2 or an RRS problem.
If the 'db2_urid' appears to be a valid log RBA, use the DSN1LOGP utility with the SUMMARY option and URID
options using the 'db2-urid' value. If DSN1LOGP finds the 'db2-urid', the disposition will indicate whether the DB2
UR was committed or aborted (rolled back). If possible, use the RRS ISPF interface to commit or abort the RRS URID
to avoid heuristic damage.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of DB2 log output.
v DB2 log output, including any DB2 recovery log archive tapes.
v Copy of the log for this period, so that additional DSN1LOGP reports can be produced for problem determination.

DSN3015I csect-name DB2 HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF RRS URID=rrs_urid. THE RRS UR IS INDOUBT. THE DB2 URID RECORDED BY RRS=db2_urid.
Explanation: DB2 is restarting with RRS where DB2 is the coordinator and RRS is the participant. RRS has a unit of
recovery that DB2 should be the coordinator of, but DB2 has no knowledge of the RRS unit of recovery. The RRS unit
of recovery ID is 'rrs_urid'. RRS has recorded the DB2 unit of recovery ID as 'db2_urid'.
System action: Restart with RRS continues.
Operator response: Notify the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: This message might indicate a DB2 or RRS problem, or it might be produced
normally because a DB2 conditional restart was performed that resulted in the loss of part or all of the DB2 log. This
conditional restart might have happened at any time in the past.
If the 'db2_urid' appears to be a valid log RBA, use the DSN1LOGP utility with the SUMMARY option and URID
options using the 'db2-urid' value. If DSN1LOGP finds the 'db2-urid', the disposition will indicate whether the DB2
UR was committed or aborted (rolled back). Use the RRS ISPF interface to commit or abort the RRS URID to avoid
heuristic damage.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of DB2 log output.
v DB2 log output, including any DB2 recovery log archive tapes.
v Copy of the log for this period, so that additional DSN1LOGP reports can be produced for problem determination.

DSN3016I csect-name RRS HAS LOST DATA FROM ITS LOG.
Explanation: DB2 is restarting with RRS and RRS has lost some portion of its log.
System action: Restart with RRS continues.
Operator response: Notify the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: DB2 might not be able to resolve indoubt Units of Recovery successfully with RRS
because of the loss of RRS log data. This message might be followed by one or more of the following messages:
DSN3017I, DSN3018I, DSN3019I, DSN3020I, DSN3021I, DSN3022I and DSN3023I.  DSN3017I csect-name RRS HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF DB2 URID=db2_urid. THE DB2 UR IS INDOUBT. THE RRS URID RECORDED BY DB2=rrs_urid.
Explanation: DB2 is restarting with RRS where DB2 is the coordinator and RRS is a participant. DB2 has a unit of
recovery that RRS should be a participant in, but RRS has no knowledge of the DB2 unit of recovery. The DB2 unit of
recovery ID is 'db2_urid'. DB2 has recorded the RRS unit of recovery ID as 'rrs_urid'.
System action: Restart with RRS continues.
Operator response: Notify the database administrator.
Database Administrator Action: This message might indicate a DB2 or RRS problem, or it might be produced
normally because of one of the following:

DSN3100I src csect-name - SUBSYSTEM ssnm READY FOR START COMMAND
Explanation: This message indicates that a DB2 subsystem is ready to be started.
src The DB2 command prefix.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
ssnm The DB2 subsystem name.
This message occurs during MVS IPL processing. Message DSN3104I is also issued during this processing.
If AUTOSTART=YES is specified in DSNZPARM and this message is used as a trigger for automation to restart the
DB2, a DELAY must be programmed into the automation to allow time for the IRLM to process the termination, and
issue the STOP IRLM. Another approach would be to monitor for both the DB2 termination and the IRLM
termination in combination, before restarting DB2. If neither of these actions are done, DB2 could identify to the
existing IRLM and will NOT STOP automatically from that point onward.
Operator response: Issue the -START command when you are ready to start DB2.
DSN3101I csect-name INVALID EARLY PROCESSING MODULE NAME IN PARMLIB RECORD. ssnm IS NOT AVAILABLE

DSN3108I csect-name COMMAND REJECTED. COMMAND FACILITY PATH UNAVAILABLE
Explanation: CSECT DSN3EC0X has discovered that the path from MVS consoles to the DB2 command processor is
unavailable. It may still be possible to enter commands through one of the attachment facilities.
System action: The command is not processed. This message is delivered to the console that entered the command.
System programmer response: The console command facility is available again the next time DB2 is started. If it is
necessary to regain this facility immediately, DB2 should be canceled and restarted.
DSN3109I csect-name - UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUBSYSTEM AFFINITY TABLE INDEX FOR SUBSYSTEM ssnm.  IEFSSREQ RC = nn
Explanation: CSECT DSN3UR00 was unable to obtain a subsystem affinity table index for the named subsystem.
MVS did not recognize the named subsystem name as a known subsystem. If this message is issued, a serious error
has occurred in MVS or DB2.
In the message, 'nn' is the return code from the IEFSSREQ MVS service. 'ssnm' is the name of the DB2 subsystem
undergoing IPL-time initialization.
System action: DSN3UR00 abends with completion code X'04E' and reason code X'00F30104'. The DB2 subsystem
with the indicated name is not available for this IPL of MVS.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Try to re-IPL. If the problem persists, follow standard DB2 problem reporting
procedures.
Problem determination: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC. No SVC dump is taken. Return codes from
IEFSSREQ are documented under control block SSOB in the appropriate MVS publication.
DSN3111I csect-name LOAD MODULE module-name DOES NOT HAVE AMODE(31) ATTRIBUTE. ssnm IS NOT AVAILABLE
Explanation: The DB2 program which establishes DB2 as an MVS subsystem during Master Scheduler initialization
has determined that either its own load module or a load module loaded by it does not have the linkage editor
attributes AMODE(31) and RMODE(ANY). Most DB2 load modules must be capable of running in the 31-bit
addressing mode.
In the message, 'csect-name' is the name of the program detecting the error, 'module-name' is the name of the first
load module found with an invalid AMODE attribute, and 'ssnm' is the name of the DB2 subsystem undergoing
IPL-time initialization.
System action: Program DSN3UR00 abends with a code of X'04E' and a reason code of X'00F30111'. The DB2
subsystem named 'ssnm' is not initialized. The subsystem will not be available until the error is corrected and MVS is
re-IPLed.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer of the failure.
System programmer response: Verify that all of the following were done:
v The installation and maintenance activities against DB2 were executed using SMP.
v The JCLIN for SMP included the correct AMODE and RMODE control statements.
v The appropriate Linkage Editor provided with the Data Facility Product (DFP) for the version of MVS being used
was invoked by SMP for the link-edit steps.
Correct and rerun the procedure or JCL which caused the error. If necessary, REJECT all SMP APPLY steps which
were executed incorrectly and rerun the rejected steps. Request a re-IPL of MVS.
Problem determination: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC. No SVC dump is taken.
The MVS service aid AMBLIST provides Linkage Editor module attributes in the summary section of the LISTLOAD
function output.
DSN3112I csect-name UNABLE TO REGISTER COMMAND PREFIX, CPF RETURN CODE = xxyy. ssnm IS NOT AVAILABLE
Explanation: DB2 is unable to register the installation-specified command prefix with MVS. The command prefix is
specified in the subsystem definition parameter in SYS1.PARMLIB(IEFSSNnn). xx is the hexadecimal return code, and
yy is the hexadecimal reason code from the command prefix facility (CPF) of MVS.
System action: The DB2 subsystem, ssnm, is not available.
System programmer response: Use the information listed for REQUEST=DEFINE in CPF macro return and reason
codes (MVS Programming Assembler Services Reference) to identify the cause of the error and determine what to do.
Find the specific combination of return code (xx) and reason code (yy) that identifies the meaning of the error and the
suggested action.
Ensure that the specified command prefix is not already registered, or is not a substring or superstring of an already
registered command prefix. Use the MVS DISPLAY OPDATA command, if necessary, to see command prefixes
registered with MVS.

DSN3113I csect-name INVALID SUBSYSTEM DEFINITION PARAMETER IN PARMLIB RECORD. ssnm IS NOT AVAILABLE.
Explanation: DB2 detected an error in the subsystem definition parameter, which is obtained from the IEFSSNxx
member of SYS1.PARMLIB. Some possible causes for this error are:
v The early processing load module name is not between 1 and 8 characters long.
v The command prefix is not between 1 and 8 characters long.
v The command prefix scope is not 1 character long.
v The command prefix scope is not X, S, or M.
v The group attach name is not between 1 and 4 characters long.
The command prefix is not inserted into this message because it is unknown. The name of the subsystem attempting
to initialize is ssnm.
System action: The DB2 subsystem is not available.
System programmer response: Correct the subsystem definition parameter and re-IPL MVS.

DSN3114I csect-name GROUP ATTACH NAME IS NOT ALLOWED WITH THIS RELEASE OF MVS. ssnm IS NOT AVAILABLE
Explanation: DB2 found an installation-specified group attachment name specified in the subsystem definition
parameter, IEFSSNxx, but DB2 group attachment is not supported with this release of MVS. DB2's group attachment
feature requires MVS/ESA SP4.2.2 or a later release. The DB2 subsystem ssnm is not available.
System programmer response: Delete the group attachment name in the subsystem definition parameter and re-IPL.
DSN3115I csect-name UNABLE TO REGISTER GROUP ATTACH NAME, NAME/TOKEN RC = xx. ssnm IS NOT AVAILABLE
Explanation: DB2 is unable to register the installation-specified group attach name with MVS. The group attach
name is specified in the subsystem definition parameter. xx is the hexadecimal return code from the MVS
Name/Token service. Subsystem ssnm is not available.
System action: This DB2 subsystem is not available.

DSN3201I ABNORMAL EOT IN PROGRESS FOR USER=xxxxxxxx CONNECTION-ID=yyyyyyyy CORRELATION-ID=zzzzzzzzzzzz JOBNAME=aaaaaaaa ASID=9999 TCB=99999999
Explanation: Abnormal termination started for the agent with the values shown for USER, CONNECTION-ID,
CORRELATION-ID, JOBNAME, ASID and TCB address. These values are the last known set of identifiers for the
terminating agent.
The abnormal termination could be the result of a failure in the allied agent's address space or the result of an
operator cancel command.
The value for the USER and/or CORRELATION-ID might be blank. If the terminating agent is connected to DB2 at
the IDENTIFY level and was not previously signed on, or was not previously authorized to a plan at the time of the
failure, then no CORRELATION-ID is associated with the agent. Otherwise, the values for the USER,
CONNECTION-ID, CORRELATION-ID, JOBNAME and ASID are the last values established to DB2 for this
connection. They might represent the current activity of the agent. The TCB value is the address of the TCB that is
terminating. Previous DB2 work by this agent might have completed successfully. Correlation IDs beginning with
'0nn', where nn is a number from 01 to 28, identify system agents.
System action: The agent was previously queued to a System Services service task for termination processing. This
message indicates that the agent was taken from the queue for processing. Any uncommitted database changes are
rolled back.
System programmer response: See the Problem Determination section for this message. The MVS CANCEL and
FORCE commands have no effect and should not be issued. DB2 should not be canceled. If an extensive rollback is
in progress, the subsequent DB2 restart might take a very long time because of additional log activity.
User response: Your job or TSO session cannot be canceled. The PA1 key has no effect in this circumstance. To avoid
long waits when your application program is canceled or terminates abnormally, issue frequent commits.
Problem determination: You can detect a deferred termination condition for a task by examining several indicators.
Some or all of the following might be present:
v The allied address space might be swapped out and appear to be in a never-ending WAIT condition.
v The MVS commands CANCEL and FORCE appear to have no effect.
v The allied task holds an MVS-shared ENQ on resource SYSZDSN3.ERLYOLRHerly-block-address.
v During abnormal termination of the agent associated with the failing task, but before this message was written, the
task's connection appears on the -DISPLAY THREAD output with a QD status. See message DSNV401I for the
definition of this status code.
v This message, DSN3201I, is written to the MVS console after the agent is removed from the service task work
queue when termination processing begins.
v During abnormal termination of the agent associated with the failing task, the task's connection appears on the
-DISPLAY THREAD output with a D status. See message DSNV401I for the definition of this status code.
DSN3458I csect-name MODULE modname MUST HAVE THE AMODE (31) ATTRIBUTE
Explanation: An authorization exit load module was not link-edited with the 31-bit addressing mode (AMODE)
attribute. Either load module DSN3@ATH or DSN3@SGN is specified by 'modname'.
System action: Subsystem startup is terminated.
System programmer response: Relink-edit the authorization exit module specifying the attributes AMODE(31),
RMODE(ANY).
Problem determination: Check the load module attributes used for the link-edit.
DSN3580I CONNECTION FOR [EOM | FEOT | IDEN] GAVE RC=X xxxxxxxx, REASON=X xxxxxxxx
Explanation: A nonzero return code has been returned to DSN3AMI2 from the SSSS connect to subsystem interface
call. The variables in the message indicate which SSI call is involved and the actual return and reason codes
associated with it.
System action: The current task (TCB) is abended with a system completion code of X'04E' and with an abend
reason code of '00F30580' The DB2 subsystem terminates.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Restart the DB2 subsystem.
Problem determination: The trace table and stack storage associated with the EB in register 6 must be examined to
locate the error.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
DSN3581I csect-name SAF service FAILED WITH SAF RETURN CODE = saf-retc, RACF RETURN CODE = racf-retc, AND RACF REASON CODE = racf-reac. DB2 REASON CODE = db2-reac
Explanation: DB2 invoked the specified SAF (Security Authorization Facility) service which failed with the
following codes:
Variable
Definition
csect The CSECT name of the DB2 module that issued the message.
service The name of the service that failed.
saf-retc The SAF return code.
racf-retc
The RACF return code.
db2-retc
The DB2-assigned reason code for the failure.
DB2 associates the failure with a DB2 reason code which may appear in other messages associated with this
failure.
System action: The call fails. Other messages associated with this feature may follow.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: The action to take depends on the service being used.
v R_ticketserv
DB2 requests this service to parse a Kerberos ticket received from a remote client. Refer to OS/390 Security Server
(RACF) Callable services for an explanation of the error.
DB2 uses the SAF R_ticketserv service to parse a Kerberos ticket that was received from a remote client. Refer to
OS/390 SecureWay Security Server RACF Callable Services for an explanation of the error. A SAF and RACF return
code of 8 and 16 indicate a failure from the Network Authentication Privacy Service (Kerberos) when parsing the
ticket in which case the RACF reason code contains a status code from the Network Authentication Privacy
Service. These status codes are documented in the OS/390 SecureWaySecurity Server Network Authentication and
Privacy Service Administration manual. Additional information for some of the more common status codes and how
they relate to DB2 follows:
96C73A07
One possibility is that you must associate the ssnmDIST started task user ID with a principal name and
the client system must use this principal name in the Kerberos target principal.
Note: DB2 Connect? client systems must catalog a DB2 for OS/390 database with "AUTHENTICATION
KERBEROS TARGET PRINCIPAL principal_name". Assume that SYSDSP is the user ID associated with
the ssnmDIST started task. A principal, say SYSDSPp, must be associated to the SYSDSP user ID by a
RACF ALTUSER command. Further, the SYSDSPp principal name must appear in the target principal
name of the DB2 Connect database configuration for the DB2 for OS/390 database.
v R_ticketserv(principal name)
DB2 uses the SAF R_usermap service to determine the user ID associated with a Kerberos ticket received from a
remote client. Refer to OS/390 SecureWay Security Server RACF Callable Services for an explanation of the error. The
principal name obtained from the ticket is included in parenthesis to assist the user in determining the cause of the
problem. Either the client system is using an invalid principal name, or a principal name to user ID association has
not been defined to RACF.
Principals authenticated on the local OS/390 realm must have a mapping that associates the local principal name
to a local RACF user ID. This association can be made by using the RACF ADDUSER or ALTUSER commands
with the KERBNAME parameter.
Principals authenticated on a foreign realm must have a mapping that associates the foreign fully qualified
principal name to a local RACF user ID. This association can be made by using the RACF RDEFINE or RALTER
commands with the KERBLINK parameter.
v R_usermap
DB2 requests this service to determine the user ID associated with a Kerberos ticket received from a remote client.
Refer to OS/390 Security Server (RACF) Callable services for an explanation of the error.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
DSN5001I ERROR OCCURRED WHILE CONTACTING OMNIFIND SERVER server FOR function. ON COLLECTION collection.
Explanation: A failure that requires action from the system administrator occurred while contacting an OmniFind?
server.
System action: If the function is SYSPROC.SYSTS_DROP, the information in DB2 for the collection is deleted. If the
function is SYSPROC.SYSTS_UPDATE, takeover of the collection by another IBM OmniFind server of
SYSIBMTS.SYSTEXTSERVERS is attempted.
Programmer response: If the function is SYSPROC.SYSTS_DROP, then collection must be deleted at the OF server
using OF administration APIs. If the function is SEARCH (Contains or Score), check if the IBM OmniFind server has
a persistent problem and call SYSPROC.SYSTS_TAKEOVER. If the function is SYSPROC.SYSTS_TAKEOVER, then
takeover was not possible or failed; therefore check the IBM OmniFind server. If takeover was not possible because
no additional servers are registered in SYSIBMTS. SYSTEXTSERVERS (message parameter server empty), add an
additional server and check and correct the problem on the existing server or servers.
DSN7000I csect-name REQUIRED CSECT DSN6GRP COULD NOT BE FOUND IN SYSTEM PARAMETERS LOAD MODULE.
Explanation: The required CSECT DSN6GRP was not found in the system parameters load module.
System action: The DB2 subsystem terminates with reason code 00F70001.
Operator response: Restart DB2 with the correct system parameters load module.
System programmer response: Reassemble the system parameters load module and include the DSN6GRP macro.
DSN7003I csect-name SCA DELETED BECAUSE OF SUBSYSTEM PARAMETER SETTING

DSN7505A csect-name THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF FREE STORAGE IN SCA STRUCTURE sca-structure-name
Explanation: The amount of free storage in the shared communications area (SCA) coupling facility structure is low.
The SCA is 75 percent full. Because SCA storage space is required by some DB2 commands and processes, the
availability of those processes might be affected. Completely running out of SCA storage can cause DB2 subsystem
outages.
System action: DB2 processing continues.
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
This message might not be automatically deleted in a pre SP5.2.1-JES3 environment.
Operator response: If the message remains highlighted after the error situation is cleared up, manually delete the
message from the console.
System programmer response: You can monitor the amount of SCA storage in use with the DISPLAY GROUP
command.
You can free SCA storage by removing exception conditions. Another thing you can do is issue START DATABASE
commands with the SPACENAM option or use the RECOVER utility to remove pages from the logical page list
(LPL).
If you don't do anything to reclaim space, message DSN7512A appears when the SCA is 90 percent full.

DSN7507I csect-name SCA STRUCTURE sca-structure-name IS ALLOCATED IN A VOLATILE STRUCTURE.
Explanation: The shared communications area (SCA) structure is volatile.
System action: DB2 processing continues.
System programmer response: One DB2 issues this message whenever the structure has the volatile attribute. DB2
detects this either on the first connection to the SCA or on the attribute changes later. DB2 always requests a
nonvolatile SCA. If this is not what you want, change the MVS CFRM administrative policy and request a rebuild of
the SCA with the MVS SETXCF START,REBUILD command.
DSN7508I csect-name ACCESS TO THE SCA STRUCTURE sca-structure-name FAILED. MVS IXLLIST RETURN CODE = xxxxxxxx, MVS IXLLIST REASON CODE = yyyyyyyy.

Explanation: The DB2 subsystem received a request from MVS to rebuild the shared communications area (SCA),
but DB2 is not ready to participate in this process because DB2 startup has not yet completed.
System action: DB2 terminates with reason code 00F70604. The SCA rebuild process might continue for other DB2s
in the data sharing group.
Operator response: Wait until the SCA rebuild process is finished and then start the failed DB2 again.
DSN7511I csect-name RESPONSE TO MVS REBUILD COMPLETE OF SCA STRUCTURE sca-structure-name FAILED. MVS IXLREBLD RETURN CODE = xxxxxxxx, MVS IXLREBLD REASON CODE = yyyyyyyy.
Explanation: DB2 encountered an error during the rebuild of the shared communications area (SCA) structure.
System action: DB2 stops.
System programmer response: DB2 uses the MVS IXLREBLD service during the SCA structure rebuild. Refer to
MVS/ESA Programming: Sysplex Services Reference for return and reason codes from the IXLREBLD request.
DSN7512A csect-name THERE IS A CRITICAL SHORTAGE OF FREE STORAGE IN SCA STRUCTURE sca-structure-name
Explanation: The amount of free storage in the shared communications area (SCA) coupling facility structure is
critically low. The SCA is 90 percent full.
System action: DB2 processing continues. However, DB2 limits use of SCA to critical information. Some utilities or
commands that cannot be completed can cause one or more members of the group to come down.
This message is non-scrollable. It remains highlighted on the console until you take the appropriate action.
This message might not be automatically deleted in a pre SP5.2.1-JES3 environment.
System programmer response: You can monitor the amount of SCA storage in use with the DISPLAY GROUP
command.
You can free SCA storage by removing exception conditions. Another thing you can do is issue START DATABASE
commands with the SPACENAM option or use the RECOVER utility to remove pages from the logical page list
(LPL). Then restart any failed DB2s.
If your actions do not free up enough space, or if the problem continues to occur, you have the following options,
depending on what level of MVS and the coupling facility control code you are running with:
v If all members of the group are running with MVS Version 5 Release 2 and with a coupling facility control code
level greater than 0, issue the SETXCF START,ALTER command to increase the size of the SCA. The size you
specify must be less than or equal to the maximum size defined the CFRM policy for the SCA structure.
If the maximum size (SIZE in the CFRM policy) is still not big enough, take the actions described below for MVS
Version 5 Release 1 systems.
v If any or all members of the group are running with MVS Version 5 Release 1 or with a coupling facility control
code level of 0, increase the storage for the SCA in the CFRM policy. Then issue the MVS SETXCF
START,REBUILD command to rebuild the structure.

Explanation: DB2 was waiting to join the XCF group, but XCF has not completed cleanup for this member's last
instance. Cleanup must be completed before DB2 restart processing can proceed.
member-name
The name of the DB2 member that is attempting to join the XCF group.
System action: DB2 will continue to try to join the XCF group periodically for up to five minutes. If DB2 is unable
to join the group within five minutes, message DSN7403I is issued and restart processing terminates.
Operator response: No immediate action is required. Wait for DB2 restart to succeed or fail. If restart processing
fails repeatedly, determine the status of XCF during the time that DB2 is waiting to join the XCF group. This
information is used in problem determination for message DSN7403I.
Problem determination: While DB2 is waiting for XCF cleanup to complete, issue the following z/OS command,
substituting the name of the data sharing group for group-name:
DISPLAY XCF, GROUP, group-name, ALL

DSN9008I KEYWORD keyword-name MAY NOT BE NEGATED
Explanation: The negation characters (NO) appear in front of the keyword (specified in the message as
keyword-name), but negating this keyword is not allowed. As an example, consider a keyword called PRINT that
could indicate that you want something printed. If you did not want the material to be printed, you might specify
NOPRINT. This process of prefixing a keyword with the characters NO is called negation. While negation may be
meaningful on some keywords, it is not allowed on all keywords.
System action: Processing for the command is terminated.
System programmer response: Reenter the command, but do not negate the named keyword.
Problem determination: Obtain a copy of the system or terminal log to verify the command entry.

System action: Processing for the command is terminated.
System programmer response: Enter the command again, and include the specified keyword.
Problem determination: Obtain a copy of the system or terminal log to verify the command entry.
DSN9010I REQUIRED PARAMETER FOR KEYWORD keyword-name IS MISSING
Explanation: A parameter must be specified for the keyword specified in the message (as 'keyword-name'), but no
parameter was entered.
As an example of this error, consider a keyword called PRIORITY whose value can range from 0 to 9. Specification of
PRIORITY(1) is acceptable, but, if you specify PRIORITY with no parameter value, the keyword is meaningless.
System action: Processing for the command is terminated.
System programmer response: Supply appropriate parameters for the specified keyword and reissue the command.

Explanation: Parameter values for the keyword specified in the message (as 'keyword-name') must be hexadecimal
values. The value must be specified as X'hex characters'. Hexadecimal characters are defined as the numeric digits 0
through 9 and the letters A through F. Either uppercase or lowercase is acceptable for the letters A through F.
As an example of this error, consider the keyword OFFSET, for which you are expected to enter a hexadecimal value.
If you enter OFFSET(X'2C'), it is acceptable. However, entering OFFSET(Jones) is not acceptable.
System action: Processing for the command is terminated.
System programmer response: Reissue the command, but ensure that the parameters for the named keyword are
hexadecimal values.
Problem determination: Obtain a copy of the system or terminal log to verify the command entry.
DSN9013I KEYWORD keyword-name PARAMETER parameter value EXCEEDS ALLOWABLE LENGTH OF nn
Explanation: The parameter value (specified in the message as parameter value) exceeds the limit of nn characters in
length.
As an example of this type of error, consider a PRIORITY keyword whose value may range from zero to nine. If you
specify PRIORITY(21) or PRIORITY(006), the value you have entered exceeds the limit of one character.
System action: Processing for the command is terminated.
System programmer response: Correct the error, and reissue the command.
Problem determination: Obtain a copy of the system or terminal log to verify the command entry.
Related reference:
The DSN command and its subcommands (DB2 Commands)
Related information:
DB2 and related commands (DB2 Commands)
DSN9014I KEYWORD keyword-name LIMIT OF nn PARAMETER(S) EXCEEDED
Explanation: Too many parameters have been specified for the keyword that is specified in the message. The
command processor does not accept more than the limit of parameters, which is specified by the value of nn. This
error is probably caused by entering too many parameters. It could also be caused by a missing close parenthesis that
has not yet been detected.
System action: Processing for the command is terminated.
System programmer response: Reissue the command, and enter no more than the specified limit of parameters for
the given keyword. If necessary, issue the command more than once to process all the parameter values.

DSN9015I PARAMETER parameter-value IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR KEYWORD keyword-name
Explanation: The parameter value specified in the message is not an acceptable value for the named keyword.
As an example, consider a keyword called PRINT that can have parameters of YES or NO. Specification of
PRINT(YES) or PRINT(NO) is valid. However, specification of PRINT(MAYBE) is unacceptable.
System action: Processing for the command is terminated.
System programmer response: Correct and reissue the command.
Problem determination: Obtain a copy of the system or terminal log to verify the command entry.

Explanation: The command processor was unable to obtain sufficient storage to complete processing of any
response messages generated by the invoked command.
System action: Processing for the command is terminated abnormally.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer before attempting to reissue the command.
System programmer response: Determine the reason for insufficient storage available to the command. If a cursory
examination of the system indicates that the region sizes for DB2 are sufficient, and the current workload does not
seem excessive, an MVS Console dump (MVS DUMP command) might be required.
Ensure that any retry steps defined by the command are performed prior to reissuing the command.
Problem determination: The invoked command had completed processing and returned to the command
preprocessor when an attempt was made to obtain storage from the address space from which the command was
entered. Because sufficient storage was unavailable, no response messages from the invoked command are available.
DSN9019I VERB verb-name IS NOT A KNOWN COMMAND

Explanation: The text that follows the named keyword contains invalid syntax.
As an example, consider specification of CLASS==A. The double equal signs do not conform to the rules of syntax
and make the keyword meaningless. This is just one example of invalid syntax. It is not practical to try to illustrate
every possible error here. You could, however, correctly specify CLASS=A or CLASS(A).
System action: Processing for the command is terminated.
System programmer response: Examine the text following the named keyword to ensure that no errors were made
as the command was entered. Ensure that you have followed the rules for command entry, and reenter the command.
Problem determination: Obtain a copy of the system or terminal log to verify command entry.
DSN9032I REQUESTED FUNCTION IS NOT AVAILABLE
Explanation: An attempt was made to invoke a command processor that was not loaded. An example of this is
invoking -START DDF or -STOP DDF when DDF is not loaded (not selected during the installation process).
System action: The requested function is not performed.
User response: Determine what function was requested. Do not invoke this function until DB2 is reinstalled and
DDF is selected.
Problem determination: Look at the console log to determine which command caused the error.
DSN9033I KEYWORD name1 REQUIRES KEYWORD name2
Explanation: When keyword 'name1' is specified, keyword 'name2' must also be specified.
System action: Processing for the command terminates.
User response: Resubmit the command with the missing keyword.
Problem determination: Obtain a copy of the system or terminal log to verify the command entry.
DSN9034I THE TOTAL LENGTH OF COMMAND RESPONSE MESSAGES EXCEEDED ITS LIMIT. DISPLAY IS TERMINATED.
Explanation: The total length of all response messages returned from a single DB2 command exceeded the internal
limit set by the system. The message chain was truncated. This message was appended at the end of the chain to
inform the user of the termination of the report.
DSN9035I BEGIN OF DISPLAY FOR MEMBER: memname
Explanation: This message precedes the command output from another member of a data sharing group as the
result of the SCOPE(GROUP) keyword. The message number is not included in this message.
memname
Member name for which command output is being displayed.
System action: Processing continues normally.
DSN9036I
Explanation: This message underscores message DSN9035I and separates the command output from another
member of a data sharing group as the result of the SCOPE(GROUP) keyword. The message number is not included
in this message.
System action: Processing continues normally.
DSN9037I END OF DISPLAY FOR MEMBER: memname
Explanation: This message follows messages DSN9035I, DSN9036I, and the command output from another member
of a data sharing group as the result of the SCOPE(GROUP) keyword and indicates that the output was generated
successfully. The message number is not included in this message.
memname
Member name for which command output is being displayed.
System action: Processing continues normally.
DSN9038I csect-name COMMAND REJECTED BECAUSE DB2 WAS RESTARTED IN LIGHT MODE
Explanation: This command is not allowed when the DB2 member has been restarted with the LIGHT(YES)
parameter.
System action: Command processing is halted.
System programmer response: Refrain from issuing this command on this DB2 member until after the member has
been restarted without LIGHT(YES). If the command has group scope, then you may be able to issue the command
to a different DB2 member in the group.
