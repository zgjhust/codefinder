000 SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION
Explanation: Unqualified successful execution or successful execution with one or more warnings. If SQLWARN0 is
blank, there are no warnings. If SQLWARN0 = W, at least one of the other warning indicators in the SQLCA has been
set to indicate a warning condition. For example, SQLWARN1 is used to indicate that a value of a string column was
truncated when assigned to a host variable.
SQLSTATE: 00000 for unqualified successful execution
SQLSTATE: 01ddd for successful execution with warning 'ddd'.

+012 THE UNQUALIFIED COLUMN NAME column-name WAS INTERPRETED AS A CORRELATED REFERENCE
Explanation: The column name does not identify a column of a table or view in the FROM clause of the subquery.
However, it does identify a column of a table or view in a FROM clause at a higher level in the statement.
System action: The column name is interpreted as a correlated reference.
Programmer response: If DB2's interpretation of the column name was not what you intended, rewrite the SQL
statement and submit it again. If you intend the column name to refer to a table named at a higher level, we advise
rewriting the statement anyway, using a table name or correlation name as a qualifier for the column name. The
unqualified column name could be interpreted differently if you do a rebind after altering one of the tables to which
you refer.
SQLSTATE: 01545
+020 BIND, REBIND, OR PRECOMPILE OPTION option-name IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE TARGET SERVER AND WILL BE IGNORED.
Explanation: At least one option specified at bind, rebind, or precompile time is not supported by the target server.
option-name
The name of the first unsupported option.
System action: Processing continues, but the unsupported options are ignored.
User response: Ensure that the specification of bind, rebind, or precompile option names or the associated option
values was intended while connected to this server.

+098 A DYNAMIC SQL STATEMENT ENDS WITH A SEMICOLON.
Explanation: The statement string of a PREPARE or EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement is a valid dynamic SQL
statement, but it ends with a semicolon.
System action: The semicolon and any subsequent text are ignored.
Programmer response: Check that the semicolon is being used as a statement terminator.
SQLSTATE: 01568
+100 ROW NOT FOUND FOR FETCH, UPDATE OR DELETE, OR THE RESULT OF A QUERY IS AN EMPTY TABLE
Explanation: One of the following conditions occurred:
v No row met the search conditions specified in an UPDATE or DELETE statement.
v The result of a SELECT INTO statement was an empty table.
v The result of the subselect of an INSERT statement is empty.
v A FETCH statement was executed when the cursor was positioned after the last row of the result table.
v No available rows qualified for return when SKIP LOCKED DATA was specified with isolation level CS or RS.
v A FETCH statement that returns a rowset was issued, but there were not enough rows after the current cursor
position to reposition the cursor on a full rowset. The cursor has been positioned on a partial rowset. If a target
was specified, data was returned only for the number of rows that were actually fetched for the partial rowset. The
number of rows that were returned is in field SQLERRD3 of the SQLCA.
When a SELECT statement is executed using SPUFI, this SQLCODE indicates normal completion.
This SQLCODE is also issued when LOB data cannot be returned. This situation can occur when an application is
running with isolation level UR and another application has locked the LOB table space.
System action: No data was retrieved, updated, or deleted.
SQLSTATE: 02000
+110 SQL UPDATE TO A DATA CAPTURE TABLE NOT SIGNALED TO ORIGINATING SUBSYSTEM
Explanation: IMS DataPropagator exit routine issued an SQL data change statement to a table defined with DATA
CAPTURE CHANGES. Since data capture is already in progress, notification is not sent back to the originating IMS
subsystem.
System action: DB2 changes the data and records the change in the log. DB2 does not notify IMS DataPropagator's
exit routine of the change, because doing so might cause the same change to be made again.
SQLSTATE: 01561
+111 THE SUBPAGES OPTION IS NOT SUPPORTED FOR TYPE 2 INDEXES
Explanation: You cannot use the SUBPAGES option for type 2 indexes.
System action: The option is ignored and processing continues.
Programmer response: Remove the SUBPAGES option to get rid of the warning.
SQLSTATE: 01590
+117 THE NUMBER OF INSERT VALUES IS NOT THE SAME AS THE NUMBER OF OBJECT COLUMNS
Explanation: The number of insert values in the value list of the insert operation is not the same as the number of
object columns specified.
System action: A valid plan or package will be created if no errors are detected. The statement is bound
dynamically on each execution of the statement.
Programmer response: For better performance, rebind the plan or package after correcting the statement. To correct
the statement, specify one and only one value for each of the specified object columns.
SQLSTATE: 01525
+162 TABLESPACE database-name.tablespace-name HAS BEEN PLACED IN CHECK PENDING
Explanation: The indicated table space is in check pending status because the ALTER TABLE statement was used to
specify either of the following:
v A referential constraint
v A check constraint, when the CURRENT RULES special register is set to 'DB2'
The table space is not generally available until the check pending status is removed from the table space.
System action: The table space was placed in check pending status.
Programmer response: Run the CHECK DATA utility. The enforcement of the referential constraint or the check
constraint is deferred until the CHECK DATA utility is run.
SQLSTATE: 01514
+203 THE QUALIFIED COLUMN NAME column-name WAS RESOLVED USING A NON-UNIQUE OR UNEXPOSED NAME
Explanation: The table designator selected to resolve a qualified column name is one of the following:
v An unexposed name
v An exposed name that has an exposed duplicate in the same FROM clause
v An exposed name that has an unexposed duplicate which appears before the selected name in the ordered list of
names to which the qualifier is compared
Therefore, the statement does not conform to the guidelines for using only unique exposed names as qualifiers or it
is possible that the column reference was not resolved to the intended instance of the table or view.
System action: DB2 uses the selected name to resolve the reference.
Programmer response: If DB2 did not resolve of the qualifier how you intended, rewrite the SQL statement and
submit it again.
SQLSTATE: 01552

+204 name IS AN UNDEFINED NAME
Explanation: The object identified by name is not defined in the DB2 subsystem. This return code can be generated
for any type of DB2 object.
System action: A valid plan or package will be created if no errors are detected. The statement is bound
dynamically on each execution of the statement.
Programmer response: For better performance, rebind the plan or package after correcting the statement. To correct
the statement, determine that the object name was correctly specified in the SQL statement (including any required
qualifiers). If so, ensure that the object exists in the system before resubmitting the statement.
SQLSTATE: 01532
+205 column-name IS NOT A COLUMN OF TABLE table-name
Explanation: For ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN, column column-name is not a column in table table-name.
System action: A valid plan or package will be created if no errors are detected. The statement is bound
dynamically on each execution of the statement.
Programmer response: Verify that the column and table names are specified correctly (including any required
qualifiers) in the SQL statement.
SQLSTATE: 01533
+206 column-name IS NOT A COLUMN OF AN INSERTED TABLE, UPDATED TABLE, MERGED TABLE, OR ANY TABLE IDENTIFIED IN A FROM CLAUSE
Explanation: This return code is used to report one of these errors:
v In the case of an INSERT or UPDATE statement, or SELECT FROM INSERT or UPDATE statement, the specified
column is not a column of the table or view that was specified as the object of the insert or update.
v In the case a SELECT or DELETE statement, the specified column is not a column of any of the tables or views
identified in a FROM clause in the statement.
v There is a correlated reference in GROUP BY.
v There is an unresolved qualified reference in HAVING.
v In the case of a MERGE statement or SELECT from MERGE statement, the specified column is not a column in the
target-table. Also, it is not a column specified in the include-columns clause.
System action: A valid plan or package will be created if no errors are detected. The statement is bound
dynamically on each execution of the statement.
Programmer response: For better performance, rebind the plan or package after correcting the statement. To correct
the statement, verify that the column and table names are specified correctly in the SQL statement. In the case of a
SELECT statement, check to be sure that all of the required tables were named in the FROM clause.
SQLSTATE: 01533
+217 THE STATEMENT WAS NOT EXECUTED AS ONLY EXPLAIN INFORMATION REQUESTS ARE BEING PROCESSED.
Explanation: The current value of the EXPLAIN MODE special register has been set to EXPLAIN. This value allows
dynamic SQL statements to be prepared and explained but prevents any dynamic statement from being executed.
System action: The statement was not executed because only information requests from EXPLAIN are being
processed.
Programmer response: To execute the statement, change the value of the EXPLAIN MODE special register to a
setting other than EXPLAIN. Issue the appropriate SET statement from the interface or application that is
encountering this condition.
SQLSTATE: 01604
+218 THE SQL STATEMENT REFERENCING A REMOTE OBJECT CANNOT BE EXPLAINED
Explanation: The user has used EXPLAIN(YES) on the bind subcommand to bind an application which has SQL
statement referencing a remote object or the user has a static EXPLAIN SQL statement which references a remote
object in the application program. EXPLAIN on a remote object is not supported by DB2.
It is issued at BIND time, and only with VALIDATE(RUN).
System action: The plan or package will be bound successfully, but no information will be filled in the user's
PLAN_TABLE for the SQL statement referencing a remote object. An SQLCODE -512 will be issued at run time if the
EXPLAIN statement is found to explain a remote object.
SQLSTATE: 01537
+219 THE REQUIRED EXPLANATION TABLE table-name DOES NOT EXIST
Explanation: The EXPLAIN statement assumes the existence of an EXPLAIN table and it is not defined in the DB2
subsystem as a base table.
System action: A valid plan or package will be created if no errors are detected. The statement is bound
dynamically on each execution of the statement.
Programmer response: For better performance, rebind the plan or package after correcting the statement. To correct
the statement, determine whether the required EXPLAIN table does exist. If not, create the required table.

+222 HOLE DETECTED USING CURSOR cursor-name
Explanation: A delete hole or an update hole has been detected while processing a FETCH for cursor cursor-name. With
a SENSITIVE STATIC cursor, a delete hole occurs when DB2 tries to refetch a row from the database for a cursor and
finds that the corresponding row of the underlying table has been deleted. An update hole occurs when DB2 tries to
refetch a row from the database for a cursor and finds that the corresponding row of the underlying table no longer
satisfies the search condition.
cursor-name
Name of the cursor used for the FETCH statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed, and no data is fetched. The cursor is repositioned on the hole.
Programmer response: Correct the application program to handle this situation, or change isolation levels so the
base row cannot be deleted during the cursor operation.
SQLSTATE: 02502
+231 CURRENT POSITION OF CURSOR cursor-name IS NOT VALID FOR THE SPECIFIED FETCH ORIENTATION OF THE CURRENT ROW OR ROWSET
Explanation: The cursor was not positioned on a row or rowset, and one of the following fetch orientations
specified that the cursor was to be positioned relative to its current position:
v CURRENT or CURRENT ROWSET
v RELATIVE 0 or ROWSET STARTING AT RELATIVE 0
cursor-name
Name of the cursor used for the FETCH statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No data was fetched, and the cursor position is unchanged.
Programmer response: Correct the application program to establish a valid cursor position before issuing this
FETCH statement.
SQLSTATE: 02000
+236 SQLDA INCLUDES integer1 SQLVAR ENTRIES, BUT integer2 ARE REQUIRED FOR integer3 COLUMNS
Explanation: The value of the SQLN field of the SQLDA should be at least as large as the number of columns being
described. integer3 is the number of columns being described.
In the case that USING BOTH has been specified, twice as many SQLVAR entries are needed as the number of
columns being described.
The number of SQLVAR entries that are needed to return all of the information about the columns is integer2.
Attention: In the case of DESCRIBE INPUT, each reference to column would actually be parameter.
System action: The SQLDAID 7th byte has been set to "on" with a value of 2 indicating that 2 SQLVAR entries are
needed for each column. DB2 has not set any SQLVAR entries.
Programmer response: Increase the value of the SQLN field in the SQLDA to the value indicated in the message
(making sure the SQLDA is large enough to support that amount) and resubmit the statement.
SQLSTATE: 01005
+237 SQLDA INCLUDES integer1 SQLVAR ENTRIES, BUT integer2 ARE REQUIRED BECAUSE AT LEAST ONE OF THE COLUMNS BEING DESCRIBED IS A DISTINCT TYPE
Explanation: Given that at least one of the columns being described is a distinct type, space should be provided for
the extended SQLVAR entries in addition to the base SQLVAR entries. The value of SQLN, integer1, indicates that there
are not enough SQLVAR entries for the base and extended SQLVAR entries.
The total number of SQLVAR entries that are required depends on whether USING BOTH was specified (n is the
number of columns being described):
v With USING BOTH, space should be allocated for 3n SQLVAR entries.
v Otherwise, space should be allocated for 2n SQLVAR entries.
The number of SQLVAR entries that are needed to return all of the information about the columns is integer2.
Attention: In the case of DESCRIBE INPUT, each reference to column would actually be parameter.
System action: DB2 has set the SQLDAID 7th byte flag "on" because sufficient space was not provided for the
extended SQLVAR entries. The value of the 7th byte flag indicates how many SQLVAR entries are needed for each
column. Additionally, because there were enough SQLVAR entries for the base SQLVARs, DB2 has set the fields of the
base SQLVAR entries. However, DB2 has not set any extended SQLVAR entries.
Programmer response: If there is no need for the additional information about the distinct type(s), then no action is
required unless USING BOTH was specified (in which case additional SQLVAR entries must be provided for the
labels).
If the distinct type information is needed, the value of the SQLN field in the SQLDA should be increased to integer2
(after making sure that the SQLDA is large enough to support that amount) and the statement should be
resubmitted.
SQLSTATE: 01594
+238 SQLDA INCLUDES integer1 SQLVAR ENTRIES, BUT integer2 SQLVAR ENTRIES ARE NEEDED FOR integer3 COLUMNS BECAUSE AT LEAST ONE OF THE COLUMNS BEING DESCRIBED IS A LOB
Explanation: Given that at least one the columns being described is a LOB, space must be provided for the extended
SQLVAR entries in addition to the base SQLVAR entries. The value of SQLN, integer1, indicates that there are not
enough SQLVAR entries for the base and extended SQLVAR entries. One or more of the columns being described
may be a distinct type.
The total number of SQLVAR entries that are required depends on whether USING BOTH was specified or not (n is
the number of columns being described which is integer3), and whether the columns include any distinct types:
v With USING BOTH, and one or more distinct types, space should be allocated for 3n SQLVAR entries.
v Otherwise, space should be allocated for 2n SQLVAR entries.
The number of SQLVAR entries that are needed to return all of the information about the columns is integer2.
Important: In the case of DESCRIBE INPUT, each reference to column would actually be parameter.
System action: DB2 has set the SQLDAID 7th byte flag "on" because sufficient space was not provided for the
extended SQLVAR entries. The value of the 7th byte flag indicates how many SQLVAR entries are needed for each
column. DB2 has not set any SQLVAR entries.
Programmer response: Increase the value of the SQLN field in the SQLDA to integer2 (after making sure that the
SQLDA is large enough to support that amount) and resubmit the statement.
SQLSTATE: 01005
+239 SQLDA INCLUDES integer1 SQLVAR ENTRIES, BUT integer2 ARE REQUIRED FOR integer3 COLUMNS BECAUSE AT LEAST ONE OF THE COLUMNS BEING DESCRIBED IS A DISTINCT TYPE
Explanation: Given that at least one of the columns being described is a distinct type, space should be provided for
the extended SQLVAR entries in addition to the base SQLVAR entries. The value of SQLN, integer1, indicates that there
are not enough SQLVAR entries for the base and extended SQLVAR entries.
The total number of SQLVAR entries that are required depends on whether USING BOTH was specified or not (n is
the number of columns being described which is integer3),
v With USING BOTH, space should be allocated for 3n SQLVAR entries.
v Otherwise, space should be allocated for 2n SQLVAR entries.
The number of SQLVAR entries that are needed to return all of the information about the columns is integer2.
Note: in the case of DESCRIBE INPUT, each reference to column would actually be parameter.
System action: DB2 has set the SQLDAID 7th byte flag "on" because sufficient space was not provided for the
extended SQLVAR entries. The value of the 7th byte flag indicates how many SQLVAR entries are needed for each
column. DB2 has not set any SQLVAR entries. :elq.
Programmer response: If the distinct type information is needed, the value of the SQLN field in the SQLDA should
be increased to integer2 (after making sure the SQLDA is large enough to support that amount) and the statement
should be resubmitted.
If there is no need for the additional information about the distinct type(s) in the result set, then it is possible to
resubmit the statement only providing enough SQLVAR entries to accommodate the number of columns being
described (i.e. provide the necessary number of base SQL entries).
SQLSTATE: 01005
+252 A NON-ATOMIC statement STATEMENT SUCCESSFULLY PROCESSED ALL REQUESTED ROWS, WITH ONE OR MORE WARNING CONDITIONS
Explanation: A non-atomic statement statement successfully processed multiple rows of data. However, one or more
warning conditions occurred. Use GET DIAGNOSTICS to obtain information about the warning conditions that
occurred.
System action: The statement was processed.
Programmer response: Analyze the warning conditions to determine whether the statement should be rolled back
or not.
SQLSTATE: 01659
+304 A VALUE WITH DATA TYPE data-type1 CANNOT BE ASSIGNED TO A HOST VARIABLE BECAUSE THE VALUE IS NOT WITHIN THE RANGE OF THE HOST VARIABLE IN POSITION position-number WITH DATA TYPE data-type2
Explanation: A FETCH or SELECT into a host variable list or structure, position number position-number failed
because the host variable having data type data-type2 was not large enough to hold the retrieved value having data
type data-type1.
System action: The FETCH or SELECT could not return the data for the indicated SELECT item, the indicator
variable is set to negative two (-2) to indicate a null value returned. Processing continues.
Programmer response: Verify that table definitions are current, and that the host variable has the proper data type.
See the explanation for SQLCODE -405 for ranges of SQL data types.
SQLSTATE: 01515
+331 THE NULL VALUE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO A HOST VARIABLE OR PARAMETER BECAUSE THE STRING CANNOT BE CONVERTED FROM source-ccsid TO target-ccsid. REASON reason-code, POSITION position-number
Explanation: A string had to be converted from source-ccsid to target-ccsid and an error occurred during the
conversion. The position-number, if provided (non-zero), is the ordinality of the host variable or parameter in the
SQLDA. See the description of SQLCODE -331 for further information including the meaning of the reason-code.
System action: The host variable is unchanged and its indicator variable is set to -2 to indicate that a null value is
returned. Execution of the statement continues as if the conversion error had not occurred.
SQLSTATE: 01520
+335 DB2 CONVERTED A HOST VARIABLE, PARAMETER, OR COLUMN NUMBER var-num var-name-or-num TO COLUMN NAME, HOST VARIABLE, OR EXPRESSION NUMBER col-name-or-num FROM from ccsid TO to-ccsid, AND RESULTING IN SUBSTITUTION CHARACTERS.
Explanation: A conversion error occurred during the conversion of a string to a different coded character set. One or
more substitution characters have been placed in the string during the conversion process.
var-num var-name-or-num
The value of the host variable, the parameter, or the column number prior to the conversion process. This
value might be the string *N if the column number is not available when this SQLCODE is issued.
col-name-or-num
The value of the host variable, the parameter or the column number after the conversion process. This value
might be the string *N if the column number is not available when this SQLCODE is issued.
from ccsid
The input CCSID for the host variable, parameter, or column number.
to-ccsid The resulting CCSID from the conversion of the host variable, parameter, or column number.
System action: DB2 processes the statement successfully.
Programmer response: This warning can occur in two situations:
v If trace for IFCID 136 or 168 is not active, DB2 processes the SQL statement, but used substitution characters
instead of one or more characters as a result of character conversion from from ccsid to to-ccsid. If substitution is
acceptable, no action is necessary. If substitution is not acceptable, issue a ROLLBACK. Ensure that data being
provided to DB2 is convertible from from ccsid to to-ccsid without data loss.
v If trace for IFCID 136 or 168 is active, and the to-ccsid token is an EBCDIC CCSID, and system parameter UIFCIDS
is OFF, this warning is caused by the conversion to EBCDIC CCSID for IFCID trace record. Use the GET
DIAGNOSTICS statement to determine if the there are other warnings associated with the original SQL string. If
GET DIAGNOSTICS returns no other warnings, no action is required.
SQLSTATE: 01517
Related reference:
GET DIAGNOSTICS (DB2 SQL)
+347 THE RECURSIVE COMMON TABLE EXPRESSION name MAY CONTAIN AN INFINITE LOOP
Explanation: The recursive common table expression called name may not complete. This warning is based on not
finding specific syntax as part of the iterative portion of the recursive common table expression. The expected syntax
includes:
v incrementing an INTEGER column in the iterative select list by 1.
v a predicate in the where clause of the iterative portion of the form "counter_col < constant" or "counter_col <
:hostvar".
The absence of this syntax in the recursive common table expression may result in an infinite loop. The data or some
other characteristic of the recursive common table expression may allow the successful completion of the statement
anyway.
System action: The statement cannot be executed.
Programmer response: To prevent an infinite loop, include the expected syntax as described.
SQLSTATE: 01605
+354 A ROWSET FETCH STATEMENT MAY HAVE RETURNED ONE OR MORE ROWS OF DATA.  HOWEVER, ONE OR MORE WARNING CONDITIONS WERE ALSO ENCOUNTERED. USE THE GET DIAGNOSTICS STATEMENT FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE CONDITIONS THAT WERE ENCOUNTERED
Explanation: A rowset FETCH statement encountered one or more warning conditions. Use the GET DIAGNOSTICS
statement to obtain information about the conditions that occurred, and to determine if data was returned. It is
possible that one or more rows of data were returned. If the row information that was returned for the row that
encountered the condition is incomplete, do not use the data for the row that encountered the condition, such as
displaying or printing the data.
System action: DB2 processed the statement successfully, but with a warning that the fetching of some rows might
have encountered warnings.
Programmer response: Analyze the conditions to determine whether follow-up actions are needed. The GET
DIAGNOSTICS statement can be used to determine which additional actions might be necessary.
Attention: It is also possible that an end of data condition was detected. SQLERRD3 and GET DIAGNOSTICS can
be used to determine if all of the requested rows were fetched or if a partial rowset was returned.
SQLSTATE: 01668
+361 COMMAND WAS SUCCESSFUL BUT RESULTED IN THE FOLLOWING: msg-token
Explanation: During the processing of a command such as a BIND PACKAGE or DROP or FREE PACKAGE, a
condition occurred, as specified by msg-token, and the command needs to be examined.
System action: The request was successful.
User response: Evaluate the information contained in msg-token to determine if the results were as expected.
SQLSTATE: 0168B
+364 DECFLOAT EXCEPTION exception-type HAS OCCURRED DURING operation-type OPERATION, POSITION position-number
Explanation: The exception error exception-type occurred while performing an ADDITION, SUBTRACTION,
MULTIPLICATION, DIVISION, NEGATION, or BUILT-IN FUNCTION operation on a field whose data type is
DECFLOAT. The error occurred while processing an arithmetic expression. If the error occurred in the SELECT list of
an outer SELECT statement, position in the select list is denoted by position-number. If not, position number is 0. The
possible exception types are UNDERFLOW, OVERFLOW, INEXACT, INVALID OPERATION, DIVISION BY ZERO, or
SUBNORMAL. The data type displayed in the message may indicate the data type of the temporary internal copy of
the data, which may differ from the actual column or literal data type due to conversions by DB2.
Any of the exceptions or overflows can occur during the processing of a built-in function. If operation-type is
FUNCTION, then the error occurred while processing either an input, intermediate, or final value. The cause could
be that the value of a parameter is out of range.
Note: Parts of exception-type, operation-type, and position-number might or might not be returned in SQLCA, depending
upon when the error was detected.
System action: The resulting data proceeds according to IEEE 754r rules. Execution of the statement continues. If the
statement is cursor controlled, then the cursor will remain open.
Programmer response: Examine the expression for which the warning occurred to see if the likely cause of the
problem can be determined. The problem may be data-dependent, in which case it will be necessary to examine the
data that was being processed at the time that the error occurred. See the explanation of SQLCODE -405 for allowed
ranges of numeric data types.
SQLSTATE: 0168C if INEXACT
 0168D if INVALID OPERATION
 0168E if UNDERFLOW,OVERFLOW
 0168F if DIVISION BY ZERO
 0168G if SUBNORMAL
+385 ASSIGNMENT TO AN SQLSTATE OR SQLCODE VARIABLE IN AN SQL ROUTINE routine-name MAY BE OVERWRITTEN AND DOES NOT ACTIVATE ANY HANDLER
Explanation: SQL routine routine-name was created, but it contains an assignment statement that specifies the
SQLCODE or SQLSTATE variable as the target.
Assignment to an SQLSTATE or SQLCODE variable in an SQL routine only changes the value in the variable, and
does not activate any handler. The SQLSTATE and SQLCODE variables are assigned values by processing of SQL
statements in the SQL routine. Therefore, any value assigned might be over-written as a result of SQL statement
processing.
System action: The routine definition is processed successfully.
User response: No recovery is necessary. If the intent was to signal an error or warning, specify the SIGNAL or
RESIGNAL statement instead of the assignment.
To prevent the warning, remove any assignments to the SQLSTATE or SQLCODE special variables.
SQLSTATE: 01643
+394 ALL USER SPECIFIED OPTIMIZATION HINTS USED DURING ACCESS PATH SELECTION
Explanation: All user specified optimization hints that were found for the statement being optimized are used.
System action: Processing continues normally.
Programmer response: Ensure that the access path is correct and produces the correct results.
Suppressing this SQLCODE:
You can set the value of the SUPPRESS_HINT_SQLCODE_DYN to suppress SQLCODEs +394 and +395 for dynamic
SQL statements.

+395 A USER SPECIFIED OPTIMIZATION HINT IS INVALID (REASON CODE = reason-code)
Explanation: DB2 detected that one or more optimization hints provided for this statement are invalid. You can use
the following reason-code values to identify why a hint is invalid:
reason-code
The reason why a hint was invalid. Only one reason-code is returned even if the hint contains multiple
problems. The following descriptions refer to the of the values in PLAN_TABLE columns for the set of rows
that contain the same value in the OPTHINT column.
2 The value of the TABNO column is not valid. Negative values and values greater than the total
number of table references are not valid.
The value of the TABNO column is validated only when the combination of the following columns
does not identify a particular table reference within a query block:
v CREATOR
v TNAME
v CORRELATION_NAME
v QBLOCKNO
3 A value is not specified for one of the following columns: CREATOR or TNAME
4 The value of the TABNO column was not specified, and the combination of the following columns
does not uniquely identify a table reference:
v CREATOR
v TNAME
v CORRELATION_NAME
v QBLOCKNO
5 The value specified for the TABNO column contains a value in the valid range. However, the value
does not correctly correspond to the values of the CREATOR, TNAME, and
CORRELATION_NAME columns.
6 The table identified by the values specified by the following columns cannot be found within the
query block that is identified by the QBLOCKNO column:
v CREATOR
v TNAME
v CORRELATION_NAME
7 The PAGE_RANGE column contains an invalid value.
8 The PREFETCH column contains an invalid value.
9 The METHOD column contains an invalid value.
10 The SORTN_JOIN column contains an invalid value.
11 The SORTC_JOIN column contains an invalid value.
12 The ACCESSTYPE column contains an invalid value.
13 One of the following columns contains an invalid value: ACCESSCREATOR or ACCESSNAME.
15 The hint specifies an index that cannot be used.
16 The hint specified multi-index access that cannot be used.
17 The hint specifies an invalid combination of ACCESSTYPE values.
18 The join method for the inner table of a join was not specified in the METHOD column.
19 The nested-loop join that is specified by the value of the METHOD column cannot be used.
20 The merge join that is specified by the value of the METHOD column cannot be used.
21 The hybrid join that is specified by the value of the METHOD column cannot be used.
22 The mode of parallelism that is specified by the value of the PARALLELISM_MODE column
requested cannot be used.
23 The PARALLELISM_MODE column contains an invalid value.
24 One of the following columns contains an invalid value: ACCESS_DEGREE or
ACCESS_PGROUP_ID
25 One of the following columns contains an invalid value: JOIN_DEGREE or JOIN_PGROUP_ID
26 A row for a table reference that is required for the hint is missing. For query blocks that reference
multiple tables, the hint must contain a row for each table. Required tables might not be mentioned
in the statement text because DB2 uses materialization or transformations in the access path.
27 The hint contains a redundant table reference because a table that is identified by a combination of
the following columns appears in more than one row for the same query block:
v CREATOR
v TNAME
v CORRELATION_NAME
v TABNO (when required)
28 The PRIMARY_ACCESSTYPE column contains an invalid value.
29 The SORTN_GROUP_ID column contains an invalid value.
30 The SORTN_GROUP_ID column contains an invalid value.
31 No value is specified in the PARALLELISM_MODE column.
32 One of the following columns contains an invalid value: CREATOR or TNAME
33 The join sequence is incorrect.
34 The column WHEN_OPTIMIZE contains an invalid or inconsistent value.
35 The value of the ACCESSTYPE column cannot contain 'V' for the specified table.
36 The number of dimension tables that are joined before the star join fact table exceeds the maximum
number of dimensions that can be joined by a fact table index.
37 When the value of the JOIN_TYPE column for the fact table is 'SJ', a nested-loop join must be used.
38 The join sequence for dimension tables in a star join is incorrect because it does not match the
sequence that is specified by the fact table index.
39 The value of ACCESSTYPE column is 'O' but the specified access path cannot be used.
40 Multiple index access cannot be used with the specified indexes .
41 Duplicate hint input records found for the same table.
48 Access path information for a correlated subquery is missing
50 The APREUSE option was specified during a bind or rebind operation and the hint was accepted.
However, during access path comparison, DB2 detected that the resulting access path does not
match the original access path.
99 An unexpected error occurred.
Only one reason-code is returned even if the hint contains multiple problems.
System action: The invalid hint is ignored and DB2 determines the access path without that hint. If other hints are
supplied for the statement, DB2 might use those hints, if they are valid.
Programmer response: Examine the EXPLAIN output to determine which hints were used by DB2, and which hints
were not used. If needed, correct the problem with the hints that were not used, or disable their use as hints to the
optimizer.

Explanation: The local object referenced by the CREATE ALIAS statement does not exist when creating the alias.
System action: The alias is created.
SQLSTATE: 01522
+434 clause IS A DEPRECATED CLAUSE
Explanation: The use of clause is accepted for now, but continued use of it is not recommended. However, for native
SQL procedures, clause is not supported. See the SQL Reference for a list of options that are supported for native SQL
procedures. SQLCODE -4705 might be issued instead if the situation occurs with a BIND COPY command that is
used to deploy a version of a native SQL procedure that uses a deprecated option,and a package already exists by
that name at the server.
For indexes, use type 2 indexes rather than type 1 indexes to avoid any incompatibilities.
System action: Processing continues and the clause is ignored.
User response: No change is required for the current release. However, you should change your SQL statement and
remove this clause to prepare for releases when this clause is no longer accepted.
To prevent the warning, remove the deprecated clause from the statement.
SQLSTATE: 01608
+438 APPLICATION RAISED WARNING WITH DIAGNOSTIC TEXT: text
Explanation: This warning occurred as a result of the SIGNAL or RESIGNAL statement.
text Diagnostic text provided by the SIGNAL or RESIGNAL statement.
System action: The statement was processed, but a warning was encountered.
Programmer response: Use the application-provided diagnostic text, if provided, to determine the cause of the
warning.
SQLSTATE: Defined by the application
+440 NO routine-type BY THE NAME routine-name HAVING COMPATIBLE ARGUMENTS WAS FOUND
Explanation: This warning occurs in a reference to routine (stored procedure or function) routine-name, when DB2
cannot find a function or stored procedure it can use to implement the reference. Several reasons are present for this
warning:
v routine-name was incorrectly specified or does not exist in the database.
v A qualified reference was made, and the qualifier was incorrectly spelled.
v A user's SQL path does not contain the schema to which the function belongs, and an unqualified reference was
used.
v The wrong number of arguments were included.
v For functions, the data types of one or more of the arguments is incorrect.
System action: A valid plan or package will be created if no errors are detected. The statement is bound
dynamically on each execution of the statement.
Programmer response: Fix the problem and retry. Change the SQL statement, add new routines, or change the user's
SQL path.
SQLSTATE: 01681
+445 VALUE value HAS BEEN TRUNCATED
Explanation: The value value was truncated by a cast function, which was called to transform the value in some
way. This is a warning situation. The cast function is a result of
v a CAST specification
v a built-in function such as CHAR, VARCHAR, etc.
v a CAST FROM specification on the CREATE FUNCTION statement that created the function
v a user-defined function that is sourced on another function and the result needed to be transformed.
If 'value' has the 'for bit data' subtype, then the 'value' is printed as a hexadecimal string in quotes followed by an X.
System action: The value has been truncated.
Programmer response: Ensure that the output is as expected and that the truncation has not caused any unexpected
consequences.
SQLSTATE: 01004
+462 EXTERNAL FUNCTION OR PROCEDURE name (SPECIFIC NAME specific-name) HAS RETURNED A WARNING SQLSTATE, WITH DIAGNOSTIC TEXT text
Explanation: An SQLSTATE of the form 01Hxx was returned to DB2 by user-defined function or procedure name,
along with message text text.
System action: Processing continues.
Programmer response: See your database administrator, or the author of the function or procedure to find out the
meaning of the warning. The significance of the bad SQLSTATE to the invoking application can be learned from the
author of the function or procedure.
SQLSTATE: 01Hxx
+464 PROCEDURE proc RETURNED num QUERY RESULT SETS, WHICH EXCEEDS THE DEFINED LIMIT integer
Explanation: The stored procedure named by proc completed normally. However, the stored procedure exceeded the
defined limit on the number of query result sets the procedure can return.
v num identifies the number of query result sets returned by the stored procedure.
v integer identifies the defined limit on the number of query result sets for the stored procedure.
Only the first integer query result sets are returned to the SQL program that issued the SQL CALL statement.
The possible causes are as follows:
v The stored procedure is unable to return num result sets due to the limit defined for the procedure.
v The stored procedure is unable to return num result sets due to the DRDA? limitations imposed by the client. The
DRDA client establishes this limit with the MAXRSLCNT DDM code point.
System action: The SQL statement is successful. The SQLWARN9 field is set to 'Z'.
SQLSTATE: 0100E
+466 PROCEDURE proc RETURNED num QUERY RESULTS SETS
Explanation: The stored procedure named by proc completed normally. The procedure returned the number of SQL
query result sets specified in num.
System action: The SQL statement is successful. The SQLWARN9 field is set to 'Z'.
SQLSTATE: 0100C
+494 NUMBER OF RESULT SETS IS GREATER THAN NUMBER OF LOCATORS
Explanation: The number of result set locators specified on the ASSOCIATE LOCATORS statement is less than the
number of result sets returned by the stored procedure. The first "n" result set locator values are returned, where "n"
is the number of result set locator variables specified on the SQL statement.
System action: The SQL statement is successful. The SQLWARN3 field is set to 'Z'.
Programmer response: Increase the number of result set locator variables specified on the SQL statement.
SQLSTATE: 01614
+495 ESTIMATED PROCESSOR COST OF estimate-amount1 PROCESSOR SECONDS (estimate-amount2 SERVICE UNITS) IN COST CATEGORY cost-category EXCEEDS A RESOURCE LIMIT WARNING THRESHOLD OF limit- amount SERVICE UNITS
Explanation: The prepare of a dynamic INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, DELETE, or SELECT SQL statement resulted in
a cost estimate that exceeded the warning threshold value specified in the resource limit specification table (RLST).
This warning is also issued if DB2's cost category value was ¡°B¡±, and the default action specified in the
RLF_CATEGORY_B column in the RLST is to issue a warning.
estimate_amount1
The cost estimate (in processor seconds) if the prepared INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, DELETE, or SELECT
statement were to be executed.
estimate_amount2
The cost estimate (in service units) if the prepared INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, DELETE, or SELECT
statement were to be executed.
cost-category
DB2's cost-category for this SQL statement. The possible values are A or B.
limit-amount
The warning threshold (in service units) specified in the RLFASUWARN column of the RLST. If you entered
any negative number for the RLFASUWARN column, the value for limit-amount defaults to zero.
System action: The prepare of the dynamic INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, DELETE, or SELECT statement was
successful. An SQLCODE -905 might be issued if the execution of the prepared statement exceeds the ASUTIME
value specified in the RLST.
User response: If the warning is caused by an SQL statement that is consuming too much processor resource,
attempt to rewrite the statement to perform more efficiently. Another option is to ask the administrator to increase
the warning threshold value in the RLST.
Programmer response: Ensure that there is application logic to handle the warning to either allow the statement to
execute or to stop the statement from being executed. If this SQLCODE was returned because the cost category value
is ¡°B¡±, it might be that the statement is using parameter markers or that some statistics are not available for the
referenced tables and columns. Make sure the administrator has run the utility RUNSTATS on the referenced tables.
It might also be that UDFs will be invoked when the statement is executed, or for INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, or
DELETE statements that triggers are defined on the changed table. Check the DSN_STATEMNT_TABLE or the IFCID
22 record for this statement to find the reasons this SQL statement has been put in cost category ¡°B¡±.
SQLSTATE: 01616
+535 THE RESULT OF THE POSITIONED UPDATE OR DELETE MAY DEPEND ON THE ORDER OF THE ROWS
Explanation: A positioned update of a primary key or a delete from a table with a self-referencing constraint was
requested.
System action: DB2 executes the UPDATE or DELETE statement and the contents of the table are changed.
SQLSTATE: 01591
+541 THE REFERENTIAL OR UNIQUE CONSTRAINT name HAS BEEN IGNORED BECAUSE IT IS A DUPLICATE
Explanation: A FOREIGN KEY clause uses the same key and parent table as another FOREIGN KEY clause, or a
UNIQUE clause uses the same column list as another UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY clause. In either case, the duplicate
clause is ignored.
name is either the foreign key name or the unique constraint name.
System action: DB2 continues processing.
Programmer response: If the duplication is an error, correct the statement and execute it again.
SQLSTATE: 01543
+551 auth-id DOES NOT HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO PERFORM OPERATION operation ON OBJECT object-name
Explanation: Authorization ID auth-id has attempted to perform the specified operation on object object-name without
having been granted the proper authority to do so. This error might also occur if the specified object does not exist,
or if the object is a read-only view (for UPDATE, INSERT, or MERGE). Additionally, the error may occur if auth-id is
trying to create a table or view with a schema qualifier that is a value other than auth-id. You may create a table or
view with a schema qualifier other than auth-id other than your own authorization ID if your authorization ID is
SYSADM, DBADM, or DBCTRL.
If you are using a trusted context, the token auth-id might return a role instead of an authorization ID. A role is
returned if a role was in effect and the authorization checking is performed against the role, rather than the
authorization ID of the session, when the condition was encountered. Otherwise an authorization ID is returned. A
role is returned in the following format as a single token:
v ROLE: role-name
If this error occurs while DB2 is creating or altering a table involving referential constraints, this code reports that the
user does not have the necessary ALTER privilege to perform a FOREIGN KEY, DROP FOREIGN KEY, DROP
PRIMARY KEY, or DROP UNIQUE operation. The object-name identifies the object table of the CREATE or ALTER
TABLE statement, not the table for which the user lacks the ALTER privilege.
System action: A valid plan or package will be created if no errors are detected. The statement is bound
dynamically on each execution of the statement.
Programmer response: For better performance, rebind the plan or package after correcting the statement. To correct
the statement, ensure that auth-id has been granted the authority to perform the operation, that object-name exists, and
that auth-id is not trying to create a table with a schema qualifier other than the authorization ID.
SQLSTATE: 01548
+552 auth-id DOES NOT HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO PERFORM OPERATION operation
Explanation: Authorization ID auth-id has attempted to perform the specified operation without having been granted
the authority to do so.
If you are using a trusted context, the token auth-id might return a role instead of an authorization ID. A role is
returned if a role was in effect and the authorization checking is performed against the role, rather than the
authorization ID of the session, when the condition was encountered. Otherwise an authorization ID is returned. A
role is returned in the following format as a single token:
ROLE: role-name
System action: A valid plan or package will be created if no errors are detected. The statement is bound
dynamically on each execution of the statement.
Programmer response: For better performance, rebind the plan or package after correcting the statement. To correct
the statement, ensure that the authorization ID has been granted the authority necessary to perform the operation.
SQLSTATE: 01542
+558 THE WITH GRANT OPTION IS IGNORED.
Explanation: The WITH GRANT option was used where it is not valid. It cannot be used in the following cases:
v PUBLIC was within the list of grantee authorization IDs.
v The BINDAGENT privilege was being granted.
v The ANY package privilege on collection-id.* was being granted.
v System DBADM authority was being granted.
v ACCESSCTRL authority was being granted.
v DATAACCESS authority was being granted.
v CREATE_SECURE_OBJECT privilege was being granted.
System action: The offending privileges in the authorization specification are granted without the GRANT option. If
the grantee is PUBLIC, all the privileges in the authorization specification are granted without the GRANT option.
SQLSTATE: 01516
+562 A GRANT OF A PRIVILEGE WAS IGNORED BECAUSE THE GRANTEE ALREADY HAS THE PRIVILEGE FROM THE GRANTOR
Explanation: At least one of the privileges in the GRANT statement was ignored because the privilege was already
granted to the grantee by the grantor.
System action: The privileges previously granted are ignored; all others are granted.
SQLSTATE: 01560
+585 THE COLLECTION collection-id APPEARS MORE THAN ONCE WHEN SETTING THE special-register SPECIAL REGISTER
Explanation: The SET statement for special register special-register includes collection-id more than once.
System action: Duplicates are removed from the list, and the first occurrence of collection-id is used. The statement is
executed.
Programmer response: Verify the list that contains the duplicate. If the error is only in entering a collection-id
incorrectly that happens to duplicate another entry, enter the collection-id correctly and reissue the statement. If the
entry is intended to be a duplicate, no action is required.
SQLSTATE: 01625
+599 COMPARISON FUNCTIONS ARE NOT CREATED FOR A DISTINCT TYPE BASED ON A LONG STRING DATA TYPE
Explanation: Comparison functions are not created for a distinct type based on a long string data type (BLOB,
CLOB, DBCLOB) since the corresponding function are not available for these built-in data types.
System action: The statement is processed successfully.
Programmer response: No action is required.
SQLSTATE: 01596
+610 A CREATE/ALTER ON OBJECT object-name HAS PLACED OBJECT IN utility-name PENDING
Explanation: As the result of a CREATE or ALTER action, the specified object has been placed in a pending status.
object-name
The name of the object.
utility-name
The name of the utility.
The reason for this error depends on the utility-name value and the object type.
REBUILD pending for an index
v The index is in REBUILD PENDING status because CREATE INDEX with DEFER was specified on a
populated table.
v The index is in REBUILD PENDING status because ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN SET DATA TYPE
changed a VARCHAR or NUMERIC column which is part of an index while in conversion mode.
The index is not generally available until the index is removed from the REBUILD pending state.
REORG pending for a table space partition
The table space is in REORG pending because ALTER INDEX was used to change the limit key values. The
table space partition is not generally available until the REORG pending status is removed.
REORG pending for a table space
The table space is in REORG pending because ALTER TABLE was used to add an identity column to a
populated table. The table space is not generally available until the REORG pending status is removed.
ADVISORY REORG pending for a table space
The table space is in ADVISORY REORG pending because an ALTER statement with pending definition
changes has been issued. The table space is available, but the definition changes have not yet been applied.
ADVISORY REORG pending for an index
The index is in ADVISORY REORG pending because an ALTER statement with pending definition changes
has been issued. The index is available, but the definition changes have not yet been applied.
REORG pending for a table
The table is in REORG pending because an ALTER statement with the INLINE LENGTH option reduced the
maximum length for a LOB column.
System action: The object was placed in the indicated pending status.
Programmer response: The response depends on the utility-name value and the object type:
REBUILD pending for an index
Use the REBUILD INDEX utility to rebuild the index and remove the REBUILD pending status.
REORG pending for a table space partition
Perform the following steps:
1. Issue a DISPLAY DATABASE command for the table space to identify which partitions are in REORG
pending.
2. Run the REORG utility on the partitions that are in REORG pending.
REORG pending for a table space
Run the REORG utility on the table space.
ADVISORY REORG pending for a table space
Run the REORG TABLESPACE utility with SHRLEVEL CHANGE or SHRLEVEL REFERENCE on the entire
table space to materialize the pending definition changes.
ADVISORY REORG pending for an index
If pending definition changes do not exist for the table space, run the REORG INDEX utility with
SHRLEVEL CHANGE or SHRLEVEL REFERENCE to materialize the pending definition changes for the
index.
If pending definition changes exist for the table space, run the REORG TABLESPACE utility with
SHRLEVEL CHANGE or SHRLEVEL REFERENCE to materialize the pending definition changes for the
table space and associated indexes.
SQLSTATE: 01566
+645 WHERE NOT NULL IS IGNORED BECAUSE THE INDEX KEY CANNOT CONTAIN NULL VALUES OR THE INDEX IS AN XML INDEX
Explanation: The WHERE NOT NULL clause is ignored on the CREATE INDEX statement because the index key is
defined on columns that cannot contain null values, or, the index is an XML index.
System action: The option is ignored; processing continues.
Programmer response: Remove the WHERE NOT NULL clause to get rid of the warning.
SQLSTATE: 01528
+650 THE TABLE BEING CREATED OR ALTERED CANNOT BECOME A DEPENDENT TABLE
Explanation: This table is defined with the maximum number of columns. It cannot be altered to be a dependent
table later.
System action: The table is created. Check to see if the table will become a dependent table at a later time. If yes,
drop and re-create the table with fewer than 750 columns.
SQLSTATE: 01538
+653 TABLE table-name IN PARTITIONED TABLESPACE tspace-name IS NOT AVAILABLE BECAUSE ITS PARTITIONED INDEX HAS NOT BEEN CREATED
Explanation: An attempt has been made to insert or manipulate data in or create a view on a partitioned table (that
is, a table residing in a partitioned table space) before the partitioned index for that table has been created.
A table residing in a partitioned table space cannot be referenced in any SQL manipulative statement or a CREATE
VIEW statement before the partitioned index for that table has been created.
System action: A valid plan or package will be created if no errors are detected. The statement is bound
dynamically on each execution of the statement.
Programmer response: For better performance, rebind the plan or package after correcting the statement. To correct
the statement, verify that the correct table was specified in the statement. If so, ensure that the partitioned index for
the table has been created successfully before attempting to execute any SQL manipulative statements that reference
that table.
SQLSTATE: 01551
+655 STOGROUP stogroup_name HAS BOTH SPECIFIC AND NON-SPECIFIC VOLUME IDS. IT WILL NOT BE ALLOWED IN FUTURE RELEASES
Explanation: The CREATE or ALTER STOGROUP statement has caused the STOGROUP with stogroup_name to have
both specific and non-specific ('*') volume Ids. This warning code is used to specify that the mixing of different types
of volume Ids will not be allowed in future releases.
System action: DB2 continues processing.
Programmer response: Plan to use either specific or non-specific volume ids to avoid future release migration
impact. ALTER STOGROUP may be used to drop all specific volume ids or all non-specific volume ids.
SQLSTATE: 01597
+658 THE SUBPAGES VALUE IS IGNORED FOR THE CATALOG INDEX index-name
Explanation: Only SUBPAGES 1 is allowed for this catalog index.
System action: The index was altered successfully using SUBPAGES 1. If you are also altering the TYPE option to a
new value, the index is placed in recovery pending status.
SQLSTATE: 01600
+664 THE INTERNAL LENGTH OF THE LIMIT-KEY FIELDS SPECIFIED IN THE PARTITION CLAUSE OF THE statement-name STATEMENT EXCEEDS THE EXISTING INTERNAL LIMIT KEY LENGTH STORED IN CATALOG TABLE table-name
Explanation: The sum of the internal lengths of the limit keys specified in the PARTITION clause of the ALTER
INDEX or ALTER TABLE statement exceeds the existing internal limit key length stored in catalog table
SYSIBM.SYSINDEXPART or SYSIBM.SYSTABLEPART. The limit key was truncated to the existing internal limit key
length to ensure the new limit key value has the same internal length as the other partitions.
System action: The specified index or table was altered but the limit key was truncated to be the existing internal
limit key length.
SQLSTATE: 01540
+738 DEFINITION CHANGE OF object object_name MAY REQUIRE SIMILAR CHANGE ON READ-ONLY SYSTEMS
Explanation: A change was made to the definition of the specified object that may also require a similar change to
any read-only shared systems.
System action: The statement is successfully executed.
Programmer response: Check the read-only shared systems that have the specified object defined, and determine if
a change must be made to the object on those systems.
SQLSTATE: 01530
+799 THE SET STATEMENT set-stmt REFERENCES A SPECIAL REGISTER THAT DOES NOT EXIST AT THE SERVER SITE
Explanation: A DB2 server received a SET statement that it does not understand.
set-stmt The SET statement that contains the unrecognized special register. This token might be blank for servers
other than DB2 for z/OS, or for downlevel DB2 for z/OS servers.
System action: The SET SPECIAL REGISTER request is ignored.
Programmer response: This SQLCODE can be returned to an application for any SQL statement. This SQLCODE
might be masked by other negative SQLCODEs that the SQL statement receives. Processing continues at the server.
SQLSTATE: 01527

+802 EXCEPTION ERROR exception-type HAS OCCURRED DURING operation-type OPERATION ON data-type DATA, POSITION position-number
Explanation: The exception error exception-type occurred while performing one of the following operations on a field
that has a data-type of DECIMAL, FLOAT, SMALLINT, or INTEGER:
v ADDITION
v SUBTRACTION
v MULTIPLICATION
v DIVISION
v NEGATION
v BUILT-IN FUNCTION
The error occurred while processing an arithmetic expression in the SELECT list of an outer SELECT statement, and
the position in the select list is denoted by position-number. The possible exception types are:
DECIMAL OVERFLOW
A decimal overflow exception can occur when one or more nonzero digits are lost because the destination
field in any decimal operation is too short to contain the result.
DIVIDE EXCEPTION
A divide exception can occur on a decimal division operation when the quotient exceeds the specified
data-field size. A zero divide exception occurs on any division by zero, except when the data type is
DECFLOAT.
EXPONENT OVERFLOW
An exponent overflow can occur when the result characteristic of any floating-point operation exceeds 127
and the result fraction is not zero, i.e. the magnitude of the result exceeds approximately 7.2E+75.
FIXED POINT OVERFLOW
A fixed point overflow can occur during any arithmetic operation on either INTEGER or SMALLINT fields.
INVALID OPERATION
OUT OF RANGE
An error might occur during while processing an input, intermediate, or final value if the value of a
parameter is out of range.
OVERFLOW
An overflow can occur during the processing of a built-in function. If the operation-type is FUNCTION, then
the error occurred while processing an input, intermediate, or final value.
SUBNORMAL
UNDERFLOW
An underflow can occur during the processing of a built-in function. If the operation-type is FUNCTION, then
the error occurred while processing an input, intermediate, or final value.
ZERO DIVIDE
The data type displayed in the message might indicate the data type of the temporary internal copy of the data. This
might differ from the actual column or literal data type due to conversions by DB2.
Attention: Parts of exception-type, data-type, operation-type, and position-number might or might not be returned in
SQLCA, depending upon when the error was detected.
System action: For each expression in error the indicator variable is set to negative two (-2) to indicate a null value
returned. The data variable is unchanged. Execution of the statement continues with all non-error columns and
expressions of the outer SELECT list being returned. If the statement is cursor controlled then the cursor will remain
open.
Programmer response: Examine the expression for which the warning occurred to see if the cause (or the likely
cause) of the problem can be determined. The problem may be data-dependent, in which case it will be necessary to
examine the data that was being processed at the time the error occurred.
See the explanation of SQLCODE -405 for allowed ranges of numeric data types.
SQLSTATE: 01519
+806 BIND ISOLATION LEVEL RR CONFLICTS WITH TABLESPACE LOCKSIZE PAGE OR LOCKSIZE ROW AND LOCKMAX 0
Explanation: The specification of isolation level RR is incompatible with the LOCKSIZE PAGE or LOCKSIZE ROW
and LOCKMAX 0 specification for a table space accessed by the application. Table space locking is used to protect
the integrity of the application.
System action: A valid package/plan is created if no errors are detected. Table space locking is used. RR isolation
level is preserved.
Programmer response: If you do not want table space locking, use isolation level UR, CS, or RS.
SQLSTATE: 01553
+807 THE RESULT OF DECIMAL MULTIPLICATION MAY CAUSE OVERFLOW
Explanation: An arithmetic expression contains a decimal multiplication that may cause an overflow condition
when the statement is executed. The problem may be corrected by restructuring the arithmetic expression so that
decimal multiplication precedes decimal division or by changing the precision and scale of the operands in the
arithmetic expression.
System action: A valid package will be created if no errors are detected.
SQLSTATE: 01554

+863 THE CONNECTION WAS SUCCESSFUL BUT ONLY SBCS WILL BE SUPPORTED
Explanation: The target AS supports only the DB2 SBCS CCSID. The DB2 Mixed CCSID or GRAPHIC CCSID or
both are not supported by the target AS. DB2 character data sent to the target AS must be restricted to SBCS.
System action: The CONNECT statement is successful. The release level of the target AS has been placed into the
SQLERRP field of the SQLCA.
Programmer response: Do not execute any SQL statements which pass either mixed data or graphic data as input
host variables.

+883 ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT OCCURRED WHEN THERE WERE OPERATIONS THAT CANNOT BE UNDONE, OR AN OPERATION THAT CANNOT BE UNDONE OCCURRED WHEN THERE WAS A SAVEPOINT OUTSTANDING
Explanation: The operations that are referred to are updates (inserts into or deletes from) a created global temporary
table. If this SQL warning code is received as the result of a ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT statement, the rollback is
performed; however, the changes that were made to the temporary table are not undone. If this SQL warning code is
received as the result of an operation to a created global temporary table, the operation is performed; however, be
advised that a savepoint is outstanding, and the update will not be backed out if a rollback to the savepoint is
performed.

+4726 THE STATEMENT WAS SUCCESSFULLY PREPARED, BUT IT CANNOT BE EXECUTED BECAUSE authorization-id DOES NOT HAVE privilege-name PRIVILEGE ON OBJECT object-name BUT HAS EXPLAIN PRIVILEGE
Explanation: During prepare, the authorization ID does not have the indicated privilege for an object but has
EXPLAIN privilege.
authorization-id
The authorization ID of the process.
object-name
The name of the object that the privilege applies to.
privilege-name
The name of the privilege required to prepare the statement.
The statement that was prepared by using the EXPLAIN privilege cannot be executed, and a cursor cannot be
opened for the statement. Only the SQL descriptor information can be obtained from the prepared statement.
The following authorities have implicit EXPLAIN privilege:
v SQLADM
v System DBADM
v SYSADM
System action: The prepared statement was not executed. No cursor was opened for the statement.
Programmer response: Ensure that no OPEN or EXECUTE statements refer to the prepared statement.

Explanation: The statement for object-name was successful, but an error occurred on the accelerator server.
object-name
The name of the object that was specified to be dropped.
reason-code
A numeric value that provides additional information about why the statement cannot be executed in the
accelerator server. Possible values are:
1. A row corresponding to the table does not exist in the SYSACCELERATEDTABLES catalog table.
2. The accelerator server is not available for one of the following reasons:
v The accelerator server has not been started.
v The accelerator server was started in EXPLAIN ONLY mode.
v The accelerator server was started in maintenance mode.
v The accelerator server accelerator does not exist.
3. A DRDA error was encountered.
System action: The object was dropped at the DB2 server. The object might not have been dropped at the associated
accelerator server.
Programmer response: Use the reason code to determine the cause of the failure, and take the appropriate action.
1. No action is needed. The table on the accelerator has already been dropped.
2. When the accelerator is available, invoke the accelerator procedure to drop the table on the accelerator.
3. The drop did not get processed on the accelerator because a connection could not be established with the
accelerator. When the accelerator is available, invoke the accelerator procedure to drop the table on the
accelerator.

Explanation: The subcommand finished successfully. However, APCOMPARE or APREUSE might not be completely
successful. This warning message is issued for remote BIND or REBIND only. One of the following conditions
occurred:
v APCOMPARE(WARN) was specified but the use of APCOMPARE resulted in some statements where comparison
is not successful or comparison could not be performed.
v APREUSE(WARN) was specified and the use of APREUSE resulted in some statements where APREUSE is either

+20002 THE specification-source SPECIFICATION IS IGNORED FOR OBJECT object-name
Explanation: An SQL statement includes a specification that was ignored.
specification-source
The source of the specification, either a clause or a bind option.
GBPCACHE clause
The GBPCACHE clause conflicts with the group buffer pool specification GBPCACHE(NO). When
the group buffer pool attribute is set to GBPCACHE(NO), the clause can contain only GBPCACHE
NONE. The clause is part of one of the following statements:
v CREATE INDEX
v ALTER INDEX
v CREATE TABLESPACE
v ALTER TABLESPACE
PADDED or NOT PADDED clause
The statement identifies an index that does not have any varying-length character or graphic
columns in the index key. The PADDED and NOT PADDED attributes do not apply in this case.
The clause is part of one of the following statements:
v CREATE INDEX
v ALTER INDEX
USE CURRENTLY COMMITTED clause
The SELECT statement identifies a table that does not support multiple XML versions. The USE
CURRENTLY COMMITTED clause requires that the table support multiple XML versions.
ACCESSCONCURRENTRESOLUTION (UseCurrentlyCommitted) bind option
The SELECT statements that are bound in this package identify one or more tables that do not
support multiple XML versions. This bind option requires that the tables support multiple XML
versions.
object-name
The name of the object.
System action: The statement is processed, but the clause is ignored.
User response: No action is required.
GBPCACHE clause
To use other GBPCACHE options (ALL, CHANGED, or SYSTEM), alter the table space or index to use a
group buffer pool that is defined with GBPCACHE(YES).
PADDED or NOT PADDED clause
To prevent future instances of this message, remove the clause from the statement.
USE CURRENTLY COMMITTED clause
To prevent future instances of this message:
v Avoid using the USE CURRENTLY COMMITTED clause to access non-versioned XML.
v Convert the table to a table that supports multiple XML versions.
ACCESSCONCURRENTRESOLUTION (UseCurrentlyCommitted)
To prevent future instances of this message:
v Avoid using this bind option for a plan or package that will access non-versioned XML.
v Convert the table to a table that supports multiple XML versions.

+20007 USE OF OPTIMIZATION HINTS IS DISALLOWED BY A DB2 SUBSYSTEM PARAMETER. THE SPECIAL REGISTER 'OPTIMIZATION HINT' IS SET TO AN EMPTY STRING.
Explanation: DB2 is not enabled to use optimization hints. The special register OPTIMIZATION HINT is set to an
empty string.
System action: The user-specified optimization hints are ignored. The access path is determined without the use of
hints and processing continues normally.
Programmer response: Enable the use of OPTIMIZATION HINT by changing the value of OPTIMIZATION HINTS
on the DB2 Installation panel DSNTIP8.
If, after further consideration, you do not want to use an OPTIMIZATION HINT, use the SET CURRENT
OPTIMIZATION HINT statement to disable the use of optimization hints.
Specify an empty string, or a string of blanks, on a SET CURRENT OPTIMIZATION HINT statement to cause DB2 to
use normal optimization techniques and ignore optimization hints.
SQLSTATE: 01602
+20122 DEFINE NO OPTION IS NOT APPLICABLE IN THE CONTEXT SPECIFIED
Explanation: The DEFINE NO option was specified, however it is not applicable in the context specified. DEFINE
NO was specified in one of the following situations:
v a CREATE INDEX statement that included the VCAT clause
v a CREATE INDEX statement for a non-empty table
v a CREATE INDEX statement on a declared temporary table
v a CREATE LOB TABLESPACE statement
v a CREATE TABLESPACE statement that included the VCAT clause
v a CREATE INDEX statement for a table that has a defined clone
System action: DB2 ignored the DEFINE NO option and created the object with the DEFINE YES option instead.
SQLSTATE: 01644
+20141 TRUNCATION OF VALUE WITH LENGTH length OCCURRED FOR hv-or-parm-number
Explanation: A value that was assigned to a host variable or parameter was truncated. However, the length of the
value that was truncated is too large to be returned in the indicator variable. This situation can occur when
truncation occurs on assignment of:
v a value to a parameter of a remote stored procedure if the value being truncated is greater than 127 bytes. In this
case, the indicator variable will contain a value of 127.
v a LOB value to a host variable if the value being truncated is greater than 32K bytes. In this case, the indicator
variable will contain a value of 32K.
In these cases, the actual length of the truncated value cannot be returned to the application that uses the indicator
variable. The actual length of the value is returned as message token length.
System action: The assignment was made, but the data was truncated.
Programmer response: Change the declaration of hv-or-parm-number to avoid truncation.
SQLSTATE: 01004
+20187 ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT CAUSED A NOT LOGGED TABLE SPACE TO BE PLACED IN THE LPL
Explanation: An application issued a ROLLBACK, but uncommitted changes existed for a table space defined with
the NOT LOGGED logging attribute. DB2 cannot undo changes made to not logged table spaces because no log
records were written due to the logging attribute of the table space. The table space is placed in the LPL so that other
concurrently running agents are not able to see the data that cannot be rolled back. The table space is also marked
recover pending because the table space has been modified.
System action: The ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT was performed, however changes that were made to not logged
table spaces have not been undone.
Programmer response: Avoid making changes to a not logged table space within the span of a savepoint to which
you intend to rollback.
To remove a table space from the LPL and reset recover pending, use one of the following options:
v REFRESH TABLE to repopulate a Materialized Query Table, but only if the Materialized Query Table is alone in its
table space. If the table, including Materialized Query Tables, is not alone in its table space, a utility must be used
to reset the table space and remove it from recover pending.
v RECOVER utility, to recover either to currency or to a prior image copy
v LOAD REPLACE utility or LOAD REPLACE PART utility:
¨C With an input data set to empty the table space and repopulate the table
¨C Without an input data set to empty the table space to prepare for one or more insert operations to repopulate
the table
v Drop and re-create the table space and repopulate the table.
v DELETE without a WHERE clause to empty the table. When the table space is segmented or universal, the table is
alone in its table space and the table does not have a VALIDPROC, referential constraints, delete Triggers, or a
SECURITY LABEL column (or has this column, but multilevel security is not in effect).
v TRUNCATE TABLE to empty the table. When the table space is segmented or universal, the table is alone in its
table space and the table does not have a VALIDPROC, referential constraints, or a SECURITY LABEL column (or
has this column, but multilevel security with row level granularity is not in effect).
Important: If the table, materialized query table or not, is not alone in its table space, a utility must be used to reset
the table space and remove it from recover pending.
SQLSTATE: 01656
+20224 ENCRYPTED DATA THAT WAS ORIGINALLY A BINARY STRING CANNOT BE DECRYPTED TO A CHARACTER STRING
Explanation: The DECRYPT_BIT, DECRYPT_CHAR, or DECRYPT_DB function was invoked with an argument that
represents an encrypted string that was originally a binary string. A binary string cannot be cast to a character string
using the DECRYPT_BIT, DECRYPT_CHAR, or DECRYPT_DB function.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: The encrypted value can only be decrypted using the DECRYPT_BINARY function.
SQLSTATE: 01658
+20237 FETCH PRIOR ROWSET FOR CURSOR cursor-name RETURNED A PARTIAL ROWSET
Explanation: A FETCH PRIOR ROWSET statement was issued, but there were not enough rows prior to the current
cursor position to reposition the cursor on a full rowset. The cursor has been positioned on a partial rowset. If a
target was specified, then data has only been returned for the number of rows that were actually fetched for the
partial rowset.
System action: The cursor is positioned on a partial rowset.
Programmer response: Analyze the situation to determine if anything should be rolled back.
SQLSTATE: 02504
+20245 NOT PADDED CLAUSE IS IGNORED FOR INDEXES CREATED ON AUXILIARY TABLES
Explanation: The NOT PADDED clause is ignored on the CREATE INDEX statement because auxiliary indexes are
always PADDED.
System action: The option is ignored; processing continues.
Programmer response: Remove the NOT PADDED clause to avoid this warning.
SQLSTATE: 01663
+20270 OPTION NOT SPECIFIED FOLLOWING ALTER PARTITION CLAUSE
Explanation: An ALTER INDEX statement, which included the ALTER PARTITION clause, did not contain an
option following the ALTER PARTITION keywords.
System action: The SQL statement is processed.
Programmer response: Specify a partition option after the ALTER PARTITION keywords to avoid this warning in
the future. For an ALTER INDEX statement, if partition-element is specified, specify either the ENDING clause of:
v partition-element
v using-block
v free-block
v gbcaches-block
SQLSTATE: 01664
+20271 THE NAME AT ORDINAL POSITION position-number IN THE STATEMENT, WITH NAME object-name, WAS TRUNCATED.
Explanation: At least one object name in the described statement was truncated. The object name was either too
long, or became too long after code page conversion.
position-number
The ordinal position number of the name that was truncated. For the describe output of a prepared query,
the ordinal position is relative to the order of columns in the select list of the query:
v For DESCRIBE TABLE, the position is relative to the order of the columns in the table definition.
v When describing the output of a CALL statement, the position is relative to the OUT or INOUT
parameters of the procedure to which the CALL resolved.
v When describing the input of a CALL statement, the position is relative to the IN or INOUT parameters of
the procedure to which the CALL resolved.
object-name
The name of the column, distinct type, or distinct type schema that was truncated.
The length of the column name, distinct type name, and user defined type schema name are limited when using the
SQLDA structure.
System action: Processing continues.
User response: If the exact name is significant, do one of the following:
v For the name of a result column that is specified in an AS clause, change the name in the AS clause so that the
result column has a shorter name.
v For the name of a column in a table or view, drop and re-create the table or view so that the column has a shorter
name, or provide a shorter name for the result column in the query with an AS clause.
v For the name of a column in a table, use the ALTER TABLE statement to rename the column so that it has a
shorter name.
SQLSTATE: 01665
+20272 TABLE SPACE table-space-name HAS BEEN CONVERTED TO USE TABLE-CONTROLLED PARTITIONING INSTEAD OF INDEX-CONTROLLED PARTITIONING, ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: old-limit-key-value
Explanation: When one of the following statements executed, table-space-name was converted to use table-controlled
partitioning instead of index-controlled partitioning:
v ALTER INDEX with the CLUSTER NO clause
v ALTER TABLE...ADD PARTITION
v ALTER TABLE...ALTER PARTITION
v ALTER TABLE...ROTATE PARTITION
v CREATE INDEX...ENDING AT without the CLUSTER clause
v CREATE PARTITIONED INDEX
v DROP INDEX for a partitioning index
If the statement was ALTER INDEX, CREATE PARTITIONED INDEX, or DROP INDEX, the last partition's old value
of old-limit-key-value was set to the highest possible value for an ascending index key column, or the lowest possible
value for a descending index key column. For all other statements, *N is returned for old-limit-key-value.
If the statement was ALTER TABLE with the ROTATE PARTITION clause, then certain partitions might be left in
REORG pending state.
System action: The statement is successfully executed. If the statement was ALTER INDEX, CREATE PARTITIONED
INDEX, or DROP INDEX, the LIMITKEY column in SYSIBM.SYSTABLEPART was set to the highest possible value
for an ascending index key column, or the lowest possible value for a descending index key column.

Explanation: The PATH value exceeded the limit of bytes that the PATH column of SYSIBM.SYSJAROBJECTS can
contain. The PATH column of SYSIBM.SYSJAROBJECTS stores only the first 2048 bytes of the value passed to
SQLJ.ALTER_JAVA_PATH.
System action: Processing continues.
User response: If you need to know the entire PATH value, query the SYSIBM.SYSJAVAPATHS table.
SQLSTATE: 01011
+20360 TRUSTED CONNECTION CAN NOT BE ESTABLISHED FOR SYSTEM AUTHID authorization-name
Explanation: A trusted connection cannot be established for authorization-name. A matching trusted context is not
currently defined. SQLWARN8 is set to indicate that a trusted connection was not established.
System action: The attempt to create a trusted connection was not successful. A normal connection is created
without any attributes of a trusted context.
Programmer response: Ensure that the trusted context has been correctly defined and try to re-establish a trusted
connection.
SQLSTATE: 01679
+20365 A SIGNALING NAN WAS ENCOUNTERED, OR AN EXCEPTION OCCURRED IN AN ARITHMETIC OPERATION OR FUNCTION INVOLVING A DECFLOAT.
Explanation: A signaling NaN (sNaN) was encountered in an expression, arithmetic operation, or function involving
a DECFLOAT column, or value resulted in an exception. In either case, the result is NAN, and a warning is issued.
System action: Execution of the statement continues. All non-error columns and expressions of the outer SELECT
list are returned. If the statement is cursor controlled, then the cursor will remain open.
User response: Examine the expression for which the warning occurred to see you can determine the cause of the
problem. The problem might be data-dependent, in which case you must examine the data that was being processed
at the time the error occurred.
SQLSTATE:: 01565
+20367 OPTION clause IS NOT SUPPORTED IN THE CONTEXT IN WHICH IT WAS SPECIFIED
Explanation: The clause in the statement is not supported in the context in which has been specified. The clause is
ignored.

Programmer response: No change is required for the current release; however, it is recommended that the statement
be modified to conform to valid SQL syntax.
SQLSTATE: 01680
+20371 THE ABILITY TO USE TRUSTED CONTEXT context-name WAS REMOVED FROM SOME, BUT NOT ALL AUTHORIZATION IDS SPECIFIED IN THE STATEMENT.
Explanation: An ALTER TRUSTED CONTEXT statement for context name contained a DROP USE FOR clause with
multiple authorization IDs or PUBLIC, but one or more authorization IDs were not defined to use the trusted
context.
System action: The statement is processed.
Programmer response: One or more users were removed from the definition of the trusted context, but one or more
other users were not previously allowed to use the trusted context.
SQLSTATE: 01682
+20378 A NON-ATOMIC statement STATEMENT SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED FOR SOME OF THE REQUESTED ROWS, POSSIBLY WITH WARNINGS, AND ONE OR MORE ERRORS, AND THE CURSOR CAN BE USED
Explanation: A non-atomic statement statement successfully processed some of the rows of data that were requested.
However, one or more error conditions occurred, and some warnings might have also occurred. Use GET
DIAGNOSTICS to obtain information about the error and warning conditions that occurred. The cursor can be used
to retrieve data for the rows that were successfully processed.
System action: One or more rows were successfully processed, but one or more errors or warnings also occurred.
Programmer response: Analyze the error and warning conditions to determine if the statement should be rolled
back.

+20468 THE COMBINATION OF TARGET NAMESPACE target-namespace AND SCHEMA LOCATION HINT location-hint IS NOT UNIQUE IN THE DB2 XML SCHEMA REPOSITORY.
Explanation: XSR_COMPLETE completed registration of an XML schema. However, the DB2 XML schema
repository already contains one or more XML schemas with the same combination of the target namespace and
schema location hint values.
target-namespace
The target namespace of the XML schema that was registered.
location-hint
The schema location hint for the XML schema that was registered.
System action: The XML schema has been successfully registered and is stored in the DB2 XML schema repository.
Programmer response: Applications that perform XML schema validation using this XML schema can refer to the
XML schema only by its schema name, and not by its target namespace and schema location hint. If there is a need
to refer to the XML schema with the target namespace and schema location hint, remove the XML schema from the
XML schema repository, and register it again with a unique combination of target namespace and schema location
hint.
SQLSTATE: 0168X
+20520 ATTEMPT TO USE A DEPRECATED FEATURE ON OBJECT object-name. REASON CODE reason-code
Explanation: The statement attempted to use a deprecated feature.
reason-code
A numeric value that identifies the deprecated feature:
1 The statement attempted use the XML schema decomposition feature. Processing continues and the
stored procedure was invoked. This situation can occur when the following stored procedures are
called:
v SYSPROC.XSR_COMPLETE with the issuedfordecomposition flag set to 1
v SYSPROC.XDBDECOMPXML
v SYSPROC.XDBDECOMPXML100MB
2 The definition of table that is indicated by object-name is created with a format that is no longer
supported by EXPLAIN. Processing continues and the EXPLAIN tables are populated as usual.
Only one instance of this message is issued per package for EXPLAIN tables in supported formats
during bind or rebind.
This condition is normal during conversion mode after migration from Version 8 if object-name is
DSN_STATEMENT_CACHE_TABLE.
object-name
When reason-code is 2, the name of the table. Otherwise, *N.
System action: Processing continues as described in the explanation.
User response: No change is required at this time. However, you should update the statement to prepare for future
releases, when an error will be returned for the same condition.
Programmer response: Change the statement for future releases. Take the action that corresponds to the reason-code
value:
1 Update your SQL statement to change any implicit or explicit reference to the XML schema decomposition
feature so that they use the XMLTABLE function for the decomposition of an XML document.
2 Either migrate the EXPLAIN tables to the current format or redefine them by dropping and re-creating them
in the required format.
This condition is normal during conversion mode after migration from Version 8 if object-name is
DSN_STATEMENT_CACHE_TABLE. After DB2 enters new-function mode, use job DSNTIJXA to alter
DSN_STATEMENT_CACHE_TABLE into Version 10 format.

-079 QUALIFIER FOR OBJECT name WAS SPECIFIED AS qualifier1 but qualifier2 IS REQUIRED
Explanation: The schema qualifier for the DB2 object must be qualifier2. The statement defines a new object named
name with an explicit schema qualifier of qualifier1. Specifying a schema qualifier other than qualifier2 is not allowed.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the statement in one of the following ways:
v Change the schema qualifier to qualifier2.
v Remove the schema qualifier, and let DB2 default it to qualifier2.
SQLSTATE: 428EK
-084 UNACCEPTABLE SQL STATEMENT
Explanation: This SQL statement is unacceptable to DB2. One of the following situations has occurred:
v An attempt has been made to PREPARE or EXECUTE IMMEDIATE an SQL statement that cannot be prepared.
v The embedded SQL statement is not an SQL statement supported by DB2.
v The statement referenced an undeclared cursor.
v An attempt was made to prepare an ALLOCATE CURSOR statement but the statement identifier is already
associated with a declared cursor.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Perform one of the following actions, depending on the situation:
v If the SQL statement cannot be prepared, the problem is in the source of the SQL statement, not the application
program. Thus, no action is necessary unless the source of the SQL statement is the application program itself.
v If the SQL statement is not supported by DB2, remove it from the application program and precompile again.
v If an attempt was made to prepare an ALLOCATE CURSOR statement, change the application program to use a
statement identifier that is not associated with a declared cursor.

-087 A NULL VALUE WAS SPECIFIED IN A CONTEXT WHERE A NULL IS NOT ALLOWED
Explanation: An SQL parameter or SQL variable having a null value was specified in a context in which a null
value is not allowed. For example, an SQL statement can be specified with an SQL parameter or SQL variable on the
PREPARE and EXECUTE statements. In these contexts the value of an SQL parameter or SQL variable must not be
null.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.

-096 VARIABLE variable-name DOES NOT EXIST OR IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE SERVER AND A DEFAULT VALUE WAS NOT PROVIDED
Explanation: The GETVARIABLE function was invoked for variable variable-name. However, a value does not exist
for a variable with that name, and a default value was not provided.
v If the qualifier is SESSION, a user-defined variable with name variable-name has not been set.
v If the qualifier is SYSIBM, the server does not support a built-in session variable with name variable-name.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the invocation of the function to specify a default value for variable-name, or change
the name of to a variable that is supported at the server.
SQLSTATE: 42704
-097 THE USE OF LONG VARCHAR OR LONG VARGRAPHIC IS NOT ALLOWED IN THIS CONTEXT
Explanation: The statement attempted to use the LONG VARCHAR or LONG VARGRAPHIC syntax. This syntax
cannot be used for the following statements:
v CAST specification syntax
v CREATE DISTINCT TYPE
v CREATE FUNCTION
v CREATE PROCEDURE
v ALTER FUNCTION
v COMMENT ON FUNCTION
v GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION
v REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION
v DROP
Use the VARCHAR or VARGRAPHIC syntax specifying an explicit length as required.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the statement.
SQLSTATE: 42601
-101 THE STATEMENT IS TOO LONG OR TOO COMPLEX
Explanation: DB2 cannot process the statement because it exceeds the system limits for length or complexity.
Enabling parallelism will increase the complexity of the statement.
System action: DB2 cannot process the statement.
Programmer response: Divide the statement into shorter or less complex SQL statements.
If the statement enables parallelism, try disabling parallelism. You may do this by using the DEGREE(1) bind option
for static SQL, or by setting the CURRENT DEGREE special register to '1' for dynamic SQL.
SQLSTATE: 54001
-102 STRING CONSTANT IS TOO LONG. STRING BEGINS string
Explanation: The string constant beginning with string has a length greater than the maximum allowed length. Most
strings have these limits:
v For a hexadecimal constant (X, GX, or UX), the number of hexadecimal digits must not exceed 32704.
v Any other character string constant must be short enough so that its UTF-8 representation requires no more than 32704 bytes.
v Any other graphic string constant must be short enough so that its UTF-8 representation requires no more than 32704 bytes.
v The sum of the lengths of the UTF-8 representations of the constant values in an ENDING AT clause must not
exceed 765 bytes. This clause applies to CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, CREATE INDEX, or ALTER INDEX.
In some contexts, however, the limit is smaller.
For special registers, the allowable length depends on the particular special register. A string that exceeds the limit
can be specified only through assignment from a host variable.
Two consecutive string delimiters are used to represent one string delimiter within the character string, but these
count as 2 bytes when calculating the lengths of character string constants.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: The requested function is not available interactively. If the error occurred in the context of an
SQL statement embedded in an application program, assign the long string to a host variable, and substitute that
variable for the string constant in the SQL statement.

-103 constant IS AN INVALID NUMERIC CONSTANT
Explanation: The indicated constant begins with a digit, but is not a valid integer, decimal, decimal floating point, or
float constant.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the invalid constant.
SQLSTATE: 42604
-104 ILLEGAL SYMBOL "token". SOME SYMBOLS THAT MIGHT BE LEGAL ARE: token-list
Explanation: A syntax error was detected where the symbol "token" occurs in the SQL statement. The list of symbols
that might be legal shows some alternate symbols that could possibly be correct at that point, if the preceding part of
the statement is entirely correct.
However, the preceding part of the statement might be incorrect. For example, if an important keyword is omitted,
DB2 detects the error later, and not always immediately after the point where the keyword should appear. The list of
alternate symbols are only suggestions. Some of those symbols might not even be legal for statements to be executed
by DB2. Those symbols are possibly correct for statements sent to other database management systems.
This SQLCODE will also be issued if the ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT statement is specified without a savepoint
name.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the statement and execute it again.
SQLSTATE: 42601
-105 INVALID STRING
Explanation: The statement contains an invalid string. It is neither a character string nor a graphic string.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Specify the correct format of the string. Check for a graphic string, paired delimiters, the
character G or N, and an even number of bytes within the string.
SQLSTATE: 42604
-107 THE NAME name-value IS TOO LONG. MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE SIZE IS maximum-size
Explanation: The name name-value is too long. The maximum permissible length for names of that type is indicated
by maximum-size.
For an SQL version ID, the name must not exceed 64 EBCDIC bytes, or 122 UTF-8 bytes.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Choose a shorter name for the object.

System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the use of the aggregate function to eliminate the invalid expression and reissue the
statement.

-113 INVALID CHARACTER FOUND IN: string, REASON CODE nnn
Explanation: The string contains an invalid character. It can be an SQL ordinary identifier name, a host variable
name, or a DBCS comment.
Certain SQL identifiers (for example names of buffer pools, databases, and plans) must contain only uppercase
alphabetic or national characters and numerics; the first character must be alphabetic or national.
The following reason codes apply to SBCS identifiers:
 000 An invalid character was found in the SBCS identifier (including the case in which a DBCS identifier was used where only an SBCS identifier is allowed.) The following reason codes apply to DBCS identifiers or comments:
 101 An odd number of bytes exists between the shift-out and the shift-in character.
 102 Either a shift-in or shift-out character is missing.
 103 DBCS blanks X'4040' are not allowed.
 104 There are no characters between the shift-out and the shift-in characters.
 105 Shift-out cannot be the first byte of the DBCS character between the shift-out and the shift-in characters.  
System action: Processing is terminated.  
User response: Correct the name.
SQLSTATE: 42602
-114 THE LOCATION NAME location DOES NOT MATCH THE CURRENT SERVER
Explanation: A 3-part SQL procedure name was provided for one of the following SQL statements:
ASSOCIATE LOCATORS
CALL
DESCRIBE PROCEDURE
The first part of the SQL procedure name, which specifies the location where the stored procedure resides, did not
match the value of the SQL CURRENT SERVER special register.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Take one of these actions to resolve the mismatch:
v Change the location qualifier to match the CURRENT SERVER special register.
v Issue an SQL CONNECT to the location where the stored procedure resides before issuing the SQL statement.
Ensure that the SQL CALL statement is issued before the ASSOCIATE LOCATORS or DESCRIBE PROCEDURE.
v Bind the package containing the 3-part SQL procedure name with the BIND option DBPROTOCOL(DRDA). With
this option, DB2 implicitly uses the DRDA protocol for remote access to the stored procedure.
v Correct the statements so that the exact syntax used to specify the procedure name on the CALL statement be the
same as that on the ASSOCIATE LOCATOR and/or DESCRIBE PROCEDURE. If an unqualified name is used to
CALL the procedure, the 1-part name must also be used on the other statements. If the CALL statement is made
with a 3-part name, and the current server is the same as the location in the 3-part name, the ASSOCIATE
LOCATOR or DESCRIBE procedure can omit the location.
SQLSTATE: 42961
-115 A PREDICATE IS INVALID BECAUSE THE COMPARISON OPERATOR operator IS FOLLOWED BY A PARENTHESIZED LIST OR BY ANY OR ALL WITHOUT A SUBQUERY
Explanation: A simple comparison like '>' must not be followed by a list of items. ANY and ALL comparisons must
be followed by a subselect, rather than an expression or a list of items.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the SQL statement.

-117 THE NUMBER OF VALUES ASSIGNED IS NOT THE SAME AS THE NUMBER OF SPECIFIED OR IMPLIED COLUMNS
Explanation: The number of insert values in the value list of the insert operation is not the same as the number of
object columns specified. Alternatively, the number of values on the right side of an assignment in a SET assignment
statement or the SET clause of an update operation does not match the number of columns on the left side.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No data was inserted into the object table.
Programmer response: Correct the statement to specify one and only one value for each of the specified object
columns.
SQLSTATE: 42802
-118 THE OBJECT TABLE OR VIEW OF THE DELETE OR UPDATE STATEMENT IS ALSO IDENTIFIED IN A FROM CLAUSE
Explanation: The table or view specified as the object of a DELETE or UPDATE statement also appears in the
FROM clause of a subselect within the statement.
The table or view that is the object of a UPDATE or DELETE cannot also be used to supply the values to be inserted
or to qualify the rows to be updated or deleted.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No data was updated or deleted.
Programmer response: Create a temporary copy of the object table or view, and perform the subselect on that copy.

-119 A COLUMN OR EXPRESSION IN A HAVING CLAUSE IS NOT VALID
Explanation: A column or expression identified in a HAVING clause, possibly within a scalar function, does not
appear in the GROUP BY clause. Columns or expressions specified in a HAVING clause must appear within
aggregate functions or also be specified in the GROUP BY clause.
Grouping expressions can be used in a search condition in a HAVING clause. A grouping expression specifies only
one value for each group. A grouping expression specified in this context must exactly match a grouping expression
specified in the GROUP BY clause, with the exception of blanks, which are not significant.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: The implied function is not supported by DB2.

-120 AN AGGREGATE FUNCTION OR OLAP SPECIFICATION IS NOT VALID IN THE CONTEXT IN WHICH IT WAS INVOKED
Explanation: An aggregate function, a user-defined function that is sourced on an aggregate function, or an OLAP
specification is not permitted in the following contexts:
v In a SET clause.
v In a VALUES clause.
v In a SET transition-variable statement.
v In an assignment statement.
v In the key-expression of an index definition.
v In the expression of a RETURN statement.
An aggregate function or an OLAP specification can only be specified in a WHERE clause if the WHERE clause
appears within a subquery of a HAVING clause.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the statement so that the aggregate function or OLAP specification is not specified in
a context where it is not allowed.

-121 THE COLUMN name IS IDENTIFIED MORE THAN ONCE IN THE INSERT OR UPDATE OPERATION OR SET TRANSITION VARIABLE STATEMENT
Explanation: The same column name is specified more than once, either in the list of object columns of an insert
operation, in the SET clause of an update operation, or in a SET transition variable statement.
name The name of the column.
This error can also occur during an update or insert operation on a view, when one column of the view is based on
the same column of a base table.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No data was inserted or updated in the object table.
Programmer response: Correct the syntax of the statement so that each column name is specified only once.
SQLSTATE: 42701
-122 COLUMN OR EXPRESSION IN THE SELECT LIST IS NOT VALID
Explanation: The SELECT statement contains one of these errors:
v The statement contains a column name and an aggregate function in the SELECT clause, but no GROUP BY clause.
v A column name is contained in the SELECT clause (possibly within a scalar function) but not in the GROUP BY
clause. Grouping expressions can be used in a SELECT list. A grouping expression specifies only one value for
each group. A grouping expression that is specified in this context must exactly match a grouping expression that
is specified in the GROUP BY clause, except that blanks are not significant.
Attention: A HAVING clause specified without a GROUP BY clause implies a GROUP BY with no columns.
Thus, no column names are allowed in the SELECT clause.
v An expression is specified in the SELECT clause but not in the GROUP BY clause.
v A sort-key-expression was specified in the ORDER BY clause, the result table contains grouped data, but the
select-clause and ORDER BY clause contain a mixture of grouped data and non-grouped data. Grouping expressions
can be used in a sort-key-expression of an ORDER BY clause. A grouping expression specifies only one value for
each group. A grouping expression that is specified in this context must exactly match a grouping expression that
is specified in the GROUP BY clause, except that blanks are not significant.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: You can correct the statement by:
v Including the columns or expressions in the GROUP BY clause that are in the SELECT clause, or
v Removing the columns or expressions from the SELECT clause.

Explanation: The parameter in position n in the function name is not a constant when it is required to be a constant
or a keyword when it is required to be a keyword.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Action: Ensure that each argument of the function conforms to the definition of the
corresponding parameter.
SQLSTATE: 42601
-125 AN INTEGER IN THE ORDER BY CLAUSE DOES NOT IDENTIFY A COLUMN OF THE RESULT
Explanation: The ORDER BY clause in the statement contains a column number that is either less than one, or
greater than the number of columns of the result table (the number of items in the SELECT clause).
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the syntax of the ORDER BY clause such that each column identifier properly
denotes a column of the result table.
SQLSTATE: 42805
-126 THE SELECT STATEMENT CONTAINS BOTH AN UPDATE CLAUSE AND AN ORDER BY CLAUSE
Explanation: The SELECT statement in the declaration for a cursor contains both an UPDATE clause and an ORDER
BY clause. Unless you use a static sensitive scrollable cursor, an ORDER BY clause cannot be specified in the
declaration for a cursor that is to be used for UPDATE.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The cursor remains undefined in the application program.
Programmer response: The implied function is not supported by DB2. A cursor that is to be used for update cannot
be defined to fetch the rows of the object table in a specific order.

Explanation: A subselect (including all subqueries) can have a maximum of 225 references to table names.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Break the SQL statement into two or more simpler statements with less than 225 table
references in each. The count will include the number of base table occurrences from each table or view on the
FROM list.

-130 THE ESCAPE CLAUSE CONSISTS OF MORE THAN ONE CHARACTER, OR THE STRING PATTERN CONTAINS AN INVALID OCCURRENCE OF THE ESCAPE CHARACTER
Explanation: The ESCAPE character must be a single character, either SBCS or DBCS as appropriate. For
'column-name LIKE pattern', the ESCAPE character can only appear in the character string if it is followed by itself,
%, or _ (underscore). The Escape Clause cannot be specified if the column name at the left of the LIKE or NOT LIKE
has the MIXED subtype.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the string pattern, or choose a different ESCAPE character and change the pattern
accordingly, or eliminate the use of the Escape Clause on the LIKE or NOT LIKE predicate where the column name
to the left has the MIXED subtype.
SQLSTATE: 22019 if other than invalid ESCAPE pattern. 22025 if invalid ESCAPE pattern.
-131 STATEMENT WITH LIKE PREDICATE HAS INCOMPATIBLE DATA TYPES
Explanation: If the column name at the left of LIKE or NOT LIKE is of type character, the expression at the right
and the ESCAPE character must be of type character. If the column name is of type graphic, the expression at the
right and the ESCAPE character must be of type graphic. If the column data type is binary string, the expression on
the right and the ESCAPE character must be binary strings.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Check the data type of every operand.
SQLSTATE: 42818
-132 AN OPERAND OF value IS NOT VALID
Explanation: The operation value can be the LIKE predicate, the ESCAPE clause, the LOCATE scalar function, the
LOCATE_IN_STRING scalar function, the POSITION scalar function, or the POSSTR scalar function. The operand or
argument of value was not valid for one of the following reasons:
v The match-expression operand of a LIKE or NOT LIKE predicate must be a string expression.
v The pattern-expression operand of the LIKE or NOT LIKE predicate, or search-string argument of the LOCATE,
LOCATE_IN_STRING, POSITION, or POSSTR function must be a string expression that can be specified by any
one of the following:
¨C A constant
¨C A special register
¨C A host variable (including a LOB locator variable)
¨C A scalar function whose arguments are any of the above (though nested function invocations cannot be used)
¨C A CAST specification whose arguments are any of the above
¨C An expression that concatenates (using CONCAT or ||) any of the above
v The source-string argument of the LOCATE, LOCATE_IN_STRING, POSITION, or POSSTR function must be a
string expression that can be specified by any of the following:
¨C A constant
¨C A special register
¨C A host variable (including a LOB locator variable)
¨C A scalar function whose arguments are any of the above (though nested function invocations cannot be used)
¨C A CAST specification whose arguments are any of the above
¨C A column name
¨C An expression that concatenates (using CONCAT or ||) any of the above
v The escape-expression operand of the LIKE or NOT LIKE predicate must be a string expression that can be
specified by any of the following:
¨C A constant
¨C A host variable (including a LOB locator variable)
¨C A scalar function whose arguments are any of the above (though nested function invocations cannot be used)
¨C A CAST specification whose arguments are any of the above
A LIKE predicate, ESCAPE clause, LOCATE scalar function, LOCATE_IN_STRING scalar function, POSITION scalar
function, or POSSTR scalar function cannot be used with DATE, TIME, or TIMESTAMP.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Check and correct the syntax of the LIKE predicate, or LOCATE, LOCATE_IN_STRING,
POSITION, or POSSTR scalar function.

-133 AN AGGREGATE FUNCTION IN A SUBQUERY OF A HAVING CLAUSE IS INVALID BECAUSE ALL COLUMN REFERENCES IN ITS ARGUMENT ARE NOT CORRELATED TO THE GROUP BY RESULT THAT THE HAVING CLAUSE IS APPLIED TO
Explanation: If an aggregate function has a correlated column reference, it must be correlated from within a
HAVING clause to the GROUP BY result that the HAVING clause is applied to. All column references in the
argument must satisfy this condition.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.

-134 IMPROPER USE OF A STRING, LOB, OR XML VALUE
Explanation: The SQL statement references a string, LOB, or XML value that is not valid in the context that was
specified.
This error can be issued when the length attribute of a string value is too long for the context in which it is used. The
string value that you specified is invalid for one of the following reasons:
v A string value with a length attribute greater than 255 bytes is not allowed in a SELECT list that also specifies
DISTINCT.
v A string value with a length attribute greater than 255 bytes is not allowed for a string representation of a number.
v A string value with a length attribute greater than 16000 bytes is not allowed for a sort operation such as an
ORDER BY clause.
v A string value with a length attribute greater than 32704 bytes is not allowed as an argument to the REPLACE
function.
This error can also be issued when LOB or XML values are specified in a context in which they are not allowed. The
LOB or XML value that you specified is invalid for one of the following reasons:
v A LOB or an XML value is not allowed in an ORDER BY clause.
v A LOB or an XML value is not allowed in a check constraint.
A token might be returned with the name of the column or special register that resulted in the error. The nature of
the error and the syntax in which it occurred determines whether a token is returned.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: DB2 does not support the requested operation on the string, LOB, or XML value.

-136 SORT CANNOT BE EXECUTED BECAUSE THE SORT KEY LENGTH TOO LONG
Explanation: A sort key is derived from the list of columns specified following a DISTINCT keyword, or in an
ORDER BY or GROUP BY clause in a query. If both a DISTINCT keyword and an ORDER BY or GROUP BY clause
are present, the sort key is derived from the combination of both lists of columns.
The internal length of the sort key cannot exceed 16000 bytes. In attempting to process the SQL statement, the
internal length of the sort key derived from the DISTINCT and ORDER BY (or GROUP BY), or, the DISTINCT or
ORDER BY (or GROUP BY) specifications was found to exceed that maximum limit.
The error can also occur for an ORDER BY specification for the XMLAGG function. The internal length of the sort
key for XMLAGG cannot exceed 4000 bytes. In attempting to process the XMLAGG function invocation, the internal
length of the sort key derived from the ORDER BY specification was found to exceed that maximum limit.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: The statement must be modified such that the internal length of the sort key does not exceed the
maximum limit. In general, this means that one or more column names must be deleted from the ORDER BY or
GROUP BY clause, or deleted from the list following the DISTINCT keyword.
SQLSTATE: 54005
-137 THE LENGTH RESULTING FROM operation IS GREATER THAN maximum-length
Explanation: The length of the result of concatenation or a function exceeds the defined maximum. The operation
that resulted in the error is operation.
v For concatenation, the length cannot exceed 32,764 (if character operands) or 16,382 (if graphic operands).
v For other functions, check the maximum result length.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Ensure that the length of the result does not exceed the defined maximum.
SQLSTATE: 54006

-138 THE SECOND OR THIRD ARGUMENT OF THE SUBSTR OR SUBSTRING FUNCTION IS OUT OF RANGE
Explanation: One of the following conditions exists:
v The value of the second argument of the SUBSTR or SUBSTRING function is less than 1 or greater than M.
v The value of the third argument of the SUBSTR or SUBSTRING function is an integer constant 0 or greater than
M-N+1.
M is the length of the first argument if it is of fixed-length, or, M is the maximum length of the first argument if it is
of varying-length. N is the value of the second argument.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Ensure that the second and third arguments of the SUBSTR or SUBSTRING function have
legal values according the rules listed in the Explanation.
SQLSTATE: 22011
-142 THE SQL STATEMENT IS NOT SUPPORTED
Explanation: An SQL statement was detected that is not supported by the database. The statement might be valid
for other IBM relational database products or it might be valid in another context. For example, statements such as
VALUES and SIGNAL or RESIGNAL SQLSTATE can be used only in certain contexts, such as in a trigger body or in
an SQL Procedure.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the syntax of the SQL statement or remove the statement from the program.
SQLSTATE: 42612
-144 INVALID SECTION NUMBER number
Explanation: One of the following:
v The user attempted to execute an invalid section.
v This release of DB2 does not support the SQL statement.
v The section number in the call parameter list is one of these:
¨C Negative
¨C An invalid duplicate
¨C Greater than the maximum section number of the DBRM or package
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: For case 1: If you are executing a package that was bound with SQLERROR(CONTINUE),
determine whether the statement in question was bound as a valid section. You can use the following statements to
query the DB2 catalog:
SELECT SQLERROR
FROM SYSIBM.SYSPACKAGE
WHERE COLLID = collection-id AND
NAME = package-id AND
VERSION = version-name;
If that query returns 'C', the package was bound with SQLERROR(CONTINUE).
SELECT STMTNO, TEXT
FROM SYSIBM.SYSPACKSTMT
WHERE COLLID = collection-id AND
NAME = package-id AND
VERSION = version-name AND
SECTNO = number AND
BINDERROR = ¡¯Y¡¯;
If that query returns any rows, the section is invalid. Refer to the error messages issued during the bind to determine
the cause. Correct any errors and bind the package again, using the REPLACE option.
For case 2: If the DB2 system has fallen back to a previous release, determine whether there are any SQL statements
with a section number of zero that are not supported by that release. You can use the following statements to query
the DB2 catalog.
When executing from a DBRM, use:
SELECT *
FROM SYSIBM.SYSSTMT
WHERE SECTNO = 0
ORDER BY NAME, PLNAME, STMTNO, SEQNO;
When executing from a package, use:
SELECT *
FROM SYSIBM.SYSPACKSTMT
WHERE SECTNO = 0
ORDER BY COLLID, NAME, VERSION, STMTNO, SEQNO;
For case 3: Examine the application to determine whether the call parameter list was changed in some way. In
general, you should not attempt to change the output of the precompiler.
SQLSTATE: 58003
-147 ALTER FUNCTION function-name FAILED BECAUSE SOURCE FUNCTIONS OR SPATIAL FUNCTIONS CANNOT BE ALTERED
Explanation: The function cannot be altered because it is a source function or a spatial function. Only fenced
external scalar functions, or fenced external table functions can be altered.
To change an existing source function or spatial function, you must DROP the function and re-create it.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the statement to refer to a function that can be altered, or re-create the function by
dropping it and then creating a new version of it.
SQLSTATE: 42809
-148 THE SOURCE TABLE OR TABLESPACE source-name CANNOT BE ALTERED, REASON reason-code
Explanation: The ALTER statement issued could not be processed.
source-name
The name of the source table or table space.
reason-code
A numeric value that indicates the reason for the failure.
01 The ALTER statement specified an ALTER COLUMN clause that attempted to drop the default
value, alter the default value, or change the length of the column. The column cannot be altered
because the column has a field procedure or is involved in a referential or check constraint. The
default value cannot be changed because the column has a field procedure.
02 The ALTER statement specified an ALTER COLUMN clause that attempted to drop the default
value, alter the default value, or change the length of the column. The column cannot be altered
because the table that is identified by source-name might be one of the following:
v A table that has an edit procedure or validation procedure.
03 The ALTER statement specified an ALTER COLUMN clause that attempted to drop the default
value, alter the default value, or alter the data type of the column. The column cannot be altered
because the table is defined with DATA CAPTURE CHANGES and the subsystem parameter
RESTRICT_ALT_COL_FOR_DCC is set to YES.
04 The ALTER statement cannot be used to define a clone table because a clone table is already
defined for source-name.
05 The ALTER statement cannot be used to define a clone table because table source-name is not in a
universal table space.
06 The ALTER statement cannot be used to define a clone table because table source-name is involved
in a referential or check constraint.
07 The ALTER statement cannot be used to define a clone table because table source-name has an after
trigger defined on it.
08 The ALTER statement cannot be used to define a clone table because table source-name is a
materialized query table.
09 The ALTER statement cannot be used to define a clone table because table source-name has active
versioning.
10 Either of the following reasons:
The ALTER statement cannot be used to define a clone table because table space of table
source-name or an index on table source-name was created with DEFINE NO, and the data set is not
yet defined.
An auxiliary object for a source table with a LOB or XML column was created with DEFINE NO,
and the data set is not yet defined
11 The ALTER statement attempted to change a table that has a defined clone, or a table that is a
clone.
12 The ALTER statement cannot be used to define a clone table because table source-name is defined
with an edit procedure, validation procedure, or field procedure.
13 The ALTER statement cannot be processed because an index exceeds versioning limit of 16.
14 An ALTER statement with an ALTER COLUMN clause attempted to change the data type from
character FOR BIT DATA to BINARY, but the cast default value length exceeds 1536 UTF-8 bytes.
15 The ALTER statement cannot be processed because no pending changes are associated with the
table space.
16 An ALTER TABLESPACE statement cannot include the MEMBER CLUSTER YES option for
hash-organized table space.
17 The ALTER statement cannot be used to define a clone table because table source-name is
hash-organized.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change source-name to the name of an object that can be altered as specified and reissue the
statement, or take an appropriate action for the reason-code value:
01 Do not attempt to change source-name to the name of an object that can be altered as specified and reissue
the statement.
02 Do not attempt to change a column that is defined with an edit procedure or valid procedure.
03 Do not attempt to change or drop the default value, or change the data type of a column when the table is
defined with DATA CAPTURE CHANGES and the subsystem parameter RESTRICT_ALT_COL_FOR_DCC is
set to YES.
04 Before defining a clone table, verify that there is no clone table already defined for source-name.
05 Before defining a clone table, verify that table source-name is in a universal table space.
06 Before defining a clone table, verify that table source-name is not involved in a referential or check constraint.
07 Before defining a clone table, verify that table source-name does not have any AFTER triggers defined on it.
08 Before defining a clone table, verify that table source-name is not a materialized query table.
09 Before defining a clone table, verify that table source-name does not have active versioning.
10 Before defining a clone table, verify that the data sets for source-name and its indexes are defined.
11 Drop the clone table, then alter the column. Use an ALTER TABLE statement with the DROP CLONE clause.
12 Before defining a clone table, verify that table source-name does not have an edit procedure, valid procedure,
or field procedure.
13 Reduce the number of versions for the index, then issue the ALTER statement again.
14 Either reduce or drop the default value. To alter the default value, use an ALTER TABLE statement with
ALTER COLUMN SET DEFAULT. To drop the default value, use an ALTER TABLE statement with ALTER
COLUMN DROP DEFAULT.
15 Avoid altering a table space to drop the pending changes that do not exist.
16 Do not attempt to add the MEMBER CLUSTER YES option for a hash-organized table space.
17 Do not attempt to define a clone table for a hash-organized table.

-150 THE OBJECT OF THE INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, MERGE, OR TRUNCATE STATEMENT IS A VIEW, SYSTEM-MAINTAINED MATERIALIZED QUERY TABLE, OR TRANSITION TABLE FOR WHICH THE REQUESTED OPERATION IS NOT PERMITTED
Explanation: One of the following occurred:
v A transition table was named in an INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, or TRUNCATE statement in a triggered
action. Transition tables are read-only.
v The view named in the INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, or TRUNCATE statement is defined in such a way
that the requested insert, update, delete, or truncate operation cannot be performed upon it.
Inserts into a view are prohibited if:
¨C The view definition contains a join, a GROUP BY, or a HAVING clause.
¨C The SELECT clause in the view definition contains the DISTINCT qualifier, an arithmetic expression, a string
expression, a built-in function, or a constant.
¨C Two or more columns of the view are derived from the same column.
¨C A base table of the view contains a column that does not have a default value and is not included in the view.
Updates to a view are prohibited if:
¨C The view definition contains a join, a GROUP BY, or a HAVING clause.
¨C The SELECT clause in the view definition contains the DISTINCT qualifier or a built-in function.
Also, a given column in a view cannot be updated (that is, the values in that column cannot be updated) if the
column is derived from an arithmetic expression, a constant, a column that is part of the key of a partitioned
index, or a column of a catalog table that cannot be updated.
Deletes against a view are prohibited if:
¨C The view definition contains a join, a GROUP BY, or a HAVING clause.
¨C The SELECT clause in the view definition contains the DISTINCT qualifier or a built-in function.
Truncates against a view are always prohibited.
v An auxiliary table or an XML table was named in a TRUNCATE statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No data was inserted, updated, deleted, merged, or truncated.
User response: The requested function cannot be performed on the view.
If the error occurred on a CREATE TRIGGER statement, remove the INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, or DELETE
reference to the transition table.

-151 THE UPDATE OPERATION IS INVALID BECAUSE THE CATALOG DESCRIPTION OF COLUMN column-name INDICATES THAT IT CANNOT BE UPDATED
Explanation: The requested function is not supported by DB2.
column-name
The name of the column that could not be updated.
This error occurs if either:
v The object column in an update operation is defined with the GENERATED ALWAYS and AS IDENTITY or AS
ROW CHANGE TIMESTAMP attributes, its value is not being set with the DEFAULT keyword, and one of the
following conditions is true:
¨C Extended indicator variable values are not enabled.
¨C Extended indicator variable values are enabled, but the value specified for the indicator variable is not the
extended indicator variable-based values of DEFAULT or UNASSIGNED.
v The object column is not updatable.
A column is not updatable for one or more of the following reasons:
v The values for columns occurring in the partitioning key of a partitioned table cannot be updated.
v The object table is a view and the specified column is defined (in the definition of the view) in such a way that it
cannot be updated.
v The object table is a catalog table with no columns that can be updated.
v The object column is a ROWID column.
v The specified column of catalog tables cannot be updated because the column itself is not updatable.
v The values for columns occurring in the hash key of a table that is organized by hash cannot be updated.
v The BUSINESS_TIME period in the table includes a column that was specified to be updated. A column of a
BUSINESS_TIME period must not be modified within a trigger body.
v The BUSINESS_TIME period in the table includes a column that was specified to be updated. A column of a
BUSINESS_TIME period must not be modified if the data change statement includes a period clause.
Individual columns in a view cannot be updated for one of the following reasons:
v The column is derived from an SQL function, an arithmetic expression, or a constant.
v The column is defined for a column of an underlying view that cannot be updated.
v The column is defined for a read-only view.
v The column is defined for a column that is in the partitioning key of a partitioned table.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No data was updated in the object table or view.
Programmer response: Correct the syntax and reissue the statement that included the update operation.

-152 THE DROP clause CLAUSE IN THE ALTER STATEMENT IS INVALID BECAUSE constraint-name IS A constraint-type
Explanation: The DROP clause of an ALTER TABLE statement tried to drop a constraint that does not match the
constraint-type in the DROP clause. clause must identify an appropriate constraint-type as follows:
REFERENTIAL CONSTRAINT
The identified constraint must be a referential constraint.
CHECK CONSTRAINT
The identified constraint must be a check constraint.
PRIMARY KEY CONSTRAINT
The identified constraint must be a primary key constraint.
UNIQUE KEY CONSTRAINT
The identified constraint must be a unique key constraint.
System action: The ALTER TABLE DROP statement cannot be executed. No object was dropped.
Programmer response: Drop the existing object with the correct DROP clause of the ALTER TABLE statement.
SQLSTATE: 42809
-153 THE STATEMENT IS INVALID BECAUSE THE VIEW OR TABLE DEFINITION DOES NOT INCLUDE A UNIQUE NAME FOR EACH COLUMN
Explanation: You must specify a list of column names if the result table of the fullselect that is specified in the
CREATE VIEW, CREATE TABLE, or DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE statement has duplicate column
names or an unnamed column (a column from a constant, function, or expression).
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The specified view or table was not created, or the declared
temporary table was not declared.
Programmer response: Correct the statement by providing a list of names for the columns of the view or table.

v ALTER TABLE
v CREATE INDEX
v CREATE MASK
v CREATE PERMISSION
v CREATE TRIGGER
v DROP TABLE
v LOCK TABLE
Indexes and triggers can be defined only on tables.

System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the statement to specify a table name in the foreign key clause.
SQLSTATE: 42810
-158 THE NUMBER OF COLUMNS SPECIFIED FOR name IS NOT THE SAME AS THE NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN THE RESULT TABLE.
Explanation: One of the following situations has occurred:
v The number of column names that are specified for a view in a CREATE VIEW statement is not the same as the
number of elements that are specified in the SELECT clauses of the fullselect that follows. These elements might be
column names, SQL functions, and expressions, for example.
v The number of column names that are specified for a table in a CREATE TABLE statement is not the same as the
number of columns in the result table of the fullselect that follows.
v The number of column names that are specified in a correlation clause is not the same as the number of columns
in the corresponding table, view, table expression, table function, or data change table reference.
v The number of columns that are specified in the RETURNS TABLE clause of a user defined table function is not
the same as the number of elements that are specified in the fullselect in the RETURN statement. The fullselect can
return zero or more rows with one or more columns. The number of columns in the fullselect must match the
number of columns in the function result.
v The number of column names that are specified in a column list of a common table expression is not the same as
the number of elements specified in the fullselect.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Specify a column name for each column in the result, and try the request again.

-159 THE STATEMENT REFERENCES object-name WHICH IDENTIFIES AN actual-type RATHER THAN AN expected-type
Explanation: An object was specified as part of a statement, but the actual type of the object is not the expected
type. For example, if the statement is DROP ALIAS TED.T1, then TED.T1 must be an alias name.
object-name
The name of the object.
actual-type
The current type of the object.
expected-type
The expected type of the object.
If actual-type or expected-type is TABLE, and actual-type or expected-type is a particular type of table, then the type of
table was not valid for the statement that was specified.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the statement to match the type of object that is identified by the expected-type value.
For example:
v An ALTER VIEW statement must reference an existing view.
v A COMMENT ON ALIAS statement must specify the name of an alias, and not the name of a table or view.
v A COMMENT ON TABLE statement must reference an existing table or view.
v A CREATE INDEX statement with the UNIQUE keyword must specify a table that is not a materialized query
table.
v A CREATE INDEX statement must specify the name of a table that is not a clone table.
v A CREATE TRIGGER statement must specify a table in the ON clause that is not a materialized query table. That
is, a trigger cannot be defined for a materialized query table.
v A CREATE TRIGGER statement must specify the name of a table that is not a clone table.
v A DROP ALIAS statement must specify the name of an alias, and not the name of a table or view.
v A DROP TABLE statement must reference an existing table. If an alias is specified, then the table that the alias
refers to is dropped. Use the DROP ALIAS statement to drop the alias.
v A DROP VIEW statement must reference an existing view.
v A REFRESH TABLE statement must refer to a materialized query table.
v A CREATE MASK or CREATE PERMISSION statement must name a base table that exists on the server. The table
must not be a system-period temporal table, a history table, or an accelerator-only table.
v The table-locator-reference must reference a table name in the LIKE clause.
SQLSTATE: 42809
-160 THE WITH CHECK OPTION CLAUSE IS NOT VALID FOR THE SPECIFIED VIEW
Explanation: The WITH CHECK OPTION clause does not apply to a view definition under the following
circumstances:
v The view is read-only (for example, the view definition includes DISTINCT GROUP BY, or JOIN).
v The view definition includes a subquery.
v A view on which the specified view definition is dependent has an INSTEAD OF trigger defined.
v The view definition references a table for which row or column access control is activated.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The specified view was not created.
Programmer response: Correct the syntax of the WITH CHECK OPTION keyword in the CREATE VIEW statement.
SQLSTATE: 42813
Related reference:
CREATE VIEW (DB2 SQL)

-161 THE INSERT OR UPDATE IS NOT ALLOWED BECAUSE A RESULTING ROW DOES NOT SATISFY THE VIEW DEFINITION
Explanation: The WITH CHECK OPTION applies to the view that is the object of the insert or update operation.
Consequently, all attempts to insert or update rows in that view are checked to ensure that the results will conform
to the view definition.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No inserts or updates were performed, and the contents of the
object view (and underlying base table) remain unchanged.
Programmer response: Examine the view definition to determine why the requested insert or update operation was
rejected. Note that this may be a data-dependent condition.
SQLSTATE: 44000
-164 authorization-id DOES NOT HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO CREATE A VIEW WITH QUALIFICATION qualifier-name
Explanation: An attempt was made to create a view, but the authorization ID that was used lacks the authority to
create views with other qualifiers. Only an authorization ID that holds SYSADM or DBADM authority can create
views for other authorization IDs.
authorization-id
The authorization ID that was used for the CREATE VIEW statement.
qualifier-name
The qualifier that was specified in the CREATE VIEW statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The specified view is not created.
Programmer response: Do not attempt to create views with other than your own ID as a qualifier. The DBADM
privilege should be granted on any of the databases that contain at least one of the tables on which this CREATE
VIEW is based. For the view to be created successfully, system DBADM should have DATAACCESS authority or
select privilege on the tables on which this CREATE VIEW is based.
SQLSTATE: 42502
-170 THE NUMBER OF ARGUMENTS SPECIFIED FOR function-name IS INVALID
Explanation: An SQL statement includes a scalar function that contains too many or too few arguments.
function-name
The name of the function that contains the wrong number of arguments.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the statement.
SQLSTATE: 42605
Related reference:
Scalar functions (DB2 SQL)
-171 THE DATA TYPE, LENGTH, OR VALUE OF ARGUMENT argument-position OF function-name IS INVALID
Explanation: The data type, the length, or the value of an argument of a scalar function is incorrect.
argument-position
An integer that identifies the position of the incorrect argument in the function invocation.
function-name
The name of the scalar function.
System action: The statement that contains the function cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the invocation of the function, and reissue the statement.
Problem determination: If the encoding scheme is EBCDIC or ASCII, a possible reason for this error is that a
character argument was specified for a built-in function that expects a graphic argument, or a graphic argument was
specified for a built-in function that expects a character argument. The UNICODE encoding scheme supports the
mixing of character and graphic arguments, but EBCDIC and ASCII do not.
If the function is a string function, this code might be issued if a string unit was required but not specified. The
string unit keywords are CODEUNITS16, CODEUNITS32, and OCTETS.
If a default is defined for a parameter of the function, the value of the argument-position token for SQLCODE -171
might take into consideration the implicit argument.
For example, suppose that you invoke this function, in which parameter value '12' is invalid:
TRIM(¡¯12¡¯ FROM ¡¯123¡¯)
The first argument, BOTH, is implicitly specified. Therefore, the value of argument-position for parameter value '12' is
2.

-173 UR IS SPECIFIED ON THE WITH CLAUSE BUT THE CURSOR IS NOT READ-ONLY
Explanation: The cursor is not a read-only cursor. WITH UR can be specified only if DB2 can determine that the
cursor is read-only.
System action: Statement execution fails.
Programmer response: If the cursor is intended to be read-only but is ambiguous, add the FOR FETCH ONLY
clause. If the cursor is updatable, change the isolation level specified on the WITH clause.
SQLSTATE: 42801
-180 THE DATE, TIME, OR TIMESTAMP VALUE value IS INVALID
Explanation: The length or string representation of a DATE, TIME, or TIMESTAMP value does not conform to any
valid format.
The value can contain one of the following:
v For a host variable, the position number of the input host variable. If the position number cannot be determined, a
blank is displayed.
v For a character string constant, the character string constant. The maximum length that is displayed is the length
of SQLERRM.
v For a character column, the column name. If the column is a VIEW column and it has a corresponding base
column, the VIEW column name is displayed. If the column is a VIEW column but it does not have a
corresponding base column, a string of '*N' is displayed.
Otherwise, value is a string of '*N'.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the program to ensure the specified value conforms to the syntax of DATE, TIME,
and TIMESTAMP.

-181 THE STRING REPRESENTATION OF A DATETIME VALUE IS NOT A VALID DATETIME VALUE
Explanation: The string representation of a datetime is not in the acceptable range or is not in the correct format.
The proper ranges for datetime values are as follows:
Table 2. Range of datetime values
Datetime Specific Cases Numeric Range
Years 0001 to 9999
Table 2. Range of datetime values (continued)
Datetime Specific Cases Numeric Range
Months 1 to 12
Days For months:
v April (month 4)
v June (6)
v September (9)
v November (11)
1 to 30
For February (month 2) 1 to 28 (Years other than leap years.)
1 to 29 (Leap years only.)
For months:
v January (month 1)
v March (3)
v May (5)
v July (7)
v August (8)
v October (10)
v December (12)
1 to 31
Hours If the format for hours is USA 0 to 12
For all other predefined formats 0 to 24
Minutes 1 0 to 59
Seconds 1 0 to 59
Fractional seconds 1 0 to 999999
Time zone hours -12 to 14
Time zone minutes 0 to 59
Note:
1. When the hour format is not USA and the value of the hour is 24, other parts of time values are zeros.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Check whether the value is within the valid range and is in the proper format. Correct the
syntax, and reissue the statement.

-182 AN ARITHMETIC EXPRESSION WITH A DATETIME VALUE IS INVALID
Explanation: The specified arithmetic expression contains an improperly used datetime value or labeled duration.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the indicated arithmetic expression.
SQLSTATE: 42816
-183 AN ARITHMETIC OPERATION ON A DATE OR TIMESTAMP HAS A RESULT THAT IS NOT WITHIN THE VALID RANGE OF DATES
Explanation: The result of an arithmetic operation is a date or timestamp that is not within the valid range of dates
which are between 0001-01-01 and 9999-12-31.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Examine the SQL statement to see if the cause of the problem can be determined. The
problem may be data-dependent, in which case it will be necessary to examine the data that was processed at the
time the error occurred.
SQLSTATE: 22008
-184 AN ARITHMETIC EXPRESSION WITH A DATETIME VALUE CONTAINS A PARAMETER MARKER
Explanation: The specified arithmetic expression contains a parameter marker improperly used with a datetime
value.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the indicated arithmetic expression.
SQLSTATE: 42610
-185 THE LOCAL FORMAT OPTION HAS BEEN USED WITH A DATE OR TIME AND NO LOCAL EXIT HAS BEEN INSTALLED
Explanation: The local format option has been used with a datetime value and no datetime exit has been installed.
This may occur if the LOCAL DATE LENGTH or LOCAL TIME LENGTH on the Installation Application
Programming Defaults Panel indicated that an exit for datetime was supplied, but in fact the exit supplied by DB2
was not replaced. This may also occur if the datetime exit was replaced and the corresponding LOCAL DATE
LENGTH or LOCAL TIME LENGTH on the Installation Application Programming Defaults Panel was not set to a
nonzero value.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Contact the system programmer about installation of the date or time exit.
SQLSTATE: 57008
-186 THE LOCAL DATE LENGTH OR LOCAL TIME LENGTH HAS BEEN INCREASED AND EXECUTING PROGRAM RELIES ON THE OLD LENGTH
Explanation: The local format option has been used with a datetime value and DB2 has discovered that the
datetime exit routine has been changed to produce a longer local format.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If the statement receiving this error is embedded in the application program, then a REBIND
command must be issued for the application plan. If the statement was dynamic SQL, then the statement can be
reentered.
SQLSTATE: 22505
-187 A REFERENCE TO A CURRENT DATETIME SPECIAL REGISTER IS INVALID BECAUSE THE MVS TOD CLOCK IS BAD OR THE MVS PARMTZ IS OUT OF RANGE
Explanation: DB2 has encountered an invalid time-of-day (TOD) clock. The user referenced one of the special
registers: CURRENT DATE, CURRENT TIME, CURRENT TIMESTAMP, or CURRENT TIMEZONE. If the user
referenced CURRENT TIMEZONE, the MVS parameter PARMTZ was out of range.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: For CURRENT TIMEZONE, check that the MVS parameter PARMTZ is between -24 and +24
hours. For the other CURRENT special registers, check that the MVS TOD clock has been set correctly.
SQLSTATE: 22506
-188 THE STRING REPRESENTATION OF A NAME IS INVALID
Explanation: The host variable referenced in the DESCRIBE statement does not contain a valid string representation
of a name. One of the following error conditions has occurred.
v The first byte of the variable is a period or a blank.
v The number of identifiers is greater than 3.
v An identifier is too long.
v A period not contained in a delimited identifier is followed by a period or a blank.
v A delimited identifier is followed by a character other than a period or a blank.
v A delimited identifier is not terminated by a quotation mark.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the value of the host variable so that it is a valid string representation of a name.
SQLSTATE: 22503
-189 CCSID ccsid IS INVALID
Explanation: To determine the subtype of an input host variable or result column, the SYSSTRINGS catalog table
was accessed with the specified CCSID and, one of the following error conditions occurred:
v The CCSID is not a value of either INCCSID or OUTCCSID.
v The TRANSTYPE column classifies the CCSID as GRAPHIC rather than CHARACTER.
v A graphic CCSID has not been specified on your system.
v The CCSID is outside the acceptable range of values. The CCSID must be between 1 and 65533, inclusive, or the
value 65535.
v A DBCS CCSID was specified when casting to CHAR, VARCHAR or CLOB.
v An SBCS or mixed CCSID, or 65535 was specified when casting to a graphic data type.
v CCSID 65535, which is valid only for data with the FOR BIT DATA attribute, was specified when casting to a
CLOB.
This error can occur when SYSSTRINGS is accessed with a pair of CCSIDs to determine if a translation is defined for
the pair. In this case, the error is the inconsistency between the data type of a string and the TRANSTYPE
classification of its CCSID (one is GRAPHIC and the other is CHARACTER).
This error can also occur when a CCSID specified in DECP does not exist as a value in the INCCSID or OUTCCSID
columns of SYSSTRINGS.
Another reason this error can occur is that you may be using one of the graphic built-in functions but a graphic
CCSID was not specified during system installation.
System action: The statement cannot be bound or executed.
Programmer response: Ensure that the CCSID is valid and consistent with the data type of the string. If a valid
CCSID is not listed in a built-in row of SYSSTRINGS, it can be defined by inserting a user-provided row. If a valid
CCSID is misclassified in a user-provided row, that row can be updated to correct the mistake.
If a graphic CCSID had not been specified at system installation, update your DECP to include a graphic CCSID and
recycle your DB2.

-190 THE ATTRIBUTES SPECIFIED FOR THE COLUMN table-name.column-name ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE EXISTING COLUMN DEFINITION
Explanation: The attributes for the column in an ALTER TABLE statement are not compatible with the attributes of
the existing column.
table-name
The name of the table.
column-name
The name of the column.
Possible reasons for this error include:
Incompatible data type
The ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN SET DATA TYPE statement allows changing columns of the following
data types only:
v Character
v Numeric
v Binary
If the SET DATA TYPE clause was specified, the existing column is not compatible with the new data type
that was specified, or is of a data type that cannot be changed.
Identity column is required
The following clauses can be specified only for a column that is defined as an identity column:
v RESTART
v SET GENERATED
v SET INCREMENT BY
v SET MINVALUE and SET NO MINVALUE
v SET MAXVALUE and SET NO MAXVALUE
v SET CYCLE and SET NO CYCLE
v SET CACHE and SET NO CACHE
v SET ORDER and SET NO ORDER
If one of these clause was specified, the existing column is not defined as an identity column.
Default values
If a SET DEFAULT or DROP DEFAULT clause was specified, the existing column either:
v Does not have a defined default value, or the column has NOT NULL as the null attribute.
v Is defined as an identity column, ROWID, or row change timestamp column.
Changing ROW BEGIN, ROW END, or TRANSACTION START ID columns
If ALTER COLUMN was specified to change the column to a ROW BEGIN, ROW END, or TRANSACTION
START ID column:
v The column is already defined as a generated column.
v The column is already defined with a user-specified default value. Issue an ALTER TABLE statement to
drop the default value. Then the column definition can be changed.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Review the SQL statement and take the appropriate action, then resubmit the statement.
v Modify the statement so that the attributes that are specified for the altered column are compatible with the
existing column definition.
v Remove the incompatible attribute specification.
v Specify a different column.

-191 A STRING CANNOT BE USED BECAUSE IT IS INVALID MIXED DATA
Explanation: The operation required the conversion of a mixed data character string to a different coded character
set. The string could not be converted because it does not conform to the rules for well-formed mixed data.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If the string contains the intended information, the description of the column or host
variable should be changed from MIXED DATA to BIT or SBCS DATA. If the description of the column or host
variable is correct, the string is the problem and it must be changed to conform to the rules for well-formed mixed
data.

-197 A QUALIFIED COLUMN NAME IS NOT ALLOWED IN THE ORDER BY CLAUSE WHEN A SET OPERATOR IS ALSO SPECIFIED
Explanation: The ORDER BY clause of a fullselect that includes a set operator, such as UNION, EXCEPT, or
INTERSECT, cannot have qualified column names.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the statement to ensure that all column names in the ORDER BY clause are
unqualified.
SQLSTATE: 42877
-198 THE OPERAND OF THE PREPARE OR EXECUTE IMMEDIATE STATEMENT IS BLANK OR EMPTY
Explanation: The operand (host variable or string constant) that was the object of the PREPARE or EXECUTE
IMMEDIATE statement either contained all blanks or was an empty string. A DBRM built in Version 2 Release 3
cannot be used on a Version 2 Release 2 system if the distributive functions were used. If this error appears on
Version 2 Release 2 and the DBRM was built on Version 2 Release 3, then the program needs to be precompiled again
to correct the problem.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the logic of the application program to ensure that a valid SQL statement is provided
in the operand of the PREPARE or EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement before that statement is executed.
SQLSTATE: 42617
-199 ILLEGAL USE OF KEYWORD keyword. TOKEN token-list WAS EXPECTED
Explanation: A syntax error was detected in the statement at the point where the keyword keyword appears.
As an aid to the programmer, a partial list of valid tokens is provided in SQLERRM as token-list. Only those tokens
that will fit are listed. Some tokens in the list might not be valid in statements to be executed by DB2; those tokens
are valid for sending to other database management systems.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Examine the statement in the area of keyword keyword. A colon or SQL delimiter might be
missing.
Verify that the clauses are in the correct order. If the reserved word that is identified in the messages is listed as a
reserved word, make the word a delimited identifier.
SQLSTATE: 42601

-203 A REFERENCE TO COLUMN column-name IS AMBIGUOUS
Explanation: An unqualified column name is ambiguous if more than one table or view identified in the FROM
clause has a column with that name, or if more than one column of a nested table expression has that name.
A qualified column name is ambiguous only if the qualifier is the correlation name for a nested table expression and
the column name is not unique.
A reference to a column of the triggering table in a CREATE TRIGGER statement is ambiguous if it does not use the
correlation name to indicate if it refers to the old or new transition variable.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If the problem is caused by a nonunique column name in a nested table expression, change
the nested table expression so that the column name is unique. If the problem is caused by the use of an unqualified
name, qualify it with a table, view, or correlation name.
SQLSTATE: 42702
-204 name IS AN UNDEFINED NAME
Explanation: The object that is identified by name is not defined in the DB2 subsystem. This SQLCODE can be
generated for any type of DB2 object.
If the error was encountered for a particular version of a native SQL procedure, the name token might return the
following information:
name-of-procedure VERSION version-id
For COMMENT or DROP, if the specified object is a package, the implicitly or explicitly specified version of the
package is not defined in the DB2 subsystem. If the version-ID was not explicitly specified, the statement attempted
to process the null version for the identified package, but the null version does not exist. The VERSION clause can be
used to specify a specific version to be processed.
Attention: A function cannot be sourced on the COALESCE, NULLIF, RAISE_ERROR, RID, or VALUE built-in
functions. Additionally, there are restrictions on the way that you can source on the COUNT, COUNT_BIG, CHAR,
and STRIP built-in functions because of some of the keywords that they accept.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Verify that the object name was correctly specified in the SQL statement, including any
required qualifiers. If it is correct, ensure that the object exists in the system before resubmitting the statement.
If the specified object is a routine, issue the CREATE PROCEDURE or CREATE FUNCTION statement to define the
routine to DB2. Issue the -START PROCEDURE command to activate the new definition.
If the specified object is a package, issue the COMMENT or DROP statement with the VERSION clause to identify
the specific version to be processed.
SQLSTATE: 42704 46002
-205 column-name IS NOT A COLUMN OF TABLE table-name
Explanation: No column with the specified column-name occurs in the table table-name.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Verify that the column and table names are specified correctly (including any required
qualifiers) in the SQL statement.
SQLSTATE: 42703
-206 object-name IS NOT VALID IN THE CONTEXT WHERE IT IS USED
Explanation: An object is specified in a context where it is not valid.
object-name
The name of the object that could not be resolved.
Possible reasons for this error include:
v The specified name is not a column of any of the source or target tables or views of the statement.
¨C In a SELECT or DELETE statement, the specified name is not a column of any of the tables or views that are
identified in a FROM clause in the statement.
¨C In an INSERT, UPDATE, or MERGE statement, the specified name is not a column of the table, or view that was
specified as the target of the data change statement.
¨C A column list of an SQL data change statement specified a name that is not a column of the target table or view
of the statement.
v A qualified column name was specified, but the table designator that is specified as the qualifier is not defined in
this context.
v A correlated reference to a column was specified in an OLAP specification. Each column name that is referenced in
an OLAP specification must unambiguously reference a column of the result table of the subselect that contains the
OLAP specification.
v The specified period is not a period of any of the source or target tables or views of the statement.
v The target of an assignment clause of an SQL data change statement specified a name that is not a column of the
target table or view of the statement, or an INCLUDE column defined for the statement. For a DELETE statement,
the target of an assignment clause can only be an INCLUDE column.
v The source of an assignment clause of an SQL data change statement referenced an INCLUDE column in an
expression. A column defined in an INCLUDE clause can only be specified as the target of an assignment in an
SQL data change statement.
v A correlated reference to a column was specified for a grouping expression, which is not allowed.
v A column defined in the INCLUDE clause of an UPDATE or DELETE statement was referenced in the WHERE
clause of that statement.
v The specified name is a correlated column reference in a subselect, which is not allowed.
v A VALUES clause of an SQL data change statement specified the name of a column of the target table, which is not
allowed.
v For a CREATE or ALTER FUNCTION statement, or a CREATE or ALTER PROCEDURE statement:
¨C The specified name does not resolve to the name of a column or variable.
¨C The specified name resolves to the name of a variable that is not available in the current scope.
¨C The specified condition name name specified in the SIGNAL statement has not been declared.
v For a CREATE TRIGGER statement:
¨C A reference is made to a name using an OLD or NEW correlation name for a transition variable. The name is
not defined as a column in the triggering table.
¨C The target of an assignment in the triggered action specified an old transition variable that is not valid for the
type of trigger.
¨C The referenced name does not resolve to the name of a column or variable.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Verify the following items:
v For a SELECT statement:
¨C Ensure that all the required tables are specified in the FROM clause.
¨C Verify that all of the required tables or views were named in the FROM clause. If the name was intended to be a
correlated reference to a column, qualify the name with the correct table designator.
¨C For a subselect in an ORDER BY clause, ensure that there are no correlated column references.
v For a DELETE statement, ensure that columns that are defined in the INCLUDE clause are specified only as targets
of assignments.
v For a CREATE FUNCTION, ALTER FUNCTION, CREATE PROCEDURE or ALTER PROCEDURE statement,
ensure that:
¨C The specified name resolves to the name of a column or variable.
¨C The specified name resolves to the name of a variable that is available in the current scope.
¨C The specified condition name name specified in the SIGNAL statement has been declared.
v For a CREATE TRIGGER statement, ensure that:
¨C The target of an assignment in a SET transition-variable statement specifies only new transition variables. Any
reference to columns of the triggering table, including those that are contained in the top-level query block in
the WHEN clause search condition, are qualified with a transition variable correlation name.
¨C The top-level query block in the WHEN clause search condition contains only transition variables or transition
table correlation names.
SQLSTATE: 42703
-208 THE ORDER BY CLAUSE IS INVALID BECAUSE COLUMN column-name IS NOT PART OF THE RESULT TABLE
Explanation: The statement is invalid because a column (column-name) specified in the ORDER BY list does not
appear in the result table (that is, it is not specified in the SELECT-list). Only columns in the result table can be used
to order that result when the fullselect of the SELECT statement is not a subselect.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the syntax of the statement, either by adding the specified column to the result table,
or deleting it from the ORDER BY clause.

-212 name IS SPECIFIED MORE THAN ONCE IN THE REFERENCING CLAUSE OF A TRIGGER DEFINITION
Explanation: The REFERENCING clause of a CREATE TRIGGER statement specified the same name for more than
one of the OLD or NEW correlation names or the OLD_TABLE or NEW_TABLE identifiers. name is the name that
was specified multiple times.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The trigger was not created.
Programmer response: Change the statement to specify unique names for all transition variables and tables in the
REFERENCING clause and resubmit the CREATE TRIGGER request.
SQLSTATE: 42712
-214 AN EXPRESSION IN THE FOLLOWING POSITION, OR STARTING WITH position-or-expressionstart IN THE clause-type CLAUSE IS NOT VALID. REASON CODE = reason-code
Explanation: The expression identified by the first part of the expression expression-start in the clause-type clause is
not valid for the reason specified by the reason-code as follows:
1 The fullselect of the select-statement is not a subselect. Expressions are not allowed in the ORDER BY clause
for this type of select-statement. This reason code occurs only when clause-type is ORDER BY.
2 DISTINCT is specified in the SELECT clause, and either a column name in the ORDER BY clause cannot be
matched exactly with a column name in the select list, or a sort-key-expression is specified in the ORDER BY
clause. This reason code occurs only when clause-type is ORDER BY.
3 The select list includes an aggregate function or the subselect includes a GROUP BY clause and the
expression is not an aggregate function or does not match exactly with an expression in the select list.
4 Grouping is caused by the presence of an aggregate function in the ORDER BY clause. This reason code
occurs only when clause-type is ORDER BY.
5 Expression in a GROUP BY clause cannot contain a scalar-fullselect. This reason code occurs only when
clause-type is GROUP BY.
6 Invalid use of scalar-fullselect. This reason code can be issued when the scalar-fullselect appears in an
ORDER BY clause, the RETURN statement of an SQL function contains a scalar-fullselect, or a
scalar-fullselect is passed as an argument on a CALL statement for a parameter that is defined as an input
parameter (IN).
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Modify the select-statement based on the reason specified by the reason-code. Use the
following suggestions to modify the select-statement:
1 Remove the expression from the ORDER BY clause. If attempting to reference a column of the result, change
the sort key to the simple-integer or simple-column-name form. See the ORDER BY syntax diagram in the DB2
SQL Reference for more information.
2 Remove DISTINCT from the SELECT clause.
3 Change the expression in the ORDER BY or GROUP BY clause to an aggregate function or change the clause
to use a numeric column identifier or a column name.
4 Add a GROUP BY clause or remove the aggregate function from the ORDER BY clause.
5 Remove the scalar fullselect from the GROUP BY clause.
6 Remove the scalar fullselect from the statement.
SQLSTATE: 42822
-216 THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS ON EACH SIDE OF A PREDICATE OPERATOR DOES NOT MATCH. PREDICATE OPERATOR IS operator.
Explanation: The number of expressions specified on the left-hand side of OPERATOR operator is unequal to either
the number of values returned by the fullselect or to the number of expressions specified on the right-hand side of
the operator. The number of expressions and the number of values/expressions on either side of the operator must
be equal.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the number of expressions to match the number of values returned by the fullselect
or vice versa.
SQLSTATE: 428C4
-219 THE REQUIRED EXPLANATION TABLE table-name DOES NOT EXIST
Explanation: The EXPLAIN statement assumes the existence of an EXPLAIN table, but it is not defined in the DB2

-220 THE COLUMN column-name IN EXPLANATION TABLE table-name IS NOT DEFINED PROPERLY
Explanation: An error occurred during the insertion of a row into the EXPLAIN table.
column-name
The name of the column that caused the error. If the column definition is incorrect, column-name is the
name of the column in error. Otherwise, *N is returned for column-name because the column name is not
applicable.
table-name
The name of the EXPLAIN table.
Possible reasons for this error include:
v A column is missing.
v Columns are defined in the wrong order.
v The table contains an extra column.
v A column description is invalid because of its name, data type, length, or null attributes.
v The SQL statement contains contains mixed data, and the EXPLAIN table was defined as CCSID EBCDIC.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The EXPLAIN information is not generated.
Programmer response: Correct the definition of the required EXPLAIN table. If the SQL statement being explained
contains mixed data and the EXPLAIN table is defined as CCSID EBCDIC, take the following actions:
1. Copy the data from the EXPLAIN table.
2. Drop the EXPLAIN table.
3. Re-create the EXPLAIN table with CCSID UNICODE.
4. Copy the data into the EXPLAIN table.

-222 AN UPDATE OR DELETE OPERATION WAS ATTEMPTED AGAINST A HOLE USING CURSOR cursor-name
Explanation: DB2 could not process a positioned update or delete with cursor cursor-name that is defined as
SENSITIVE STATIC. The application program attempted to execute an UPDATE or DELETE WHERE CURRENT OF
cursor statement at a time when the specified cursor was positioned on a row of the object table that is a hole. Each
row that the cursor is positioned on, that is to be updated or deleted must not be a hole:
v An update hole occurs when the corresponding row of the underlying table has been updated, and the updated row
no longer satisfies the search condition that is specified in the SELECT statement of the cursor.
v A delete hole occurs when the corresponding row of the underlying table has been deleted.
This error might be issued if the following situations occur:
v If the cursor is not a rowset cursor, then the row corresponding to the current cursor position is either an update
hole, or a delete hole. DB2 detects these holes when DB2 tries to update or delete the current row of the result
table for the cursor cursor-name, and cannot locate the corresponding row of the underlying table.
v If the cursor is a rowset cursor, then a row corresponding to a row of the current rowset cursor position is either
an update hole or a delete hole. DB2 detects these holes when DB2 tries to update or delete the current row of the
result table for cursor cursor-name, and cannot locate the corresponding row or rows of the underlying table.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No data was updated or deleted, and the cursor position is
unchanged.
Programmer response: Correct the logic of the application program to ensure that the cursor is correctly positioned
on the intended row or rows of the object table, and that the intended rows are not holes, before the DELETE or
UPDATE statement is executed.
v If the cursor is not a rowset cursor, then issue a FETCH statement to position the cursor on a row that is not a
hole. Then, reissue the UPDATE or DELETE statement.
v If the cursor is a rowset cursor, and is also the positioned UPDATE or DELETE statement intended to affect a
single row corresponding to the rows of the current rowset cursor position (this means for a FOR ROW n of
ROWSET clause was specified), then change the UPDATE or DELETE statement to process the rows that are not
holes, one at a time.
v If the cursor is a rowset cursor, and is also the positioned UPDATE or DELETE statement intended to affect all
rows corresponding to the rows of the current rowset cursor position (this means for a FOR ROW n of ROWSET
clause was not specified), then change the UPDATE or DELETE statement to process the rows that are not holes,
one at a time. Add a FOR ROW n of ROWSET clause to the UPDATE or DELETE statement to indicate which row
of the cursor is to be updated or deleted.
SQLSTATE: 24510
-224 THE RESULT TABLE DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE BASE TABLE USING cursor-name
Explanation: A positioned UPDATE or DELETE was attempted on a row that no longer matches its previous
condition. The column values in the result table row no longer match the current values in the base table row. The
row was updated after it was inserted into the result table but before the positioned update or delete was completed.
cursor-name
The name of the cursor that was used for the positioned update or delete.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The cursor is positioned on the same row.
Programmer response: Correct the application program to handle this error condition, or change the isolation levels
so that the base row cannot be updated during the cursor operation.

-225 FETCH STATEMENT FOR cursor-name IS NOT VALID FOR THE DECLARATION OF THE CURSOR
Explanation: DB2 could not process a FETCH statement for cursor cursor-name because it contained a disallowed
keyword. One of the following errors have occurred:
v A FETCH statement for a non-scrollable cursor specified one of the keywords PRIOR, FIRST, LAST, ABSOLUTE,
RELATIVE, CURRENT, BEFORE, or AFTER. These keywords are disallowed for a cursor that was not declared
with the SCROLL attribute, however, the CURRENT clause is allowed with a non-scrollable cursor only when
combined with the CONTINUE clause.
v CONTINUE was specified on the FETCH statement, but the specified cursor was opened for a multiple-row fetch
operation. This combination is not supported.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No data was written to the output host variables.
Programmer response: If a scrolling option was specified on the FETCH statement for a non-scrollable cursor,
correct the FETCH statement to exclude the disallowed keyword, or, correct the DECLARE CURSOR statement to
include the appropriate SCROLL option. If the CONTINUE clause was specified for a multiple-row cursor, change
the application to use single row fetch for this cursor. If multiple-row fetch is required, use another technique, such
as a LOB locator for retrieving large LOB or XML values.
SQLSTATE: 42872
-227 FETCH fetch-orientation IS NOT ALLOWED, BECAUSE CURSOR cursor-name HAS AN UNKNOWN POSITION (sqlcode,sqlstate)
Explanation: The cursor position for cursor-name is unknown. The previous multiple-row FETCH for cursor
cursor-name resulted in an error (SQLCODE sqlcode, SQLSTATE sqlstate) in the middle of processing multiple rows
that were retrieved from DB2. One or more of the requested rows could not be returned to the program following the
error, leaving the position of the cursor unknown.
If an indicator structure had been provided on the previous multiple-row FETCH, a positive SQLCODE would have
been returned and all of the rows that were retrieved from DB2 could have been returned to the application program.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The cursor position is not changed.
Programmer response: Close and reopen the cursor to reset the position. For scrollable cursors, you can change the
FETCH statement to specify one of the other fetch orientations (such as FIRST, LAST, BEFORE, AFTER, or
ABSOLUTE) to establish a valid cursor position and fetch a row of data.
SQLSTATE: 24513
-228 FOR UPDATE CLAUSE SPECIFIED FOR READ-ONLY CURSOR cursor-name
Explanation: A cursor was declared read-only with the INSENSITIVE SCROLL option, but the SELECT statement
contained a FOR UPDATE clause.
cursor-name
Name of the cursor used for the FETCH.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: To define a scrollable cursor that is read-only, specify INSENSITIVE SCROLL, but do not
specify FOR UPDATE clause. To define a scrollable cursor that can be updated, specify SENSITIVE SCROLL. Correct
the application program to DECLARE CURSOR appropriately.
SQLSTATE: 42620
-229 THE LOCALE locale SPECIFIED IN A SET LC_CTYPE OR OTHER STATEMENT THAT IS LOCALE SENSITIVE WAS NOT FOUND
Explanation: The statement attempted to reference a locale that is not known or not available to DB2. The value of
the variable locale indicates what locale DB2 is using when it processed the statement. DB2 used the locale that was
either specified on the SET CURRENT LOCALE LC_CTYPE statement or the locale that was in effect at the time the
locale access was attempted.
System action: The statement cannot be executed.
Programmer response: Depending on whether the locale was explicitly specified in a SET CURRENT LOCALE
LC_CTYPE statement or the current locale was used implicitly, complete one of the following actions:
v If the statement was a SET CURRENT LOCALE LC_CTYPE statement, re-specify a locale that is correct (known
and available to DB2).
v If the statement was something other than SET CURRENT LOCALE LC_CTYPE, then the statement contained a
locale sensitive interface (the UPPER function is an example of a locale sensitive interface).
Issue the following statement to determine the value of the locale in use by your program:
SELECT CURRENT LOCALE LC_CTYPE FROM
SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1.
Another possible reason for this message is that DB2 used an incorrect locale default value specified at installation
time. Because locales are dynamic, they can be added, created, or deleted at anytime. DB2 does not validate the value
of the locale until it is used. Therefore, it is possible to specify a locale that is not valid at installation time.
For information about locales and their naming conventions, see z/OS XL C/C++ Programming Guide.
SQLSTATE: 42708
-240 THE PARTITION CLAUSE OF A LOCK TABLE STATEMENT IS INVALID
Explanation: The LOCK TABLE statement is invalid for one of the following reasons:
v If it is partitioned, specify a PARTITION clause that identifies the partition you want to lock.
System action: The LOCK TABLE statement cannot be executed.
Programmer response: Determine whether the specified table resides in a partitioned table space defined with
LOCKPART YES.
v If it is partitioned and defined with LOCKPART YES, specify a PART clause that identifies the partition you want
to lock.
v If it is partitioned but does not have the LOCKPART YES attribute and you want to lock a single partition, use
ALTER TABLESPACE to change the LOCKPART attribute to YES.
v If it is not partitioned, do not specify the PART clause.
SQLSTATE: 428B4
-242 THE OBJECT NAMED object-name OF TYPE object-type WAS SPECIFIED MORE THAN ONCE IN THE LIST OF OBJECTS, OR THE NAME IS THE SAME AS AN EXISTING OBJECT
Explanation: In a list of object names of type object-type, the object named object-name was specified more than once,
or is the same as an existing name of that type.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Correct the error by removing all of the duplicate occurrences of the object from the list.
SQLSTATE: 42713
-243 SENSITIVE CURSOR cursor-name CANNOT BE DEFINED FOR THE SPECIFIED SELECT STATEMENT
Explanation: A clause was not valid for one of the following reasons:
v The cursor, cursor-name, is defined as SENSITIVE, but the content of the SELECT statement makes the cursor
read-only. In most cases the SELECT statement requires DB2 to build a temporary table or work file with the result
table of the cursor, and DB2 cannot guarantee that changes made outside the cursor will be visible. In this case, the
cursor must be defined INSENSITIVE or ASENSITIVE.
v The cursor, cursor-name, is defined as SENSITIVE DYNAMIC and a FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY clause was
specified for outermost subselect.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If the cursor is defined as SENSITIVE, but the content of the SELECT statement makes the
cursor read-only, either change the content of the query to result in a result table that is not read-only, or change the
type of cursor to be INSENSITIVE or ASENSITIVE.
If the cursor is defined as SENSITIVE DYNAMIC and a FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY clause was specified for
outermost subselect, either change the cursor sensitivity or change the outermost subselect to remove the FETCH
FIRST n ROWS ONLY clause.
SQLSTATE: 36001
-244 SENSITIVITY sensitivity SPECIFIED ON THE FETCH IS NOT VALID FOR CURSOR cursor-name
Explanation: The sensitivity option specified on FETCH conflicts with the sensitivity option in effect for cursor
cursor-name. If a cursor is declared INSENSITIVE, the FETCH statement can only specify INSENSITIVE or nothing. If
a cursor is declared SENSITIVE, the FETCH statement can specify INSENSITIVE, SENSITIVE, or nothing.
The keyword INSENSITIVE is not allowed with the FETCH statements if the associated cursor is either:
v Declared as SENSITIVE DYNAMIC SCROLL, or
v The cursor is declared ASENSITIVE, and DB2 selected the maximum allowable sensitivity of SENSITIVE
DYNAMIC SCROLL for the associated SELECT statement.
In the case of a non-scrollable cursor, the sensitivity option cannot be specified.
sensitivity
Specified sensitivity for the FETCH statement.
cursor-name
Name of the cursor used for the FETCH statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change or remove the sensitivity option that is specified on the FETCH.
SQLSTATE: 428F4
-245 THE INVOCATION OF FUNCTION routine-name IS AMBIGUOUS
Explanation: DB2 was not able to resolve the indicated function.
routine-name
The name of the function.
This situation can occur in the following circumstances:
v An untyped parameter marker is passed to a function and there are two or more possible candidate functions to
resolve to during function resolution.
v DB2 cannot determine how to implicitly cast the arguments between string and numeric data types.
v DB2 is unable to resolve a function invocation using the promotable process or castable process of function
resolution.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the problem and reissue the statement. You might need to change the SQL statement,
the definition of a function, or the user's SQL path.
SQLSTATE: 428F5

-246 STATEMENT USING CURSOR cursor-name SPECIFIED NUMBER OF ROWS num-rows WHICH IS NOT VALID WITH dimension
Explanation: A multiple-row FETCH, MERGE, or INSERT statement is not valid in this context. The statement is
invalid for one of the following reasons:
v The specified number of rows is not greater than 0 and not less than or equal to 32767.
v The specified number of rows is greater than the dimension of the host variable array.
v If the statement is a multiple-row FETCH statement that is executed in a distributed environment or is executed on
an accelerator, the computed maximum size of the reply data exceeds the DB2 limit. The computed maximum size
of the reply data is the product of the number of rows and the maximum size of the data that is returned in a
single row of the query.
cursor-name
If the SQL statement is a FETCH statement, this value is the name of the cursor that was used for the
FETCH statement. If the SQL statement is not a FETCH statement, this value is the string *N. *N indicates
that the cursor name is not applicable.
num-rows
The number of rows that were specified.
dimension
If the statement is not a multiple-row FETCH statement that is executed in a distributed environment, and is
not a multiple-row FETCH statement that is executed on an accelerator, this value is the dimension of the
array.
If the statement is a multiple-row FETCH statement that is executed in a distributed environment, or a
multiple-row FETCH statement that is executed on an accelerator, this value is the string *N. *N indicates
that the dimension is not applicable.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The cursor position is unchanged.
Programmer response: Take one of the following actions:
v Change the application to declare or allocate a host variable array that is large enough to contain the specified
number of rows.
v Change the specified number of rows to be between 1 and 32767, inclusive.
v If the statement is a multiple-row FETCH statement that is executed in a distributed environment, or is executed
on an accelerator, decrease the specified number of rows.
SQLSTATE: 42873
-247 A HOLE WAS DETECTED ON A MULTIPLE ROW FETCH STATEMENT USING CURSOR cursor-name, BUT INDICATOR VARIABLES WERE NOT PROVIDED TO DETECT THE CONDITION
Explanation: A hole was detected on a FETCH statement for multiple rows of data, but no indicator variables were
provided to reflect the situation to the application.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the FETCH statement to provide at least one indicator variable, and resubmit the
statement.
SQLSTATE: 24519
-248 A POSITIONED DELETE OR UPDATE STATEMENT FOR CURSOR cursor-name SPECIFIED ROW n OF A ROWSET, BUT THE ROW IS NOT CONTAINED WITHIN THE CURRENT ROWSET
Explanation: The FOR ROW n OF ROWSET clause was specified on a positioned DELETE or UPDATE statement,
but row n is not contained within the bound of the rowset. This situation can also occur when row n is within the
bounds of the rowset that was requested, but the current rowset contains less than the requested number of rows. In
this case, a partial rowset is returned. A partial rowset can occur for various reasons, including an end of data
condition or an error that did not result in the closure of the cursor.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Reissue the positioned UPDATE or DELETE with a value that corresponds to a row of the
current rowset. If the row that is specified is outside of the current rowset, then do the following:
v Use the FOR n ROWS clause on a FETCH CURRENT ROWSET statement to specify that the rowset contains a
larger number of rows
v Reissue the positioned UPDATE or DELETE statement.
If this message is issued because a partial rowset was returned,
v Update the application logic to detect that the actual rowset size was less than the rowset size that was requested
v Ensure that a positioned UPDATE or DELETE statement only refers to rows of the current rowset.
SQLSTATE: 24521
-249 DEFINITION OF ROWSET ACCESS FOR CURSOR cursor-name IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE FETCH ORIENTATION CLAUSE clause SPECIFIED
Explanation: A clause specified for the FETCH statement is inconsistent with the definition of the cursor cursor-name.
This error can be issued for the following situations:
v A cursor defined WITHOUT ROWSET POSITIONING can only use BEFORE, AFTER, row positioned fetch
orientation keywords: NEXT, PRIOR, FIRST, LAST, CURRENT, ABSOLUTE, or RELATIVE.
v A cursor defined WITH ROWSET POSITIONING can use BEFORE, AFTER, rowset positioned fetch orientation
clauses: NEXT ROWSET, PRIOR ROWSET, FIRST ROWSET, LAST ROWSET, CURRENT ROWSET, or ROWSET
STARTING AT, or, row positioned fetch orientation keywords: NEXT, PRIOR, FIRST, LAST, CURRENT,
ABSOLUTE, or RELATIVE.
A FOR n ROWS clause was specified on a FETCH statement, but the cursor is not defined for rowset access.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the fetch orientation, remove the FOR n ROWS clause, or redefine the cursor.
SQLSTATE: 24523
-250 THE LOCAL LOCATION NAME IS NOT DEFINED WHEN PROCESSING A THREE-PART OBJECT NAME
Explanation: A three-part object name (table, view, or alias) cannot be used until the local location name is defined.
System action: Install or reinstall the DB2 distributed data facility (DDF) with a registered location name for local
DB2.
Programmer response: Define the local location name and then retry the function.
SQLSTATE: 42718
-251 TOKEN name IS NOT VALID
Explanation: A location name cannot contain alphabetic extenders. (The standard alphabetic extenders in the United
States are #, @, $.)
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the name and reissue the statement.
SQLSTATE: 42602
-253 A NON-ATOMIC statement STATEMENT SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED FOR SOME OF THE REQUESTED ROWS, POSSIBLY WITH WARNINGS, AND ONE OR MORE ERRORS
Explanation: A non-atomic statement statement successfully processed some of the rows of data that were requested.
However, one or more error conditions occurred, and some warnings might have also occurred. Use GET
DIAGNOSTICS to obtain information about the error and warning conditions that occurred.
System action: One or more rows were successfully processed, but one or more errors or warnings also occurred.
Programmer response: Analyze the error and warning conditions to determine if the statement should be rolled
back.
SQLSTATE: 22529
-254 A NON-ATOMIC statement STATEMENT ATTEMPTED TO PROCESS MULTIPLE ROWS OF DATA, BUT ERRORS OCCURRED
Explanation: A non-atomic statement statement specified that multiple rows of data were to be processed, but errors
occurred during the processing of those rows of data. Use GET DIAGNOSTICS to obtain information about the error
and warning conditions that occurred.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Analyze the error and warning conditions to determine the appropriate corrective actions.
SQLSTATE: 22530
-270 FUNCTION NOT SUPPORTED
Explanation: The statement cannot be processed because it violates one or more of the following restrictions:
ALTER INDEX or CREATE INDEX statements
v A CREATE INDEX or ALTER INDEX statement must not specify PADDED for an XML index or an index
on a VARBINARY column.
v A CREATE INDEX statement must not specify ASC, DESC, or RANDOM for an XML index.

v The result table of the fullselect in the as-result-table clause of a CREATE TABLE statement includes data
that is encoded with different CCSID sets. The result table must not use multiple CCSID sets.
v The internal limit of 30000 bytes for the versioned object descriptor (OBD) was exceeded. This condition
can happen when an ALTER table statement results in a new table version or index version, or is executed
on a versioned table.
v INLINE LENGTH is not allowed for the LOB column because the table space is not a universal table
space.
v An ALTER TABLE statement was specified with an ADD PERIOD clause and a column mask or row
permission is defined for the table. A period cannot be added to a table for which a column mask or row
permission is defined.

DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE statements
v The result table of the fullselect in the as-result-table clause of a DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE
statement includes data that is encoded with different CCSID sets. The result table must not use multiple
CCSID sets, other than EBCDIC and Unicode.
v The IMPLICITLY HIDDEN clause must not be specified for a column that is defined as a ROWID, or a
distinct type that is based on a ROWID.
v A BINARY or VARBINARY column cannot be specified in a partitioning key.
v The LIKE clause of a DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE must not reference an accelerator-only
table.
Related information:

MERGE statements
v A column of the source table is referenced multiple times in a modification operation of the MERGE
statement. When extended indicators are in effect, a column of the source table must not be referenced
more than one time in a modification operation. A modification operation is an update operation or an
insert operation. Extended indicators are in effect when EXTENDEDINDICATOR(YES) is used, or when
the WITH EXTENDED INDICATORS prepare attribute is specified for the MERGE statement.
Related information:
MERGE (DB2 SQL)
TRIGGER statements
v A CREATE TRIGGER statement must not specify a view that has any of the following types of columns:
¨C ROWID columns
¨C LOB columns
¨C XML columns
¨C Defined (directly or indirectly) as identity columns
¨C Security label columns

references an accelerator-only table in the body of the trigger.
v The transition variable that is specified does not support XML.
Related information:
CREATE TRIGGER (DB2 SQL)
UPDATE statements:
Some UPDATE statements that modify data in a column for which a BEFORE UPDATE trigger is defined
might result in this code in certain circumstances.
v If a BEFORE UPDATE TRIGGER statement contains a SET clause for one or more columns that participate
in the access path index, execution of the BEFORE UPDATE TRIGGER statement might cause the row to
qualify again. This situation occurs when all of the following conditions are met:
¨C DB2 is using an index access path to locate rows that qualify for update.
¨C A BEFORE TRIGGER exists on the table to which the rows belong.
¨C The BEFORE TRIGGER updates the values of one or more columns that participate in the access path
index.
This situation can happen with both searched updates and positioned updates (updates that use the
statement UPDATE WHERE CURRENT OF CURSOR). This code is issued for statements that are
susceptible to this problem, even if the data involved in the update would not cause requalification. See
¡°Programmer response¡± for information about handling requalification errors.
Other restrictions for SQL statements:
v Views and SQL functions that are referenced in an SQL statement must have the same rounding mode as
the SQL statement. Views and SQL functions that have undefined rounding mode information are ignored
during rounding mode checking.
v In a subselect, the select list cannot contain an XML column if OLD TABLE is specified.
v The RID built-in function and ROW CHANGE TOKEN expression must not be specified in a subselect
when that subselect directly includes one of the following operators:
¨C LEFT OUTER JOIN
¨C RIGHT OUTER JOIN
¨C FULL OUTER JOIN
v The ROW CHANGE TIMESTAMP expression can be specified only in a subselect when the following
conditions are true:
¨C That subselect directly includes a LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, or FULL OUTER JOIN
operator.
¨C The table designator identifies a base table that contains a row change timestamp column.
v An SQL table function must not be invoked with an expression that is derived from a column that is
defined with a field procedure.
v An input argument for an SQL table function must not contain a scalar fullselect, a function, or a column
reference, either directly or as part of an expression.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the syntax, and resubmit the statement. For the following errors, take the specified
actions.
Errors that are caused by an XML data type
If this error is caused by an XML data type, input the XML data to one of the functions that accept XML
input. Store the output of the function in the database, or return it to the application.
Errors that are caused by the rounding mode
If this error is caused by different rounding modes, take one of the following actions:
If a view or SQL function has a different rounding mode than the referencing SQL statement:
Change the SQL statement or change the rounding mode in effect to make sure all the views or
SQL functions that are referenced have the same rounding mode as the SQL statement. A new view,
SQL function, or both might be needed to match the rounding mode of the SQL statement.
If a view or SQL function has a different rounding mode than the referencing view during execution of
CREATE VIEW:
Change the view definition or change the rounding mode in effect to make sure all the views or
SQL functions that are referenced have the same rounding mode as the referencing view. A new
view, SQL function, or both might be needed to match the rounding mode of the referencing view.
If a view or SQL function has a different rounding mode than the referencing view during execution of
ALTER VIEW REGENERATE:
Change the rounding mode in effect to make sure all the views or SQL functions that are referenced
have the same rounding mode as the referencing view. The view for ALTER VIEW REGENERATE
might always fail. In this case, drop and re-create the view with a different view definition that
references a new view or SQL function.
Errors that are caused by the requalification of data
If the problem is caused by requalification of data that was set by a BEFORE UPDATE TRIGGER statement,
take one of the following actions:
v Ensure that the columns that are modified by the trigger are also modified by the UPDATE statement
itself. Modify the UPDATE statement to include a dummy clause of the type column-name=column-name for
each column that the BEFORE UPDATE TRIGGER modifies.
v Rebind with hints to cause the RIDLIST access path to use the same index.
Errors that are caused by size of the OBDREC
If the size of the OBDREC exceeds 30,000 bytes, you might be able to reclaim some space in the OBD by
reducing the size of the default value for varying-length columns, if any exist.
SQLSTATE: 42997
-300 THE STRING CONTAINED IN HOST VARIABLE OR PARAMETER position-number IS NOT NUL-TERMINATED
Explanation: A host variable or parameter is invalid. Its entry in the SQLDA is indicated by position-number. The
host variable or parameter is a C string variable that is one of the following:
v Used as an input parameter to a stored procedure or function.
v Returned as an output parameter from a stored procedure or function.
v Referenced as an input variable in an embedded SQL statement.
v Used to provide a value for a parameter marker of a dynamic SQL statement.
If the data type of the variable is character string, it is invalid because it does not include X'00'. If the data type of the
variable is graphic string, it is invalid because it does not include X'0000'.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Append a NUL-terminator to the end of the string.
SQLSTATE: 22024
-301 THE VALUE OF INPUT HOST VARIABLE OR PARAMETER NUMBER position-number CANNOT BE USED AS SPECIFIED BECAUSE OF ITS DATA TYPE
Explanation: DB2 received data that could not be used as specified in the statement because its data type is
incompatible with the requested operation.
The position-number identifies either the host variable number (if the message is issued as a result of an INSERT,
UPDATE, MERGE, DELETE, SELECT, VALUES INTO, or SET assignment statement), or the parameter number (if the
message is issued as the result of a CALL statement, or the invocation of a function).
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the application program, function or stored procedure. Ensure that the data type of
the indicated input host variable or parameter in the statement is compatible with the way it is used.
SQLSTATE: 42895
-302 THE VALUE OF INPUT VARIABLE OR PARAMETER NUMBER position-number IS INVALID OR TOO LARGE FOR THE TARGET COLUMN OR THE TARGET VALUE
Explanation: DB2 received data that was invalid or too large to fit in the corresponding column of the table or the
corresponding target value. The position-number identifies either the host variable number (if the message is issued as
a result of an INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, DELETE, SELECT, VALUES INTO, or SET assignment statement), or the
parameter number (if the message is issued as the result of a CALL statement or the invocation of a function).
One of the following occurred:
v The column is defined as a string and the host variable or parameter contains a string that is too long for the
column.
v The column is defined as numeric and the host variable or parameter contains a numeric value too large for the
definition of the column.
v The host variable is defined as decimal, but contains invalid decimal data.
v The target value is a string constant and the host variable or parameter contains a string that is too long for the
target value.
v The target value is a numeric constant and the host variable or parameter contains a numeric value that is too
large for the target value.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the application program, function or stored procedure. Check the column type and
length of the value or the data type and contents of the input host variable or parameter position-number. Ensure that
the value of the host variable or parameter will fit in the column or contains valid decimal data. Valid decimal data is
a System/370 packed decimal number.
SQLSTATE: 22003 if number too large for target; 22001 otherwise.
-303 A VALUE CANNOT BE ASSIGNED TO OUTPUT HOST VARIABLE NUMBER position-number BECAUSE THE DATA TYPES ARE NOT COMPARABLE
Explanation: A CALL, FETCH, SELECT, VALUES INTO, or SET statement with an output host variable could not be
performed because the data type of a variable was not compatible with the data type of the corresponding SELECT,
VALUES INTO, or SET statement list element.
position-number
Location of the host variable value in the output SQLDA.
The values of the output host variable and the corresponding list element must be in one of the following categories:
v One value is numeric and one of the following conditions is true:
¨C The other value is also numeric.
¨C The other value is a character string.
¨C The other value is a graphic string and uses Unicode.
¨C The statement has a subtype of FOR BIT DATA.
v Both must be character strings, unless you are using Unicode.
v Both must be graphic strings, unless you are using Unicode.
v Both must be row IDs.
v Both must be binary strings, or one can be BINARY or VARBINARY, and the other can be FOR BIT DATA.
v A variable is XML or binary XML and the corresponding statement list element is XML.
In addition, for datetime or timestamp values, the target host variable must be a character string variable with a
correct length.
System action: The statement was not executed. No data is retrieved.
Programmer response: Verify that table definitions are current, and that the target variable has the correct data type.
SQLSTATE: 42806
-304 A VALUE WITH DATA TYPE data-type1 CANNOT BE ASSIGNED TO A HOST VARIABLE BECAUSE THE VALUE IS NOT WITHIN THE RANGE OF THE HOST VARIABLE IN POSITION position-number WITH DATA TYPE data-type2
Explanation: A CALL, FETCH, SELECT, VALUES INTO, or SET assignment statement with a host variable list or
structure in position number position-number failed because the host variable with data type data-type2 was not large
enough to hold the retrieved value with data type data-type1.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No data was retrieved. If the statement was a FETCH, the cursor
remains open.
Programmer response: Verify that table definitions are current, and that the host variable has the correct data type.
See the explanation for SQLCODE -405 for ranges of SQL data types.
SQLSTATE: 22003
-305 THE NULL VALUE CANNOT BE ASSIGNED TO OUTPUT HOST VARIABLE NUMBER position-number BECAUSE NO INDICATOR VARIABLE IS SPECIFIED
Explanation: A FETCH, SELECT, VALUES INTO, or SET assignment statement resulted in the retrieval of a null
value to be inserted into the output host variable, designated by entry number 'position-number' of the output
SQLDA, for which no indicator variable was provided. An indicator variable must be supplied if a column returns a
null value.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No data was retrieved.
Programmer response: Examine the definition of the table that is the object of the statement and correct the
application program to provide indicator variables for all host variables into which null values can be retrieved. This
includes host variables for columns which can contain null values and host variables which receive the results of
aggregate functions whose result table could be empty.
SQLSTATE: 22002
-309 A PREDICATE IS INVALID BECAUSE A REFERENCED HOST VARIABLE HAS THE NULL VALUE
Explanation: The statement could not be processed because a host variable appearing in a predicate such as
column-name = host-variable
had the NULL value. Such a predicate is not permitted when the host variable contains the NULL value even though
the object column might contain nulls.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Rebind the plan or package containing the statement. The condition described is not an error
in DB2 Version 2 Release 3 and later releases.
SQLSTATE: 22512
-310 DECIMAL HOST VARIABLE OR PARAMETER number CONTAINS NON-DECIMAL DATA
Explanation: DB2 received nondecimal data from either an application (in the form of a host variable), function or a
stored procedure (in the form of a parameter that was passed to or from function or a stored procedure).
number Identifies either the host variable number (if the message is issued as a result of a FETCH, INSERT,
UPDATE, MERGE, DELETE, SELECT, VALUES INTO, or SET assignment statement), or the parameter
number (if the message is issued as the result of the invocation of a function, or a CALL statement).
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the application program or stored procedure. Ensure that all decimal variables or
parameters contain valid System/370 packed decimal numbers.
SQLSTATE: 22023
-311 THE LENGTH OF INPUT HOST VARIABLE NUMBER position-number IS NEGATIVE OR GREATER THAN THE MAXIMUM
Explanation: When evaluated, the length specification for input host string variable, whose entry in the SQLDA is
indicated by position-number, was negative or greater than the maximum.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the program to ensure that the lengths of all host string variables are not negative or
that they are not greater than the maximum allowed length.
SQLSTATE: 22501
-312 VARIABLE variable-name IS NOT DEFINED OR NOT USABLE
Explanation: A variable is referenced in the SQL statement, but it either is not defined or cannot be used.
variable-name
The name of the variable that is referenced in the statement.
One of the following conditions exists:
v The variable is not declared.
v The attributes of the variable are inconsistent with its usage in the SQL statement.
v The host variable was specified in a dynamic SQL statement. Host variables are not valid in dynamic SQL
statements.
v A host variable array is used in a context in which it is unsupported.
v The variable appeared in one of the triggered SQL statements in a CREATE TRIGGER statement. An OLD
transition variable cannot be modified in a trigger body.
v The variable name is used in the body of an SQL procedure, SQL function, or trigger, but the variable is not
declared as an SQL variable or parameter. The scope of an SQL variable is the compound statement that contains
the declaration, including any compound statements that are nested within that compound statement.
v The variable appeared in one of the key-expressions of an index definition.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Do one of the following solutions and try the request again:
v Verify that the program or SQL routine contains a declaration for the variable. Verify that the variable name in the
SQL statement is spelled correctly.
v Verify that the attributes of the variable are compatible with its use in the statement.
v Use parameter markers in a dynamic SQL statement instead of host variables.
v Specify a NEW transition variable when the variable is modified in a trigger.
v Declare the variable as an SQL variable or parameter in the SQL routine.
v Check the definition of the index and remove any host variables that are specified.

-313 THE NUMBER OF HOST VARIABLES SPECIFIED IS NOT EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF PARAMETER MARKERS
Explanation: The number of host variables specified in the EXECUTE or OPEN statement is not the same as the
number of parameter markers (question marks) appearing in the prepared SQL statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the application program so that the number of host variables specified in the
EXECUTE or OPEN statement is the same as the number of parameter markers appearing in the prepared SQL
statement. The DESCRIBE INPUT SQL statement can be used to determine the expected number of input parameter
markers.
SQLSTATE: 07001
-314 THE STATEMENT CONTAINS AN AMBIGUOUS HOST VARIABLE REFERENCE
Explanation: A host variable used in the statement has been defined more than once in this application program
causing confusion as to which host variable defined should be used.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Make the host variable unique or use qualifications to indicate which host variable definition
is to be used.
SQLSTATE: 42714
-327 THE ROW CANNOT BE INSERTED BECAUSE IT IS OUTSIDE THE BOUND OF THE PARTITION RANGE FOR THE LAST PARTITION
Explanation: When a row is inserted, the calculated partition key value for the new row must be within the bounds
of a partition (as specified in the VALUES clause of the CREATE INDEX statement).
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the statement to specify a value for the partition key that is within the bounds of the
last partition of the partitioned table space.
SQLSTATE: 22525
-330 A STRING CANNOT BE USED BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE PROCESSED. REASON reason-code, CHARACTER code-point, HOST VARIABLE position-number
Explanation: AN error occurred during the processing of a string, or in the conversion of a string. The type of error
is indicated by the reason-code:
8 Length exception (for example, expansion required for PC MIXED data exceeds the maximum length of the
string).
12 Invalid code point (for example, use of the ERRORBYTE option of SYSSTRINGS).
16 Form exception (for example, invalid MIXED data).
20 Conversion procedure error (for example, an exit set the length control field of the string to an invalid
value).
24 SBCS character found in string contained in a wchar_t or sqldbchar host variable.
If the reason-code is 12, code-point is the invalid code point. Otherwise, code-point is either blank or an additional
reason-code returned by an exit.
If the string is the value of an input host variable, the position-number is the ordinality of the variable in the SQLDA.
If the string is not the value of a host variable, the position-number is blank.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Take one of the following actions based on the reason-code:
8 Extend the maximum length of the host variable to allow for the expansion that occurs when the string is
converted.
12 Change the convert table to accept the code-point or the data to eliminate the code-point.
16 If the string is described as MIXED data, change its description or change the string to conform to the rules
for well-formed mixed data.
20 Correct the conversion procedure.
24 Delete the SBCS character from the graphic string.
SQLSTATE: 22021
-331 CHARACTER CONVERSION CANNOT BE PERFORMED BECAUSE A STRING, POSITION position-number, CANNOT BE CONVERTED FROM source-ccsid TO target-ccsid, REASON reason-code
Explanation: The operation required the conversion from source-ccsid to target-ccsid and a conversion error occurred.
The type of error is indicated by the reason-code:
v 8 for length exception (for example, expansion required for PC MIXED data exceeds the maximum length of the
string).
v 12 for invalid code-point (for example, use of the ERRORBYTE option of SYSSTRINGS).
v 16 for form exception (for example, invalid MIXED data).
v 20 for conversion procedure error (for example, an exit set the length control field of the string to an invalid
value). You can find the procedure name in SYSIBM.SYSSTRINGS row with INCCSID=source-ccsid and
OUTCCSID=target-ccsid in the TRANSPROC column.
The position-number, if provided (non-zero), is the ordinality of the output variable in the SQLDA.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Take one of the following actions based on the reason-code:
8 Extend the maximum length of the result column to allow for the expansion that occurs when the string is
converted.
12 Change the conversion table to accept the code-point, or change the data to eliminate the code-point.
16 If the string is described as MIXED data, change its description or change the string to conform to the rules
for well-formed MIXED data.
20 Correct the conversion procedure.
An alternative to these corrective actions is to provide an indicator variable so that a null value and a warning can be
returned rather than an error.

-332 CHARACTER CONVERSION BETWEEN CCSID from-ccsid TO to-ccsid REQUESTED BY reason-code IS NOT SUPPORTED
Explanation: The operation required a conversion between two different CCSIDs. No conversion support was found.
from-ccsid
Identifies the coded character set of the string to be converted.
to-ccsid Identifies the coded character set to which it must be converted.
reason-code
Describes the reason codes returned from DB2. Reason codes returned from DB2 begin with 'DSN' and
identify the context in which the conversion was requested. Values other than those that start with 'DSN' are
returned from other DB2 platforms and are described in the documentation for the platform.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If the conversion request is correct, see the information about how to add conversion
support.

-333 THE SUBTYPE OF A STRING VARIABLE IS NOT THE SAME AS THE SUBTYPE KNOWN AT BIND TIME AND THE DIFFERENCE CANNOT BE RESOLVED BY CHARACTER CONVERSION
Explanation: The CCSID in the run time SQLDA is inconsistent with the bind time subtype of the host variable or
parameter marker. Either the run time description is BIT and the bind time description was not BIT, or the run time
description is not BIT and the bind time description was BIT.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the CCSID in the SQLDA so that the subtype of the host variable is consistent with
the bind time subtype of the host variable or parameter marker. If the input data in error is a parameter marker, you
can use the DESCRIBE INPUT SQL statement to determine the expected SQLTYPE, SQLLEN and CCSID expected.

-336 THE SCALE OF THE DECIMAL NUMBER MUST BE ZERO
Explanation: The decimal number is used in a context where the scale must be zero. This can occur when a decimal
number is specified in a CREATE or ALTER SEQUENCE statement for START WITH, INCREMENT BY, MINVALUE,
MAXVALUE, or RESTART WITH.
Programmer response: Change the decimal number so that there are no non-zero digits to the right of the decimal
point.
SQLSTATE: 428FA
-338 AN ON CLAUSE IS INVALID
Explanation: A statement contains an invalid ON clause. Conditions that can cause this error include, but are not
limited to, violations of the following requirements:
v For a full join, each expression of the predicate must reference only columns in its own operand tables.
v Only VALUE and COALESCE functions are allowed in the ON clause for full outer joins and full joins.
v Full outer joins and full joins permit only the = operator.
v The ON clause cannot contain a subquery.
v The ON clause cannot contain an XMLEXISTS predicate.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the syntax, and reissue the statement.

-340 THE COMMON TABLE EXPRESSION name HAS THE SAME IDENTIFIER AS ANOTHER OCCURRENCE OF A COMMON TABLE EXPRESSION DEFINITION WITHIN THE SAME STATEMENT
Explanation: The common table expression name name is used in the definition of more than one common table
expressions in the statement. The name used to describe a common table expression must be unique within the same
statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the error by changing the name of one of the common table expressions.
SQLSTATE: 42726
-341 A CYCLIC REFERENCE EXISTS BETWEEN THE COMMON TABLE EXPRESSIONS name1 AND name2
Explanation: The common table expression name1 refers to name2 in a FROM clause within its fullselect and name2
refers to name1 in a FROM clause within its fullselects. Such forms of cyclic references are not allowed.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Remove the cyclic reference from one of the common table expressions.
SQLSTATE: 42835
-342 THE COMMON TABLE EXPRESSION name MUST NOT USE SELECT DISTINCT AND MUST USE UNION ALL BECAUSE IT IS RECURSIVE
Explanation: There are two possible explanations:
v A fullselect within the common table expression name cannot start with SELECT DISTINCT because the common
table expression is recursive.
v A fullselect within the common table expression name specified UNION instead of UNION ALL as required for
recursive common table expressions.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Remove the keyword DISTINCT from the common table expression, add the keyword ALL
following UNION, or remove the recursive reference within the common table expression.
SQLSTATE: 42925
-343 THE COLUMN NAMES ARE REQUIRED FOR THE RECURSIVE COMMON TABLE EXPRESSION name
Explanation: The recursive common table expression name name must include the specification of the column names
following the identifier of the common table expression.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Add column names following the identifier of the common table expressions.
SQLSTATE: 42908
-344 THE RECURSIVE COMMON TABLE EXPRESSION name HAS MISMATCHED DATA TYPES OR LENGTHS OR CODE PAGE FOR COLUMN column-name
Explanation: The recursive common table expression name name has a column column-name that is referred to in the
iterative fullselect of the common table expression. The data type and length are set based on the initialization
fullselect for this column. The result of the expression for the column column-name in the iterative fullselect has a
different data type or length that may result in failure to assign the value for the column.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the column used in the fullselects of the recursive common table expression so that
the initialization column matches the iterative columns.
SQLSTATE: 42825
-345 THE FULLSELECT OF THE RECURSIVE COMMON TABLE EXPRESSION name MUST BE A UNION ALL AND MUST NOT INCLUDE AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS, GROUP BY CLAUSE, HAVING CLAUSE, OR AN EXPLICIT JOIN INCLUDING AN ON CLAUSE
Explanation: The common table expression name includes a reference to itself and therefore:
v must be the union of two or more fullselects.
v cannot include a GROUP BY clause.
v cannot have aggregate functions.
v cannot include a HAVING clause.
v and cannot include an explicit join with an ON clause.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the common table expression by:
v making it a union of two or more fullselects.
v removing any aggregate functions, GROUP BY clause, HAVING clause, or explicit JOIN including an ON clause.
v removing the recursive reference.
SQLSTATE: 42836
-346 AN INVALID REFERENCE TO COMMON TABLE EXPRESSION name OCCURS IN THE FIRST FULLSELECT, AS A SECOND OCCURRENCE IN THE SAME FROM CLAUSE, OR IN THE FROM CLAUSE OF A SUBQUERY
Explanation: The common table expression name includes an invalid reference to itself as described by one of the
following:
v A recursive reference in the first fullselect before the UNION ALL set operator. The first fullselect must be an
initialization and cannot include a recursive reference.
v More than one reference to the same common table expression in the same FROM clause. Such references are not
permitted in recursive common table expression.
v A recursive reference in the FROM clause of a subquery. A recursion cycle cannot be defined using a subquery.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change one of the following:
v the fullselect prior to the union operator so that it does not include a recursive reference.
v the FROM clause containing more than one reference to the same common table expression to just one reference .
v the FROM clause of the subquery so that it does not reference the common table expression.
SQLSTATE: 42836
-348 sequence-expression CANNOT BE SPECIFIED IN THIS CONTEXT
Explanation: The statement contains a NEXT VALUE expression or PREVIOUS VALUE expression in an invalid
context.
The NEXT VALUE expression or PREVIOUS VALUE expression cannot be specified in the following contexts:
v Join condition of a full outer join
v DEFAULT value for a column in a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement
v Column definition that is generated in a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement
v Materialized query table definition in a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement
v An as-result-table clause of a CREATE TABLE or DECLARED GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE statement.
v Condition of a CHECK constraint
v Input value-specification for LOAD
v CREATE VIEW statement
v Key-expression of an index definition.
v The SELECT list of a subselect that contains a NOT ATOMIC data change statement.
The NEXT VALUE expressions cannot be specified in the following contexts:
v CASE expression
v Parameter list of an aggregate function
v Subquery in a context in which it is not otherwise allowed
v SELECT statement for which the outer SELECT contains a DISTINCT operator or a GROUP BY clause
v SELECT statement for which the outer SELECT is combined with another SELECT statement using a set operator
such as UNION, EXCEPT, or INTERSECT
v Join condition of a join
v Nested table expression
v Parameter list of a table function
v SELECT clause of the fullselect of an expression in the SET clause of an UPDATE statement
v ORDER BY clause in the SELECT statement
v ORDER BY clause in an OLAP specification
v IF, WHILE, DO ... UNTIL, or CASE statement in an SQL routine
v Key-expression of an index definition.
v The SELECT list of a subselect that contains a NOT ATOMIC data change statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Remove the reference to the sequence expression and resubmit the statement.

Hidden columns
A hidden column cannot be specified in a key expression for an index.
Result table columns
v A ROWID, LOB, or XML data type cannot be the data type of a column in the result table of an
as-result-table clause of a CREATE TABLE or DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE statement.
v A security label column column-name exists in the result table of the as-result-table clause; however, it is not
the only security label column in that result table. A table can be defined only with a single security label
column.
Security label columns
A security label column cannot be:
v Specified as a column of a foreign key in a referential-constraint clause.
v Specified in a REFERENCES clause.
v Specified in a key expression for an index.
Timestamp with time zone columns
A timestamp with time zone column cannot be specified as a column of a partitioning key for range
partitioning.
VARBINARY columns
A VARBINARY column can not be specified as a column of an index key when DESC is also specified.
XML columns
An XML column cannot be:
v Specified as a column of the primary key in a PRIMARY KEY clause.
v Specified as a column of a UNIQUE KEY.
v Specified as a column of a foreign key in a referential-constraint clause.
v Specified as a column of a parent key in a REFERENCES clause.
v Specified as a column of a partitioning key for range partitioning.
v Defined in a temporary table (created global temporary table or declared global temporary table).
v Defined in a table that has an edit procedure that is defined with row attribute sensitivity.
v Specified as a column of an index key. Additionally, the result data type, including the intermediate result,
of a key expression for an index cannot be an XML data type. For an XML index, only XML columns can
be specified, and the result type of the index key can be DECFLOAT.
v Specified with the SET DEFAULT or DROP DEFAULT clause.
v Referenced by the definition of a column mask or a row permission.
v Defined as a column mask.
v Specified as a column in a CREATE TABLE ORGANIZE BY HASH or ALTER TABLE ADD ORGANIZE
BY HASH statement.
DOCID columns
A DOCID column cannot be specified in the following:
v An ALTER TABLE statement in an ALTER COLUMN clause.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the syntax, and resubmit the statement.
SQLSTATE: 42962
-351 AN UNSUPPORTED SQLTYPE WAS ENCOUNTERED IN POSITION position-number OF THE SELECT-LIST
Explanation:
position-number
The position of the first element in the SQLDA with an unsupported data type.
This error can occur when an application requestor or application server does not have support for this type.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the statement to exclude the unsupported data type. For a select statement, remove
the names of any columns in the select-list with the unsupported data types.
SQLSTATE: 56084
-352 AN UNSUPPORTED SQLTYPE WAS ENCOUNTERED IN POSITION position-number OF THE INPUT-LIST
Explanation: The input SQLDA for an OPEN, EXECUTE, FETCH, or CALL statement contains an unsupported
SQLTYPE for a parameter.
position-number
The position of the first element in the SQLDA with an unsupported data type.
Either the application requestor or the application server does not have support for this data type. This error can
occur only in a client/server environment.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the SQLDA to exclude the unsupported data type.
SQLSTATE: 56084
-353 FETCH IS NOT ALLOWED, BECAUSE CURSOR cursor-name HAS AN UNKNOWN POSITION
Explanation: The cursor position for cursor-name is unknown. The previous multiple-row-fetch for cursor cursor-name
resulted in an error in the middle of processing multiple rows that were retrieved from DB2. One or more of the
requested rows could not be returned to the program following the error, leaving the position of the cursor unknown.
The error might have been detected at the requester. For example, a row with a null value was returned to an
application, but no indicator variable was provided. A subsequent FETCH statement would result in SQLCODE -353.
If an indicator had been provided, a positive SQLCODE would have been returned and all of the rows retrieved from
DB2 could have been returned to the application program.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The cursor position is not changed.
Programmer response: Close and reopen the cursor to reset the cursor position. For scrollable cursors, you can
change the FETCH statement to specify one of the other fetch orientations. For example, you can modify the FETCH
statement by specifying one of the following fetch orientations:
v BEFORE or AFTER
v row-positioned fetch orientations: FIRST, LAST, or ABSOLUTE to establish a valid row cursor and fetch a row of
data
v rowset-positioned fetch orientations: FIRST ROWSET, LAST ROWSET, or ROWSET STARTING AT ABSOLUTE to
establish a valid rowset cursor position and fetch multiple rows of data
Alternately, change the application to correct the error that originally occurred. For example, if the error was issued
because an indicator was not provided, change the application to provide an indicator.
SQLSTATE: 24513
-354 A ROWSET FETCH STATEMENT MAY HAVE RETURNED ONE OR MORE ROWS OF DATA.  HOWEVER, ONE OR MORE NON-TERMINATING ERROR CONDITIONS WERE ENCOUNTERED. USE THE GET DIAGNOSTICS STATEMENT FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE CONDITIONS THAT WERE ENCOUNTERED
Explanation: A rowset FETCH statement encountered one or more non-terminating error conditions. One or more
warnings might also have been encountered. Use the GET DIAGNOSTICS statement to obtain information about the
conditions that occurred, and to determine if data was returned. It is possible that one or more rows of data were
returned. In cases where the row information returned for the row that encountered the condition is incomplete, use
of the data for the row that encountered the condition, such as displaying or printing the data, is not recommended.
System action: DB2 processed the statement successfully, but with at least one non-terminating error. Additionally,
the fetching of some rows might have encountered warnings.
Programmer response: Analyze the conditions to determine whether follow-up actions are needed. The GET
DIAGNOSTICS statement can be used to determine which additional actions might be necessary.
Attention: It is possible that an end of data condition was detected. SQLERRD3 and GET DIAGNOSTICS can be
used to determine if all the requested rows were fetched or if a partial rowset was returned.
SQLSTATE: 22537
-355 A LOB COLUMN IS TOO LARGE TO BE LOGGED
Explanation: One of the following has occurred:
v a CREATE TABLE statement for an auxiliary table stores a BLOB, CLOB or DBCLOB column whose length exceeds
1 gigabyte but whose associated LOB table space was defined with the LOG YES attribute
v an ALTER TABLESPACE statement of a LOB table space specifies the LOG YES clause but the auxiliary table in the
LOB table space stores a BLOB or CLOB column whose length exceeds 1 gigabyte or a DBCLOB column whose
length exceeds 500 megabyte characters
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Either change the attribute of the LOB table space to LOG NO or drop the base table, and
re-create it with columns of an acceptable length for logging.
SQLSTATE: 42993
-356 KEY EXPRESSION expression-number IS NOT VALID, REASON CODE = reason-code
Explanation: The CREATE INDEX statement cannot be processed because a key expression is not valid.
expression-number
The number of the invalid key expression.
reason-code
A numeric value that indicates the reason for the failure.
1 Contains a subquery.
2 Does not contain at least one reference to a column.
3 References a special register.
4 Includes a CASE expression.
5 Includes a user-defined function.
6 Appears more than once in the index.
7 References a qualified column name.
8 References a column that is defined with a FIELDPROC.
9 References the LOWER or UPPER function without a locale name or the input string-expression is
FOR BIT DATA.
10 References the TRANSLATE function without an output translation table.
11 The encoding scheme of the result of a key-expression is different than the CCSID encoding scheme
of the table, or some of the keys (columns or key expressions) are not Unicode.
12 The built-in function is allowed to reference the inline portion of a LOB column in the specified
context. In addition, the START and LENGTH arguments of the SUBSTR function must be
constants.
13 References one of the following built-in functions:
v VERIFY_GROUP_FOR_USER
v VERIFY_TRUSTED_CONTEXT_ ROLE_FOR_USER
v VERIFY_ROLE_FOR_USER.
14 Contains an expression that requires the use of an implicit time zone value. For example, the key
expression might include an explicit cast of a TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE value to a
TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE value.
 116 The expression must end in ':na'.
 117 The expression is a function invocation for which the first argument is a column that is contained
in a table that is not in a partitioned by growth table space. In the specified context, the argument
must be column that is contained in a table that is in a partitioned by growth table space.
 118 The expression is a function invocation for which the first argument is a LOB column, and the
statement is a CREATE INDEX statement that references another LOB column. In this context only
a single LOB column can be referenced.
 119 The expression is a function invocation for which the function invocation must be the outermost expression for the key expression.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the error in the key expression, and reissue the statement.
SQLSTATE: 429BX
-359 THE RANGE OF VALUES FOR THE IDENTITY COLUMN OR SEQUENCE IS EXHAUSTED
Explanation: DB2 attempted to generate a value for an identity column or a sequence object. However, all allowable
values have already been assigned.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Take one of the following actions:
v For an identity column, redefine the table with a larger range of values for the identity column. If a MAXVALUE
or MINVALUE specification has been made that limits the range of values to be less than the range for the data
type of the column, then the column can be altered to expand the range of valid values. Otherwise, the identity
column must be re-created, which requires that the table be re-created. First, drop the existing table; then, re-create
the table with a different data type for the identity column, specifying a data type that has a larger range of values
than the current data type for the identity column.
v For a sequence object, redefine the sequence with a larger range of values. If a MAXVALUE or MINVALUE
specification has been made that limits the range of values to be less than the range for the data type, then the
sequence can be altered to expand the range of valid values. Otherwise, the sequence must be re-created using
DROP SEQUENCE and CREATE SEQUENCE to cover a larger range of values.
SQLSTATE: 23522
-363 THE EXTENDED INDICATOR VARIABLE VALUE FOR PARAMETER position-number IS OUT OF RANGE.
Explanation: The extended indicator variable value is invalid.
position-number
The ordinal position of parameter marker.
When extended indicator variables are enabled, all negative input indicator variable values must be in the -1 to -7
(inclusive) range.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
System programmer response: Correct the value, and reissue the statement.
SQLSTATE: 22010
-365 USE OF THE VALUE OF EXTENDED INDICATOR VARIABLE IN POSITION value-position IS NOT VALID.
Explanation: The value of DEFAULT (-5) or UNASSIGNED (-7) was used for the extended indicator variable in a
context where it is not allowed. These values are allowed as indicator variables only in INSERT, UPDATE, and
MERGE statements when the host variable provides the source value for a column value.
value-position
Identifies the location of the extended indicator variable value.
When extended indicator variables are enabled:
v An expression must not be more complex than a reference to a single host variable if the indicator is set to the
extended indicator values of DEFAULT (-5) or UNASSIGNED (-7), except that a CAST specification is allowed
when the following conditions are met:
¨C The source of the CAST specification is a single host variable.
¨C The data attributes (data type, length, precision, and scale) of the host variable are the same as the result of the
cast specification.
v The extended indicator variable values of DEFAULT (-5) or UNASSIGNED (-7) must not be used in:
¨C An expression that involves more than a host variable, or a host variable that is explicitly cast.
¨C Any expression other than:
- The set assignment list of an UPDATE operation.
- The values list of an INSERT operation.
- The expression's corresponding places in a MERGE statement.
- The source-table parameter of a MERGE statement.
- The select list of an INSERT statement in the FROM clause of the SELECT statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
System programmer response: Change the value of the extended indicator variable to an allowable value for the
context in which it is used

The name of the function.
specific-name
The specific name. If specific-name is an empty string, then the function resolved to the built-in function
identified by function-name.
Possible causes for this error include:
v A scalar or aggregate function is referenced where only a table function is allowed (such as in the FROM clause of
a query).
v A table function is referenced where only a scalar or aggregate function is allowed (such as in an expression, or in
a SOURCE clause of a CREATE FUNCTION statement).
v Function XMLMODIFY is referenced where it is not the topmost expression on the right side of the SET
assignment clause in an update.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Ensure that the correct function name and arguments are specified and that the SQL path
includes the schema where the correct function is defined. You might need to change the function name, arguments,
or SQL path (using SET CURRENT PATH or the PATH bind option), or change the context in which the function is
used.

-392 SQLDA PROVIDED FOR CURSOR cursor-name HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS FETCH (reason-code)
Explanation: The application has requested incompatible returns from successive FETCH statements.
cursor-name
The name of the cursor.
reason-code
A numeric value that indicates the reason for the failure. Possible values are:
1 The application is running with DB2 rules, and has requested that LOB data be returned as a LOB
in one FETCH statement, and as a locator in another FETCH statement. This request is not
permitted.
2 The application has requested textual XML in one FETCH statement, and binary XML in another
FETCH statement. This request is not permitted.
If the cursor is a result set returned by a stored procedure called by the application, then the application error might
result from a mismatch with the last FETCH performed by the stored procedure.
System action: The statement is not processed, and the connection is terminated.
Programmer response: Take the action that corresponds to the reason-code value:
1 For a mismatch involving LOB and locator: Either do not use DB2 rules, or modify the application so that it
does not change the data type code from LOB to locator (or the reverse) in the SQLDA between successive
fetches.
2 For a mismatch involving textual XML and binary XML: Change the application to request textual XML data
in successive fetches, or to request binary XML data in successive fetches.

-397 GENERATED IS SPECIFIED AS PART OF A COLUMN DEFINITION, BUT IT IS NOT VALID FOR THE DEFINITION OF THE COLUMN
Explanation: In a CREATE TABLE statement or ALTER TABLE statement, GENERATED was specified for a column
type that does not support generated values. GENERATED can be specified only for a column with one of the
following data types:
v Row ID
v Distinct type that is based on a row ID
v Row change timestamp
v Identity column
v Row-begin column
v Row-end column
v Transaction-start-ID column
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the statement. Either remove the GENERATED clause or change the definition of the
column to one of the types that can be generated.

-398 A LOCATOR WAS REQUESTED FOR HOST VARIABLE NUMBER position-number BUT THE VARIABLE IS NOT A LOB
Explanation: The application requested that a locator be returned from host variable number position-number. A
locator can only be used with LOB data, and the requested data is not a LOB.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the statement to either return LOB data, or change the target host variable to not be
a locator.
SQLSTATE: 428D2
-399 INVALID VALUE ROWID WAS SPECIFIED
Explanation: When inserting into a table, a value specified for a ROWID column was invalid. Only row ID values
previously generated by DB2 are valid.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
System programmer response: Do not attempt to generate any value into a ROWID column. Insertion into ROWID
columns is supported for purposes of Data Propagation, where DB2 has previously generated the row ID values.
Only row ID values previously generated by DB2 can be used as values for insertion into a row ID column.
Alternatively, insert the row specifying DEFAULT for the ROWID column or remove the ROWID column from the
insert column-list.
You could also use the OVERRIDING clause as a possible solution for this situation. See INSERT in DB2 SQL
Reference for more information about the OVERRIDING USER VALUE clause.
SQLSTATE: 22511
-400 THE CATALOG HAS THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF USER DEFINED INDEXES
Explanation: No more than 500 user-defined indexes can be created in the catalog database.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If this index must be created, another user-defined index on the catalog must be dropped.
After that index is dropped, this statement can be executed.
SQLSTATE: 54027
-401 THE DATA TYPES OF THE OPERANDS OF AN OPERATION ARE NOT COMPATIBLE
Explanation: An operation cannot be processed for one of the following reasons:
v The data types of the operands must be compatible but at least one pair of data types is not compatible.
v An operation contains a mixture of numeric and non-numeric operands.
v One of the operands is a column defined with a field procedure, and another column operand is not defined with
the same field procedure. If one column of arithmetic or comparison operation is defined with a field procedure,
other columns in the operation must be defined with the same field procedure.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Check the data types of all operands to ensure that their data types are comparable and
compatible with their usage in the statement.
If all the operands of the SQL statement are correct, then, if a view is being accessed, check the data types of all the
operands in the view definition.
SQLSTATE: 42818
-402 AN ARITHMETIC FUNCTION OR OPERATOR function-operator IS APPLIED TO CHARACTER OR DATETIME DATA
Explanation: An invalid operand has been specified for the arithmetic function or operator.
function-operator
The name of the arithmetic function or operator.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Examine and correct the syntax of the SQL statement so that all operands of the specified
function or operator are valid. A valid operand is either numeric, or is capable of being implicitly cast to a numeric
data type.
SQLSTATE: 42819
-404 THE SQL STATEMENT SPECIFIES A STRING THAT IS TOO LONG
Explanation: An INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, CALL, VALUES INTO, SET, parameter, host variable, or transition
variable statement specifies a value that is longer than the maximum length string that can be stored in the target
column or index key.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Check the length of the target column, parameter, host variable, transition variable, or index
key and correct the program or SQL statement so that the length of the string does not exceed that maximum. For
example, you could use the SUBSTR function to shorten the string.
SQLSTATE: 22001
-405 THE NUMERIC CONSTANT constant CANNOT BE USED AS SPECIFIED BECAUSE IT IS OUT OF RANGE
Explanation: The numeric constant is not in the proper range.
The proper ranges for SQL values are as follows:
v 5.4E-79 to 7.2E+75 for FLOAT values
v -(1031 -1) to +(1031 -1) for DECIMAL values
v -2147483648 to 2147483647 for INTEGER values
v -32768 to +32767 for small integer (SMALLINT) values
v -9.999999999999999x10-383 to 9.999999999999999x10384 for DECFLOAT(16) values
v -9.999999999999999999999999999999999x10-6143 to 9.999999999999999999999999999999999x106144 for DECFLOAT(34)
values
v - 9223372036854775808 to +9223372036854775807 for big integer (BIGINT) values
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: The value of constant should be reduced to the appropriate size for this data type.
SQLSTATE: 42820
-406 A CALCULATED OR DERIVED NUMERIC VALUE IS NOT WITHIN THE RANGE OF ITS OBJECT COLUMN
Explanation: A value derived or calculated during processing of the SQL statement was outside the range of the
data type of its object column. This problem might have arisen for one of the following reasons:
v The values occurring in the object column were out of range.
v The SQL operation performed was not appropriate for the values in the object column.
v A DECIMAL(19,0) column is altered to BIGINT, but a value in the column is outside the range of BIGINT.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: See the explanation of SQLCODE -405 for allowed ranges for numeric data types.
If the error occurred while accessing a table column that was altered from DECIMAL(19,0) to BIGINT, alter the
column data type back to DECIMAL(19,0) and refer description of the ALTER TABLE statement for information
about how to change DECIMAL(19,0) columns to BIGINT.

-407 AN UPDATE, INSERT, OR SET VALUE IS NULL, BUT THE OBJECT COLUMN column-name CANNOT CONTAIN NULL VALUES
Explanation: One of the following conditions occurred:
v A null insert or update value was specified for a column defined as NOT NULL.
v A SET transition variable statement specified a NULL value for column defined as NOT NULL without the WITH
DEFAULT clause in the table definition.
v The update or insert value was DEFAULT, but the object column was declared as NOT NULL without WITH
DEFAULT in the table definition. Consequently:
¨C A default value of NULL cannot be inserted into that column.
¨C An update cannot set default values of NULL in that column.
¨C A SET transition variable statement in a trigger cannot set default values of NULL in that column.
v The column name list for the INSERT statement omits a column declared NOT NULL and without WITH
DEFAULT in the table definition.
v The view for the INSERT statement omits a column declared NOT NULL and without WITH DEFAULT in the
base table definition.
v A null insert value was specified for a ROWID column.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The 'column-name' might be returned in the SQLCA, depending
on the syntax of the SQL statement in which the error was detected.
Programmer response: Examine the definition of the object table to determine which columns of the table have the
NOT NULL attribute or have a type of ROWID, and correct the SQL statement accordingly.
SQLSTATE: 23502
-408 THE VALUE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE DATA TYPE OF ITS TARGET. TARGET NAME IS name
Explanation: A statement failed required assignment rule checking.
name The name of the target of the assignment.
The data type that is to be assigned is incompatible with the declared data type of the assignment target. Both data
types must be:
v Numeric or character
v Character (see restriction)
v Graphic (see restriction)
v Dates or character (see restriction)
v Times or character (see restriction)
v Timestamps or character (see restriction)
v Row IDs
v The same distinct types
v XML
v Result set locator
v Table locator
Restrictions:
v Dates, times, and timestamps cannot be assigned to a character column that has a field procedure.
v Character and graphic data types are compatible when using Unicode.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Examine the SQL statement and the current definition for the object table, procedure,
user-defined function, host variable, or SQL variable, and ensure that the variable, constant, or result of an expression
that is assigned to the object has the proper data type.
If the target is a result set locator, the application might have tried to explicitly assign an invalid locator value to a
result set locator. Use the ASSOCIATE LOCATORS statement to get a valid locator value for a result set into a locator
variable. Then, reference the result set locator in an ALLOCATE CURSOR statement.
SQLSTATE: 42821
-409 INVALID OPERAND OF A COUNT FUNCTION
Explanation: The operand of the COUNT or COUNT_BIG function in the statement violates SQL syntax. A common
error is a column name or other expression without DISTINCT.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the syntax and resubmit the statement.

-410 A NUMERIC VALUE value IS TOO LONG, OR IT HAS A VALUE THAT IS NOT WITHIN THE RANGE OF ITS DATA TYPE
Explanation: The specified value is too long. A floating-point string has a maximum length of 30 characters. A
decimal floating-point string has a maximum length of 42 characters.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the indicated string value.
SQLSTATE: 42820
-412 THE SELECT CLAUSE OF A SUBQUERY SPECIFIES MULTIPLE COLUMNS
Explanation: In the context in which it was used in the SQL statement, the subquery can have only one column
specified in its SELECT clause.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the syntax of the SQL statement.

-413 OVERFLOW OR UNDERFLOW OCCURRED DURING NUMERIC DATA TYPE CONVERSION
Explanation: During processing of the SQL statement, an overflow or underflow condition arose when converting
from one numeric type to another. Numeric conversion is performed according to the standard rules of SQL.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No data was retrieved, updated, or deleted.
Programmer response: Examine the syntax of the SQL statement to determine the cause of the error. If the problem
is data-dependent, it might be necessary to examine the data processed at the time of the error.
SQLSTATE: 22003
-414 A LIKE PREDICATE IS INVALID BECAUSE THE FIRST OPERAND IS NOT A STRING
Explanation: The data type of the first operand of the LIKE predicate must be a character string, graphic string, or
binary string.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Specify the predicate so that the data type of each operand is a character string or a graphic
string.
SQLSTATE: 42824
-415 THE CORRESPONDING COLUMNS, column-number, OF THE OPERANDS OF A SET OPERATOR ARE NOT COMPATIBLE
Explanation: The data types of the corresponding columns of a UNION, EXCEPT, or INTERSECT set operator are
not compatible, or the corresponding columns do not have the same field procedure. The relative position of the
value in the select list is column-number.
This error is issued if one of the columns is a distinct type, and the other column is not a distinct type, or the other
column is a different distinct type. This error code is also issued if one column is defined with a field procedure, and
the other column is not defined with the same field procedure. If corresponding columns have field procedures, they
must both be defined with the same field procedure.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Check the data types of the specified columns and correct the statement containing the set
operator to ensure that all corresponding columns have comparable column descriptions. A CAST specification can
be used to make the data type of the columns compatible.

-416 AN OPERAND OF A SET OPERATOR CONTAINS A LONG STRING COLUMN
Explanation: The UNION, EXCEPT, or INTERSECT set operator that you specified in the SQL statement could not
be performed because one of the tables participating in the union contains a long string column. The operands of a
set operator that does not include the ALL keyword cannot contain long string columns.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.

Explanation: The statement string specified as the object of a PREPARE contains a predicate or expression where
parameter markers have been used as operands of the same operator¡ªfor example: ? > ?
This syntax is not permitted.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.

PREPARE (DB2 SQL)
-418 A STATEMENT STRING TO BE PREPARED CONTAINS AN INVALID USE OF PARAMETER MARKERS
Explanation: The statement cannot be executed because a parameter marker has been used in an invalid way.
Parameter markers cannot be used:
v In the SELECT list as the sole argument of a scalar function.
v In a concatenation operation.
v In the string expression of an EXECUTE IMMEDIATE SQL statement.
v In a result-expression in any CASE expression when all the other result-expressions are either NULL or untyped
parameter markers.
v In a key-expression of an index definition.
Untyped parameter markers cannot be used:
v As an argument to an XMLQUERY function.
v As an argument to an XMLEXISTS predicate.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the logic of the application program so that this error does not occur. See the
discussion of the PREPARE statement for information about the proper usage of parameter markers within SQL
statements and for EXECUTE IMMEDIATE SQL statement restrictions.

-419 THE DECIMAL DIVIDE OPERATION IS INVALID BECAUSE THE RESULT WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE SCALE
Explanation: The decimal division is invalid because it will result in a negative scale.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No data was retrieved, updated, or deleted.
Programmer response: Examine the precision and scale of all columns that might have participated in a decimal
division. Note that an integer or small integer value might have been converted to decimal for this calculation.
A YES value for the DECDIV3 subsystem parameter specifies that the scale of the result of a decimal division is
never less than 3.

-420 THE VALUE OF A STRING ARGUMENT WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO THE function-name FUNCTION
Explanation: A string argument did not conform to the requirements of the function. For example, a character string
passed to the DECIMAL function did not conform to the rules for forming an SQL integer or decimal constant.
If the error is issued for an implicit or explicit cast, the function-name token contains the name of the cast's target data
type. For implicit cast where a character-string or graphic-string value is compared with a numeric value, DB2
implicitly converts the string value to DECFLOAT(34) so the function-name function will have a DECFLOAT value.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the argument value so that it conforms to the requirements of the function.
SQLSTATE: 22018

-421 THE OPERANDS OF A SET OPERATOR DO NOT HAVE THE SAME NUMBER OF COLUMNS
Explanation: The operands of a set operator, such as UNION, EXCEPT, or INTERSECT, must have the same number
of columns.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the SQL statement so that there are exactly the same number of columns.
SQLSTATE: 42826
-423 INVALID VALUE FOR LOCATOR IN POSITION position-#
Explanation: The value specified in a result set locator host variable, a LOB locator host variable, or a table locator
that is specified at position position-# in the locator variable list of the SQL statement does not identify a valid result
set locator, LOB locator variable, or table locator, respectively.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: For a result set locator there are two common causes for the error:
v The host variable used as a result set locator was never assigned a valid result set locator value. Result set locator
values are returned by the DESCRIBE PROCEDURE and ASSOCIATE LOCATORS statements. Make sure the value
in your host variable is obtained from one of these statements.
v Result set locator values are only valid as long as the underlying SQL cursor is open. If a commit or rollback
operation closes an SQL cursor, the result set locator associated with the cursor is no longer valid.
For a LOB locator, some common causes for the error are:
v The host variable used as a LOB locator was never assigned a valid LOB value.
v A commit or rollback operation or an SQL FREE LOCATOR statement freed the locator.
For a table locator, the error commonly occurs when the host variable that was used as a table locator was never
assigned a valid table locator value.
SQLSTATE: 0F001
-426 DYNAMIC COMMIT NOT VALID AT AN APPLICATION SERVER WHERE UPDATES ARE NOT ALLOWED
Explanation: An application executing using DRDA protocols has attempted to issue a dynamic COMMIT
statement, or a stored procedure has attempted to issue a COMMIT_ON_RETURN, while connected to a location at
which updates are not allowed. A dynamic COMMIT or COMMIT_ON_RETURN can be issuedonly while connected
to a location at which updates are allowed.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No COMMIT is performed.
Programmer response: The IMS or CICS protocols should be used to commit work in these environments.
SQLSTATE: 2D528
-427 DYNAMIC ROLLBACK NOT VALID AT AN APPLICATION SERVER WHERE UPDATES ARE NOT ALLOWED
Explanation: An application executing using DRDA protocols has attempted to issue a dynamic ROLLBACK
statement while connected to a location at which updates are not allowed. A dynamic ROLLBACK may be issued
only while connected to a location at which updates are allowed.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No ROLLBACK is performed.
Programmer response: The IMS or CICS protocols should be used to rollback work in these environments.
SQLSTATE: 2D529
-430 routine-type routine-name (SPECIFIC NAME specific-name) HAS ABNORMALLY TERMINATED
Explanation: An abnormal termination has occurred while the routine routine-name (stored procedure or function)
was in control.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: The stored procedure or function needs to be fixed. Contact the author of the routine or your
database administrator. Until it is fixed, the routine should not be used.

Explanation: A user has issued TERMINATE during a debugging session of SQL routine routine-name. The
TERMINATE might have been issued because an infinite wait or loop was encountered.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: No recovery is necessary.
SQLSTATE: 38504
-433 VALUE value IS TOO LONG
Explanation: The value value required truncation by a system (built-in) cast or adjustment function, which was
called to transform the value in some way. The truncation is not allowed where this value is used. The value being
transformed is one of the following:
v an argument to a user defined function (UDF)
v an input to the SET clause of an UPDATE statement
v a value being INSERTed into a table
v an input to a cast or adjustment function in some other context.
If value has the 'for bit data' subtype, or has a data type of BINARY or VARBINARY, then the value is printed as a
hexadecimal string in quotes followed by an X.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If value is a literal string in the SQL statement, it is too long for its intended use. If value is
not a literal string, examine the SQL statement to determine where the transformation is taking place. Either the
input to the transformation is too long, or the target is too short. Correct the problem and rerun the statement.
SQLSTATE: 22001
-435 AN INVALID SQLSTATE sqlstate IS SPECIFIED IN A RAISE_ERROR FUNCTION, RESIGNAL STATEMENT, OR SIGNAL STATEMENT
Explanation: The SQLSTATE specified in the RAISE_ERROR function, RESIGNAL statement, or SIGNAL statement
of a trigger or a routine does not conform to the rules for a valid SQLSTATE.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the SQLSTATE specified in the RAISE_ERROR function, RESIGNAL statement, or
SIGNAL statement so that it conforms to the rules of the statement.
For the RAISE_ERROR function, the SQLSTATE must be a character string containing exactly five (5) characters. It
must be of type CHAR defined with a length of five (5), or, a type VARCHAR defined with a length of five (5) or
greater. The SQLSTATE value must conform to the following rules:
v Each character must be from the set of digits ('0' through '9') or non-accented upper case letters ('A' through 'Z').
v The SQLSTATE class (the first two characters) cannot be '00', '01' or '02' because these characters do not indicate
error classes.
v If the SQLSTATE class (the first two characters) start with the character '0' through '6' or 'A' through 'H', then the
subclass (the last three characters) must start with a letter in the range 'I' through 'Z'.
v If the SQLSTATE class (the first two characters) start with the character '7', '8', '9' or 'I' through 'Z', then the
subclass (the last three characters) must be from the set of characters '0' through '9' or 'A' through 'Z'.
For the RESIGNAL and SIGNAL statements, the SQLSTATE value must be exactly five (5) characters that follow the
following rules:
v Each character must be from the set of digits '0' through '9' or non-accented upper case letter 'A' through 'Z'.
v The SQLSTATE class (the first two characters) cannot be '00' because it represents successful completion.

-440 NO AUTHORIZED routine-type BY THE NAME routine-name HAVING COMPATIBLE ARGUMENTS WAS FOUND
Explanation: An attempt was made to invoke a routine, but DB2 could not resolve the invocation of a routine,
including the argument list, to a specific routine definition.
routine-type
The type of routine, such as FUNCTION or PROCEDURE.
routine-name or schema-name.routine-name
The name of the routine. If the originating statement references a qualified name, the routine name in the
message text is qualified by the name of the schema.
Possible causes for this error include:
v The routine name was either incorrectly specified or does not exist in the database.
v A qualified reference was used, and the schema qualifier was incorrectly specified.
v The user's SQL path does not contain the schema to which the function belongs, and an unqualified reference was
used.
v The wrong number of arguments was included.
v The right number of arguments was included in the routine reference, but the data type of one or more of the
arguments is incorrect.
v The invoker of the routine is not authorized to execute the routine.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Use the routine name identified in the message to find the invocation, and verify that the
invocation can be resolved to the intended routine, based on the function and procedure resolution processes.
v For functions: Function resolution (DB2 SQL)
v For procedures: CALL (DB2 SQL)
To ensure that the intended routine is invoked, specify a qualified routine name whenever possible.

-441 INVALID USE OF 'DISTINCT' OR 'ALL' WITH FUNCTION function-name
Explanation: This error can occur for the following situations:
v The keyword DISTINCT or ALL was detected within parentheses in a reference to function function-name and the
function has been resolved as a scalar function. Use of the keywords DISTINCT or ALL with the specified scalar
function is invalid.
v The keyword DISTINCT was detected within parentheses in a reference to function function-name and the function
has been resolved as an aggregate function. Use of the keywords DISTINCT with the specified aggregate function
is not valid.
v The function was expected to be an aggregate function supporting the keyword ALL or DISTINCT, but the
function that was resolved to is not an aggregate function.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Take the appropriate action:
v If a scalar function is being used, then remove the keyword DISTINCT or ALL.
v If the function is an aggregate function that does not support the DISTINCT or ALL keywords, then remove the
keyword.
v Otherwise, if an aggregate function is being used, then there is a problem with function resolution. Check your
SQL path to see if the function is in one of the schemas, and also check the SYSIBM.SYSROUTINES catalog for the
spelling of the function name and the number and types of parameters

System action: Execution of the SQL statement is terminated.
Programmer response: Contact the author of the routine or your database administrator. Until the problem is
resolved, the routine should not be used.
SQLSTATE: xxxxx (the SQLSTATE that was returned by the routine).
-444 USER PROGRAM name COULD NOT BE FOUND
Explanation: DB2 received an SQL CALL statement for a stored procedure or an SQL statement containing an
invocation of a user-defined function, and found the row in the SYSIBM.SYSROUTINES catalog table associated with
the requested procedure name. However, the MVS load module identified in the EXTERNAL_NAME column of the
SYSIBM.SYSROUTINES row could not be found.
name The name of the MVS load module that could not be found
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If the EXTERNAL_NAME column value in the SYSIBM.SYSROUTINES table is incorrect, use
the ALTER FUNCTION or ALTER PROCEDURE statement to correct the value.
If the EXTERNAL_NAME column value is correct, use the MVS linkage editor to create the required MVS load
module in one of the MVS load libraries used by your installation for stored procedures.
This error can also occur if you are invoking a WLM-managed stored procedure that is not APF authorized, and the
DB2 load libraries are not in the STEPLIB concatenation because they are being loaded from LINKLIST. In this case,
if you want the stored procedure program to run APF-authorized, link-edit it with AC=1 into an MVS APF
authorized library. If you do not want the stored procedure program to run APF authorized, add the DB2 load
library to the STEPLIB concatenation of the JCL used to start the WLM-managed address space.
SQLSTATE: 42724
-449 CREATE OR ALTER STATEMENT FOR FUNCTION OR PROCEDURE routine-name CONTAINS AN INVALID FORMAT OF THE EXTERNAL NAME CLAUSE OR IS MISSING THE EXTERNAL NAME CLAUSE
Explanation: An error was found in the EXTERNAL NAME clause of the CREATE FUNCTION, CREATE
PROCEDURE, ALTER FUNCTION, or ALTER PROCEDURE statement for routine-name, or the clause is needed but
was not specified.
v For external routines with LANGUAGE JAVA, the name must be specified and it must contain a valid
external-java-routine-name of the following form: jar-name:package-id...class-id.method-id(method-signature)
¨C No blanks are permitted within the single quotes.
¨C The method-name consists of the list of package-ids, class-id, and method-id, and must not be longer than 254 bytes.
¨C Zero or more package-ids can be specified, preceding the class-id.
¨C The method-signature is optional, and is a list of Java? data types that are separated by commas. If specified, the
method-signature must not be longer than 1024 bytes.
¨C If multiple strings are specified, the total length of all the strings concatenated together for the
external-java-routine-name must not be greater than 1305.
v For external routines with a language other than JAVA, the external name must be a short identifier with letters or
digits. The first character must be a letter (this is the MVS naming convention for load modules). A possible cause
for this error is the inclusion of a blank in the name.
If the clause is omitted, the external name defaults to function-name. However, for CREATE FUNCTION or
CREATE PROCEDURE, if the function or procedure name is longer than eight characters then the EXTERNAL
NAME clause must be explicitly specified to specify a valid short identifier as the external name.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: When LANGUAGE is JAVA, possible causes include:
v Omitting the EXTERNAL NAME clause.
v Including a blank.
v Having the '!' at the beginning or end of the name.
v Specifying an invalid external-java-routine-name.
Programmer response: Correct the syntax of the SQL statement.

Explanation: Upon return from a specific function name or a stored procedure name, DB2 has detected an overlay
storage beyond a parameter's declared length. The parameter number is specified for a stored procedure or function.
This is not permitted.
System action: Execution of the SQL statement is terminated.
Programmer response: Contact the author of the function or your database administrator. Until it is fixed, the
function should not be used.

-451 THE data-item DEFINITION IN THE CREATE OR ALTER STATEMENT FOR routine-name CONTAINS DATA TYPE type WHICH IS NOT SUPPORTED FOR THE TYPE AND LANGUAGE OF THE ROUTINE
Explanation: An error was made in the data-item part of the CREATE or ALTER statement for routine-name. The
statement contained an invalid data type, or it contained a distinct type which is based on the invalid data type.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the specification of the routine and reissue the CREATE statement.
SQLSTATE: 42815
-452 UNABLE TO ACCESS THE FILE REFERENCED BY HOST VARIABLE variable-position. REASON CODE: reason-code
Explanation: An error was encountered while DB2 was accessing, or attempting to access, the file referenced by the
specified host variable.
variable-position
Indicates the position of the host variable that referenced the file, as the nth host variable, where n is the
value.
reason-code
A numeric value that indicates the reason for the error:
1 If the file name length is invalid, the path has an invalid format, or a relative path was specified.
2 If the file option is invalid (the file option must be 2, 8, 16, or 32), or the specified file option is not
consistent with the operation that DB2 attempted to perform. For example, the file option
FILE_READ is specified on a FETCH SQL statement.
3 If the file cannot be found.
4 If the SQL_FILE_CREATE option was specified for a file with the same name as an existing file.
7 If a full disk was encountered while writing to the file.
9 If a media error was encountered while accessing the file.
12 If the HFS file DB2 attempted to open for a read, append, or rewrite operation is not a regular file:
v The BSAM data set that DB2 attempted to open for a read, append, or rewrite operation is not a
physical sequential (PS) or partition organization (PO) data set.
v The BSAM data set that DB2 attempted to open for a read, append, or rewrite operation does not
have a record format of VB, V, or U.
v The APPEND option was specified for a data set with partition organization (PO).
13 If errors were encountered when DB2 attempted to OPEN, READ, WRITE, or CLOSE an HFS file or
BSAM data set, there might be a system completion code on the console to indicate the reason that
DB2 was unable to perform the requested operation.
variable-position is set to 0 if the host variable position cannot be determined.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Take one of the following actions based on the reason-code value:
1 Correct the file name length, file name, and file path. If a relative path is being used for the HFS file, replace
it with an absolute path.
2 Correct the file option in the application.
3 Ensure that the file specified exists before attempting to access the file.
4 Delete the file if it is no longer required or specify a file name that does not currently exist.
7 Delete unnecessary files to free up disk space or specify a file that resides on another drive or file system
with sufficient disk space. Also, ensure that no operating system or user file size limits were reached. If your
application code page uses a multibyte encoding scheme, it is possible that only part of the last character
was written. Ensure that the file contains only fully formed characters.
8 The maximum length of the result column must be extended to allow for the expansion that occurs when
the string is converted.
9 Correct all errors on the media where the file has been read.
12 Take the appropriate action:
v Correct the file name to refer to a regular file if it is an HFS file.
v Correct the file name to refer to a PS or a PO data set if it is a BSAM data set.
v Correct the file operation to contain the correct action.
13 Correct the error based on the system completion code.
SQLSTATE: 428A1
-453 THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE RETURNS CLAUSE IN THE CREATE FUNCTION STATEMENT FOR function-name
Explanation: A problem casting the result of user-defined function function-name has been identified. The CAST
FROM data type is not castable to the RETURNS data type, and it must be. See the SQL Reference for details on
casting between data types.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the RETURNS or CAST FROM clause so that the CAST FROM data type is castable
to the RETURNS data type.
SQLSTATE: 42880
-454 THE SIGNATURE PROVIDED IN THE CREATE FUNCTION STATEMENT FOR function-name MATCHES THE SIGNATURE OF SOME OTHER FUNCTION ALREADY EXISTING IN THE SCHEMA
Explanation: The signature consists of the function name (function-name), the number of parameters defined for the
function, and an ordered list of the types of the parameters (without regard to any parameters of the types). In this
case there is a function already in the schema and the existing function has the same signature as the function being
created. See the SQL Reference for the details on the uniqueness of a function.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Determine if the existing function already provides the appropriate functionality. If not,
change the signature of the new function. One way to do that is to change the function name.
SQLSTATE: 42723
-455 IN CREATE FUNCTION FOR function-name, THE SCHEMA NAME schema-name1 PROVIDED FOR THE SPECIFIC NAME DOES NOT MATCH THE SCHEMA NAME schema-name2 OF THE FUNCTION
Explanation: If the SPECIFIC name is specified as a two part name, the schema-name1 portion must be the same as
the schema-name2 portion of the function-name. Note that the schema-name2 portion of function-name may have been
specified directly or it may have defaulted to the authorization ID of the statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the statement.
SQLSTATE: 42882
-456 IN CREATE FUNCTION FOR function-name, THE SPECIFIC NAME specific-name ALREADY EXISTS IN THE SCHEMA
Explanation: A SPECIFIC name has been explicitly specified as specific-name in the CREATE FUNCTION statement
for function-name, but this name already exists as the SPECIFIC name for another function within the schema.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Choose a new SPECIFIC name.
SQLSTATE: 42710
-457 A FUNCTION OR DISTINCT TYPE CANNOT BE CALLED name SINCE IT IS RESERVED FOR SYSTEM USE
Explanation: A user-defined function or distinct type cannot be created or referenced because the name is reserved
for use by the system.
name The name of the user-defined function or distinct type.
A number of names that are used as keywords are reserved for system use. These names cannot be used as
user-defined functions or distinct-type-names, even if they are delimited identifiers.
Those names are:
= < > >= <=
< > ?= ?> ?>
ALL AND ANY BETWEEN DISTINCT
EXCEPT EXISTS FALSE FOR FROM
IN IS LIKE MATCH NOT
NULL ONLY OR OVERLAPS SIMILAR
SOME TABLE TRUE TYPE UNIQUE
UNKNOWN
The names of built-in data types cannot be used as the name of a distinct type (for example, CHAR).
You cannot use an asterisk (*) as a specific name for a distinct type or procedure name.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Select a name for the function or distinct type that is not reserved for system use.
SQLSTATE: 42939
-458 IN A REFERENCE TO FUNCTION function-name BY SIGNATURE, A MATCHING FUNCTION COULD NOT BE FOUND
Explanation: In a reference to function function-name by signature, no matching function could be found. The
problem could be with the data type or some other attributes of a parameter. For some data types there are attributes
in addition to data type:
v Length, precision, or scale
While it is not necessary to specify a length, precision, or scale attribute for a data type, if one is specified then
there must be an exact match on the corresponding specification of the parameter for the existing function as
defined in SYSPARMS.
A type of FLOAT(n) does not need to match the defined value for n since 1<=n<=21 means REAL and 22<=n<=53
means DOUBLE. Matching occurs based on whether the type is REAL or DOUBLE.
However, a match on data type is sufficient.
To indicate this, an empty set of parentheses must be specified for the data types that allow a specification of
length, precision, or scale. For example, assuming a function exists for which a parameter was defined as
CHAR(12) on the CREATE FUNCTION statement, a reference to that function by a signature could specify this
parameter as either CHAR(12), or CHAR(). The CHAR() syntax provides a way to say, "do not care about length,
precision and scale attributes in finding a matching function".
FLOAT() cannot be used since the parameter value indicates different data types (REAL or DOUBLE).
If, however, neither length, precision, scale, or empty parenthesis were specified, then normal default rules apply.
For example, a specification of CHAR would result in CHAR(1) as on the CREATE TABLE statement. Furthermore,
this implicit specification of length, precision, or scale must exactly match the corresponding specification of the
parameter for the existing function as defined in SYSPARMS.
v Subtype, or encoding scheme
You do not need to specify the subtype or encoding scheme (CCSID clause) to identify an existing function in the
database. However, if a subtype or encoding scheme is specified then there must be an exact match on the
corresponding specification of the parameter for the existing function as defined in SYSPARMS.
Unqualified function names:
v For ALTER FUNCTION, DROP FUNCTION, COMMENT ON FUNCTION, GRANT and REVOKE statements for
EXECUTE on functions, an unqualified function name is implicitly qualified with the default schema, and this is
the schema where the function with the problem can be found.
v In the SOURCE clause of a CREATE FUNCTION statement, the qualification comes from the SQL path. In this
case, the is no matching function in the entire path.
Attention: A function cannot be sourced on the COALESCE, NULLIF, RAISE_ERROR, RID, or VALUE built-in
functions. Additionally, there are restrictions on the way that you can source on the COUNT, COUNT_BIG, CHAR,
and STRIP built-in functions because of some of the keywords that they accept.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Possible responses include:
v Changing the SQL path to include the correct schema.
v Changing the attributes of the parameters.
v Using a SPECIFIC name to refer to the function instead of a signature.

-461 A VALUE WITH DATA TYPE source-data-type CANNOT BE CAST TO TYPE target-data-type
Explanation: The statement contains an implicit or explicit CAST, but the combination of the source and target data
types is not supported. DB2 attempted to cast a value of source-data-type to the data type target-data-type. This
combination is not supported.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the data type of either the source or target so that the cast is supported.
For built-in data type values, or a cast involving a user-defined distinct type value, see Casting between data types
(DB2 SQL).
If an explicit CAST was specified, correct the CAST specification to specify a supported combination of source and
target types.

-469 SQL CALL STATEMENT MUST SPECIFY AN OUTPUT HOST VARIABLE FOR PARAMETER number
Explanation: DB2 received an SQL CALL statement for a stored procedure. DB2 found the row in the
SYSIBM.SYSROUTINES catalog table associated with the requested procedure name. However, parameter number was
identified in the SYSIBM.SYSPARMS table as an OUT or INOUT parameter. A host variable must be supplied on the
SQL CALL statement for a parameter that is defined as OUT or INOUT.
number
The parameter number from the ORDINAL field in SYSIBM.SYSPARMS.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If the SQL CALL statement is coded incorrectly, modify the SQL application to provide an
output host variable on the SQL CALL statement.
If the SYSIBM.SYSPARMS table contains incorrect information, the DROP PROCEDURE and CREATE PROCEDURE
statements must be used to replace the catalog definition for the stored procedure.
SQLSTATE: 42886
-470 SQL CALL STATEMENT SPECIFIED A NULL VALUE FOR INPUT PARAMETER number, BUT THE STORED PROCEDURE DOES NOT SUPPORT NULL VALUES.
Explanation: DB2 received an SQL CALL statement for a stored procedure and found a null value in the incoming
parameter list. The stored procedure was defined in the SYSIBM.SYSROUTINES catalog table with
PARAMETER_STYLE of GENERAL, which specifies that the routine does not accept null values.
A call to a stored procedure with a LANGUAGE value of JAVA receives this SQLCODE if an input parameter in the
Java stored procedure has a Java base type that cannot be set to a null value.
number
The parameter number from the ORDINAL field in SYSIBM.SYSPARMS.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If the stored procedure should not accept null values, change the calling application to
provide a non-null value.
If the stored procedure should accept null values, use the ALTER PROCEDURE statement to change the
PARAMETER STYLE of the stored procedure to be DB2SQL or GENERAL WITH NULLS.
SQLSTATE: 39004
-471 INVOCATION OF FUNCTION OR PROCEDURE name FAILED DUE TO REASON rc
Explanation: A routine was invoked. The routine invocation was not accepted because of DB2 reason code rc.
name The name of the routine that was invoked.
rc The DB2 reason code describing the cause of the failure.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. A DSNX9xx message describing the error might be displayed on
the MVS system console.
Programmer response: Correct the condition described by the DB2 reason code.
SQLSTATE: 55023
-472 CURSOR cursor-name WAS LEFT OPEN BY EXTERNAL FUNCTION function-name (SPECIFIC NAME specific-name)
Explanation: The function program did not close the specified cursor. Modify the function program so that it closes
the cursor.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Reissue the statement.
SQLSTATE: 24517
-473 A USER DEFINED DATA TYPE CANNOT BE CALLED THE SAME NAME AS A SYSTEM PREDEFINED TYPE (BUILT-IN TYPE)
Explanation: The name of a data type to be created has an unqualified name that is the same as a
system-predefined data type. The name that you specified is not allowed. Adding delimiters does not make the name
valid. The following names are restricted:
BIGINT DECIMAL REF
BINARY DECFLOAT ROWID
BLOB DOUBLE SMALLINT
BOOLEAN DOUBLE PRECISION TIME
CHAR FLOAT TIMESTAMP
CHAR VARYING GRAPHIC VARBINARY
CHARACTER INT VARCHAR
CHARACTER VARYING INTEGER VARGRAPHIC
CLOB LONG VARCHAR XML
DATALINK LONG VARGRAPHIC
DATE NUMERIC
DBCLOB REAL
DEC ROWID
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the statement to use another identifier for the name of the new user-defined type.
SQLSTATE: 42918
-475 THE RESULT TYPE type-1 OF THE SOURCE FUNCTION CANNOT BE CAST TO THE RETURNS TYPE type-2 OF THE USER-DEFINED FUNCTION function-name
Explanation: In order for the CREATE FUNCTION for a sourced user-defined function to be valid, the result type
(type-1) of the source function must be castable to the RETURNS type (type-2) of the function being created. There is
no supported cast between these data types.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the RETURNS data type or the SOURCE function identified so that the result type
of the SOURCE function is castable to the RETURNS data type.

-476 REFERENCE TO FUNCTION function-name WAS NAMED WITHOUT A SIGNATURE, BUT THE FUNCTION IS NOT UNIQUE WITHIN ITS SCHEMA
Explanation: References to a function without a signature are permitted, but the named function function-name must
be unique in its schema and it is not.
Note also that in the ALTER FUNCTION, DROP FUNCTION, COMMENT ON FUNCTION, GRANT and REVOKE
statements for EXECUTE on functions, an unqualified reference is qualified with the default schema, and this is the
schema where the problem can be found. In the SOURCE clause of a CREATE FUNCTION statement, the
qualification comes from the SQL path. In this case, the first schema in the path containing a function with this name
had other functions by the same name.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the reference by taking one of the following actions:
v Complete the signature.
v Use the SPECIFIC name of the function.
v Change the SQL path.

-478 DROP OR REVOKE ON OBJECT TYPE object-type CANNOT BE PROCESSED BECAUSE OBJECT dependent-object OF TYPE dependent-type IS DEPENDENT ON IT
Explanation: A DROP or REVOKE statement was issued on an object type that is a dependency for one or more
objects. An object type cannot be dropped or revoked if another object type has a dependency on that object type.
object-type
The type of object that is required and cannot be dropped.
dependent-object
The name of the object that prevents the object-type from being dropped or revoked.
dependent-type
The type of the object that prevents the object-type from being dropped or revoked.
Examples of where the dependency might occur include the following situations:
DROP statement
For a DROP statement, the following dependencies might exist based on the object-type value.
v If object-type is ALIAS:
¨C A row permission or a column mask references this alias.
v If object-type is DISTINCT TYPE:
¨C A column of a table is defined as this distinct type.
¨C A parameter or an SQL variable of a function is defined as this distinct type.
¨C A parameter or an SQL variable of a procedure is defined as this distinct type.
¨C A sequence is defined with this distinct type as the data type.
The dependency might be on one of the generated cast functions for a distinct type.
v If object-type is FUNCTION:
¨C A row permission or a column mask references this function.
¨C Another function is sourced on this function.
¨C A view uses this function.
¨C A trigger package uses this function.
¨C A table uses this function in a check constraint or user-defined default.
¨C A materialized query table definition uses this function.
v If object-type is JAR:
¨C A function or stored procedure uses this JAR in its EXTERNAL NAME.
¨C Another JAR uses this JAR in its Java path.
v If object-type is ROLE:
¨C A trusted context uses this role.
¨C The role is associated with the current thread.
¨C The role is the owner of the object that is being dropped.
¨C The role is the grantor of ACCESSCTRL, DATAACCESS, or system DBADM authority.
¨C The role is the grantor of any privilege or authority that used ACCESSCTRL or SECADM authority to
make the grant.
In the case where object-type is ROLE, this error can also occur when revoking the privileges held by this
role. When the role privileges are revoked, the cascading of the REVOKE statement might encounter
dependencies that prevent the REVOKE statement from being successfully processed.
v If object-type is SEQUENCE:
¨C An SQL function is defined that references this sequence.
¨C An SQL procedure is defined that references this sequence.
¨C A view definition is defined that references this sequence.
¨C A trigger is defined that references this sequence.
v If object-type is SYNONYM:
¨C A row permission or a column mask references this synonym.
v If object-type is TABLE:
¨C A row permission or a column mask references this table.
¨C This table is the history table for a system-period temporal table. An attempt to drop the table space or
database that contains the history table also causes this error.
v If object-type is VIEW:
¨C A row permission or a column mask references this view.
REVOKE statement
For a REVOKE statement, the following dependencies might exist based on the object-type value.
v SYSADM is being revoked. When SYSADM is revoked, the cascading of the REVOKE statement might
encounter dependencies that prevent the REVOKE statement from being successfully processed.
v If object-type is DISTINCT TYPE:
¨C A column of a table that is owned by the revokee is defined as this distinct type.
¨C A parameter or an SQL variable of a function that is owned by the revokee is defined as this distinct
type.
¨C A parameter or an SQL variable of a procedure that is owned by the revokee is defined as this distinct
type.
¨C A sequence that is owned by the revokee is defined with this distinct type as the data type.
v If object-type is FUNCTION:
¨C A function that is owned by the revokee is sourced on this function.
¨C A view that is owned by the revokee uses this function.
¨C A trigger package that is owned by the revokee uses this function.
¨C A table that is owned by the revokee uses this function in a check constraint or user-defined default.
¨C A materialized query table that is owned by the revokee uses this function in the definition.
¨C An index that is owned by the revokee uses this function.
v If object-type is JAR:
¨C A function or stored procedure that is owned by the revokee uses this JAR in its EXTERNAL NAME.
¨C Another JAR that is owned by the revokee uses this JAR in its Java path.
v If object-type is PROCEDURE:
¨C A trigger definition that is owned by the revokee, contains a CALL statement with the name of this
stored procedure.
v If object-type is SEQUENCE:
¨C An SQL function is defined that references this sequence.
¨C An SQL procedure is defined that references this sequence.
¨C A view definition is defined that references this sequence.
¨C A trigger is defined that references this sequence.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Remove the dependencies on this object. For example, drop the object that is identified by
dependent-object. Then, reissue the request.
SQLSTATE: The SQLSTATE depends on the values of object-type and dependent-type:

-480 THE PROCEDURE procedure-name HAS NOT YET BEEN CALLED
Explanation: The procedure identified in a DESCRIBE PROCEDURE or an ASSOCIATE LOCATORS statement has
not yet been called within the application process or the procedure has been called, but an explicit or implicit commit
occurred before the statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the statements so that the exact syntax used to specify the procedure name on the
CALL statement be the same as that on the ASSOCIATE LOCATOR and/or DESCRIBE PROCEDURE. If an
unqualified name is used to CALL the procedure, the 1-part name must also be used on the other statements. If the
CALL statement is made with a 3-part name, and the current server is the same as the location in the 3-part name,
the ASSOCIATE LOCATOR or DESCRIBE procedure can omit the location. Rerun the statements.
SQLSTATE: 51030
-482 THE PROCEDURE procedure-name RETURNED NO LOCATORS
Explanation: The procedure identified in an ASSOCIATE LOCATORS statement returned no result set locators.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Determine if result set locators are returned from the identified procedure by using the
DESCRIBE PROCEDURE statement.
SQLSTATE: 51030
-483 IN CREATE FUNCTION FOR function-name STATEMENT, THE NUMBER OF PARAMETERS DOES NOT MATCH THE NUMBER OF PARAMETERS OF THE SOURCE FUNCTION
Explanation: An attempt is being made to CREATE a user-defined function function-name which is sourced on
another function. One of the following situations has been identified:
v The SOURCE clause uses a function-name (input parameter list) to identify the source function, and the number of
types in the list is different from the number of parameters of the function being created.
v The SOURCE clause uses different syntax to identify the source function, and the number of types of that function
is different from the number of parameters of the function being created.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: The number of parameters for the SOURCE function and for the function being created must
be the same. The identification of the SOURCE function needs to be changed to:
v fix the input parameter list
v correct the function name or function specific name to identify the proper function.
It is also possible that the SQL path needs to be corrected in order for correct function resolution to occur.
SQLSTATE: 42885
-487 object-type object-name ATTEMPTED TO EXECUTE AN SQL STATEMENT WHEN THE DEFINITION OF THE FUNCTION OR PROCEDURE DID NOT SPECIFY THIS ACTION
Explanation: A user-defined function or stored procedure object-name was invoked and attempted to execute SQL
statements, but the function or procedure was created with the NO SQL option.
In an environment of nested functions and procedures, the SQL option in effect is the most restrictive one that has
been specified in the nested hierarchy of functions an procedures. The SQL data access option in effect does not allow
for modifying data.
System action: The SQL statement cannot be executed.
Programmer response: Either use an ALTER statement to change the definition of the function or procedure to
allow SQL statements, or remove the failing SQL statement from the external function or procedure.
SQLSTATE: 38001
-490 NUMBER number DIRECTLY SPECIFIED IN AN SQL STATEMENT IS OUTSIDE THE RANGE OF ALLOWABLE VALUES IN THIS CONTEXT (minval, maxval)
Explanation: A number (number) was specified that is not valid in the context in which it was specified. The
minimum allowed value in this context is minval. The maximum allowed value in this context is maxval. n must be
within the range specified by minval and maxval (minval =< n =< maxval).
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the value n to a valid value in the statement.
SQLSTATE: 428B7
-491 CREATE STATEMENT FOR USER-DEFINED FUNCTION function-name MUST HAVE A RETURNS CLAUSE AND: THE EXTERNAL CLAUSE WITH OTHER REQUIRED KEYWORDS; THE PARAMETER NAMES; OR THE SOURCE CLAUSE
Explanation: A required clause is missing in the CREATE for the specified function.
function-name
The name of the function.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Add the missing clauses, and reissue the failing statement.
For an EXTERNAL function, specify EXTERNAL and one of the following options:
v LANGUAGE
v PARAMETER STYLE
For a user-defined SOURCE FUNCTION, specify the SOURCE clause.
SQLSTATE: 42601
-492 THE CREATE FUNCTION FOR function-name HAS A PROBLEM WITH PARAMETER NUMBER number. IT MAY INVOLVE A MISMATCH WITH A SOURCE FUNCTION
Explanation: The parameter in position number of function function-name is in error.
function-name
The name of the function that cannot be created.
number The position number of the function parameter that has the problem.
This error is issued in the following circumstances:
v The parameter of the source function is not castable to the corresponding parameter of the function being created.
If the parameter of the function being created is a table parameter, the corresponding parameter of the source
function must also be a table parameter. Furthermore, the column numbers for both of the table parameters must
be the same.
If the parameter of the function being created is not a table parameter, the corresponding parameter of the source
function must also not be a table parameter.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Possible corrections include:
v Identify a different source function.
v Change the data type of the parameter of the function being created so that the data type of the source function
can be cast to this data type.

-495 ESTIMATED PROCESSOR COST OF estimate-amount1 PROCESSOR SECONDS (estimate-amount2 SERVICE UNITS) IN COST CATEGORY cost-category EXCEEDS A RESOURCE LIMIT ERROR THRESHOLD OF limit- amount SERVICE UNITS
Explanation: The prepare of a dynamic INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, DELETE, or SELECT SQL statement resulted in
a cost estimate that exceeded the error threshold value specified in the resource limit specification table (RLST). This
error is also issued if DB2's cost category value was ¡°B¡±, and the default action specified in the RLF_CATEGORY_B
column in the RLST is to issue an error.
estimate_amount1
The cost estimate (in processor seconds) if the prepared INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, DELETE or SELECT
statement were to be executed.
estimate_amount2
The cost estimate (in service units) if the prepared INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, DELETE or SELECT
statement were to be executed.
cost-category
DB2's cost-category for this SQL statement. The possible values are A or B.
limit-amount
The error threshold (in service units) specified in the RLFASUERR column of the RLST. If you entered any
negative number for the RLFASUERR column, the value for limit-amount defaults to zero.
System action: The prepare of the dynamic INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, DELETE, or SELECT statement was
unsuccessful.
User response: If the warning is caused by an SQL statement that is consuming too much processor resource,
attempt to rewrite the statement to perform more efficiently. Another option is to ask the administrator to increase
the error threshold value in the RLST.
Programmer response: If this SQLCODE was returned because the cost category value is ¡°B¡±, it might be that the
statement is using parameter markers or that some statistics are not available for the referenced tables and columns.
Make sure the administrator has run the utility RUNSTATS on the referenced tables. It might also be that UDFs will
be invoked when the statement is executed, or for INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, or DELETE statements that triggers
are defined on the changed table. Check the DSN_STATEMNT_TABLE or the IFCID 22 record for this statement to
find the reasons this SQL statement has been put in cost category ¡°B¡±. If the program cannot be changed, or if
statistics cannot be obtained, ask the administrator to change the value in the RLF_CATEGORY_B column in the
RLST to ¡°Y¡± which allows the statement to execute or ¡°W¡± which returns a warning instead of an error.
SQLSTATE: 57051
-496 THE SQL STATEMENT CANNOT BE EXECUTED BECAUSE IT REFERENCES A RESULT SET THAT WAS NOT CREATED BY THE CURRENT SERVER
Explanation: The SQL statement cannot be executed because the current server is different from the server that
called a stored procedure. The SQL statement can be any of the following:
v ALLOCATE CURSOR
v DESCRIBE CURSOR
v FETCH (using an allocated cursor)
v CLOSE (using an allocated cursor)
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Connect to the server that called the stored procedure which created the result set before
running the SQL statement that failed.
SQLSTATE: 51033
-497 THE MAXIMUM LIMIT OF INTERNAL IDENTIFIERS HAS BEEN EXCEEDED FOR DATABASE database-name
Explanation: The SQL statement cannot be executed because an internal identifier limit has been exceeded for the
database. The cause of this error is due to one of the following:
1. On a CREATE DATABASE statement, the limit of 65217 DBIDs has been exceeded.
2. For all other statements, the limit of 32767 OBIDs has been exceeded for that database.
3. If the database is a WORKFILE database, then one of the following reasons might apply:
v The number of tablespaces in the WORKFILE database has exceeded the limit of 500.
v The number of indexes defined on declared global temporary tables belonging to all agents on the local DB2
member has exceeded the limit of 10,000.
v The number of tables and triggers belonging to a local agent exceeded the limit of 11,767. The tables in the
WORKFILE database include work files, created global temporary tables, and declared global temporary tables.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Take the appropriate action as described in the following cases:
1. In the case of a DBID limit being exceeded, DROP all unused databases and issue a COMMIT.
2. In the case of an OBID limit being exceeded, take one of the following actions:
v DROP all unused objects in the database and issue a COMMIT. After the COMMIT, run the REORG utility for
the table space in question.
v Specify a different database.
v Run the MODIFY utility to reclaim unused OBIDs. See Reclaiming space in the DBD (DB2 Utilities) for
additional information.

-499 CURSOR cursor-name HAS ALREADY BEEN ASSIGNED TO THIS OR ANOTHER RESULT SET FROM PROCEDURE procedure-name.
Explanation: An attempt was made to assign a cursor to a result set using the SQL statement ALLOCATE CURSOR
and one of the following applies:
v The result set locator variable specified in the ALLOCATE CURSOR statement has been previously assigned to
cursor cursor-name.
v Cursor cursor-name specified in the ALLOCATE CURSOR statement has been previously assigned to a result set
from stored procedure procedure-name.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Determine if the target result set named in the ALLOCATE CURSOR statement has been
previously assigned to a cursor.
If the result set has been previously assigned to cursor cursor-name, then either choose another target result set or call
stored procedure procedure-name again and reissue the ASSOCIATE LOCATOR and ALLOCATE CURSOR statements.
If the result set has not been previously assigned to a cursor, the cursor cursor-name specified in the ALLOCATE
CURSOR statement has been previously assigned to some result set from stored procedure procedure-name. You can
not assign cursor cursor-name to another result set, so you must specify a different cursor name in the ALLOCATE
CURSOR statement.
Correct the statements so that the exact syntax used to specify the procedure name on the CALL statement be the
same as that on the ASSOCIATE LOCATOR and/or DESCRIBE PROCEDURE. If an unqualified name is used to
CALL the procedure, the 1-part name must also be used on the other statements. If the CALL statement is made with
a 3-part name, and the current server is the same as the location in the 3-part name, the ASSOCIATE LOCATOR or
DESCRIBE procedure can omit the location.
SQLSTATE: 24516
-500 THE IDENTIFIED CURSOR WAS CLOSED WHEN THE CONNECTION WAS DESTROYED
Explanation: The FETCH, UPDATE, DELETE, or CLOSE statement identifies a closed cursor that was defined with
the WITH HOLD option. The cursor was closed when the connection on which it was dependent was destroyed
during a commit operation. The connection was destroyed because the application process placed it in the released
state, or the application plan was bound with the DISCONNECT(AUTOMATIC) option.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Take one of the following actions:
v If you want the cursor closed, change the application program so that the cursor is not referenced in the closed
state.
v If you want the cursor open and the connection was placed in the released state by the application program,
change the program so that the connection is not placed in the released state until the cursor is explicitly closed.
v If you want the cursor open and the connection was placed in the released state as a result of the
DISCONNECT(AUTOMATIC) option, rebind the plan using DISCONNECT(CONDITIONAL).
Correct the error in the application, rebind the plan, and resubmit the job.
SQLSTATE: 24501
-501 THE CURSOR IDENTIFIED IN A FETCH OR CLOSE STATEMENT IS NOT OPEN
Explanation: The application program attempted either to fetch using a cursor or to close a cursor at a time when
the specified cursor was not open.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Check for a previous SQL return code that might have closed the cursor.
v Commit and rollback operations close cursors.
v SQL return codes -404, -652, -679, -802, -901, -904, -909, -910, -911, -913, and -952 might force the cursor to close.
v An error SQLCODE during predicate processing closes the cursor.
After the cursor is closed, any fetches or close cursor statements will receive SQLCODE -501.
If no previous SQL return codes have been issued, correct the logic of the application program to ensure that the
cursor is open at the time the FETCH or CLOSE statement is processed.
SQLSTATE: 24501

CLOSE (DB2 SQL)
FETCH (DB2 SQL)
-502 THE CURSOR IDENTIFIED IN AN OPEN STATEMENT IS ALREADY OPEN
Explanation: The application program attempted to execute an OPEN statement for a cursor that was already open.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The cursor was unchanged (that is, it was not 'reopened').
Programmer response: Correct the logic of the application program to ensure that it does not attempt to execute an
OPEN statement for a cursor that is already open.
SQLSTATE: 24502
-503 A COLUMN CANNOT BE UPDATED BECAUSE IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE UPDATE CLAUSE OF THE SELECT STATEMENT OF THE CURSOR
Explanation: The application program attempted to update (using a cursor) a value in a column of the object table
that was not identified in the FOR UPDATE clause in the cursor declaration.
Any column that is to be updated must be identified in the FOR UPDATE clause of the cursor declaration.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No data was updated in the object table.
Programmer response: Correct the application program. If the column is to be updated, its name must be added to
the FOR UPDATE clause of the cursor declaration.
SQLSTATE: 42912
-504 CURSOR NAME cursor-name IS NOT DECLARED
Explanation: Cursor cursor-name was referenced in an SQL statement, and one of the following is true:
v Cursor cursor-name was not declared (using the DECLARE CURSOR statement) or allocated (using the ALLOCATE
CURSOR statement) in the application program or SQL routine before it was referenced.
v Cursor cursor-name was referenced in a positioned UPDATE or DELETE statement which is not a supported
operation for an allocated cursor.
v Cursor cursor-name was allocated, but a CLOSE cursor statement naming cursor-name was issued and deallocated
the cursor before this cursor reference.
v Cursor cursor-name was allocated, but a ROLLBACK operation occurred and deallocated the cursor before this
cursor reference.
v Cursor cursor-name was allocated, but its associated cursor declared in a stored procedure was not declared WITH
HOLD, and a COMMIT operation occurred and deallocated the cursor before this cursor reference. The COMMIT
operation can be either explicit (the COMMIT statement) or implicit (that is, a stored procedure defined as
COMMIT_ON_RETURN = 'Y' was called before this cursor reference).
v Cursor cursor-name was allocated, but its associated stored procedure was called again since the cursor was
allocated, new result sets were returned, and cursor cursor-name was deallocated.
v The declaration of a cursor cursor-name was not in scope for the reference to a cursor named cursor-name.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Check the application program or SQL routine for completeness and for a possible spelling
error in the cursor declaration or allocation. The declaration for or allocation of a cursor must appear in an
application program or SQL routine before SQL statements that reference the cursor.
If the cursor-name was <UNKNOWN>, the cursor was not successfully declared or allocated. This error can occur if
SQL(DB2) was used, and a warning message was issued during precompilation. Check the precompile output for
warning messages on the DECLARE CURSOR or ALLOCATE CURSOR statement, and correct the statement.
For an allocated cursor, if an implicit or explicit COMMIT, ROLLBACK, or CLOSE occurred since the cursor was
successfully allocated, modify the application program logic to do one of the following actions:
v After the COMMIT, ROLLBACK, or CLOSE operation, call the associated stored procedure again, and reissue the
ASSOCIATE LOCATORS and ALLOCATE CURSOR statements.
v For COMMIT, declare the associated cursor in the stored procedure WITH HOLD so the COMMIT operation does
not deallocate the cursor.
For an allocated cursor, if the associated stored procedure was called again and new result sets were returned since
the cursor was allocated, reissue the ASSOCIATE LOCATORS and ALLOCATE CURSOR statements.
SQLSTATE: 34000
-507 THE CURSOR IDENTIFIED IN THE UPDATE OR DELETE STATEMENT IS NOT OPEN
Explanation: The application program attempted to execute an UPDATE or DELETE WHERE CURRENT OF cursor
statement at a time when the specified cursor was not open.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No update or delete was performed.
Programmer response: Check for a previous SQL return code that might have closed the cursor. SQLCODES -404, -652, -679,-802, -901, -904, -909, -910, -911, -913, and -952 may force the cursor to close. After the cursor is closed, any fetches or close cursor statements receive SQLCODE -501. Any updates or deletes receive this SQLCODE -507.  Correct the logic of the application program to ensure that the specified cursor is open at the time the UPDATE or DELETE statement is executed.
SQLSTATE: 24501
-508 THE CURSOR IDENTIFIED IN THE UPDATE OR DELETE STATEMENT IS NOT POSITIONED ON A ROW OR ROWSET THAT CAN BE UPDATED OR DELETED
Explanation: The application program attempted to execute an UPDATE or DELETE WHERE CURRENT OF cursor
statement at a time when the specified cursor was not positioned on a row or rowset of the object table. The cursor
must be positioned on the row that is to be updated or deleted.
This can occur in the following situations:
v The cursor is no longer positioned on the row because another cursor in the same application program deletes the
row or updates an index column. This includes deletes and index column updates that are performed as a result of
rolling back to a savepoint.
v A sensitive dynamic cursor with the FOR ROW n OF ROWSET clause is specified, and the specified row of the
current rowset has been updated or deleted.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No data was updated or deleted, and the cursor position is
unchanged.
Programmer response: Correct the logic of the application program to ensure that the cursor is correctly positioned
on the intended row of the object table before the UPDATE or DELETE statement is executed. Note that for single
row or non-rowset cursors, the cursors are not positioned on a row if FETCH returned SQLCODE +100.

-509 THE TABLE IDENTIFIED IN THE UPDATE OR DELETE STATEMENT IS NOT THE SAME TABLE DESIGNATED BY THE CURSOR
Explanation: The application program attempted to execute an UPDATE or DELETE WHERE CURRENT OF cursor
statement where the table named in that statement did not match the name of the table specified in the declaration
for that cursor.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The update or delete was not performed.
Programmer response: Correct the application program to ensure that the table identified in the UPDATE or
DELETE statement is the same table identified in the declaration for the cursor.
SQLSTATE: 42827
-510 THE TABLE DESIGNATED BY THE CURSOR OF THE UPDATE OR DELETE STATEMENT CANNOT BE MODIFIED
Explanation: The application program attempted to execute an UPDATE or DELETE WHERE CURRENT OF cursor
statement against a table or view that cannot be updated or deleted. This error can be returned for the following
reasons:
v A delete was performed from a read-only view or for an update in which the cursor was not defined with the FOR
UPDATE clause.
v A target table exists at a remote location and DB2 has employed block fetching because you explicitly declared the
cursor FOR FETCH ONLY, or because the application is bound CURRENTDATA( NO) and the cursor is
ambiguous.
v DB2 has employed parallelism to execute the SELECT statement associated with the cursor named in a DELETE
WHERE CURRENT OF cursor statement, or a DELETE WHERE CURRENT OF is issued against a row which DB2
cannot guarantee to have not been modified by another application since the time the cursor was positioned upon
it (in accordance with ISO(CS)) semantics for an ambiguous cursor in an application bound CURRENTDATA(NO)).
v The cursor references a view on which an INSTEAD OF UPDATE trigger is defined, even if the view is an
updatable view.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No data was updated or deleted in the object table or view.
Programmer response: The requested UPDATE or DELETE cannot be performed.
For a remote table, modify the DECLARE CURSOR and then rebind the PLAN.
For a cursor that uses parallelism, disable parallelism for the query by using the DEGREE(1) BIND option for static
SQL or by setting the CURRENT DEGREE special register to '1' for dynamic SQL.
For an ambiguous cursor in an application bound CURRENTDATA(NO), either make the cursor unambiguous
(declare it FOR UPDATE OF), or rebind the application CURRENTDATA(YES).
For a view with INSTEAD OF triggers, drop those triggers.

-511 THE FOR UPDATE CLAUSE CANNOT BE SPECIFIED BECAUSE THE RESULT TABLE DESIGNATED BY THE SELECT STATEMENT CANNOT BE MODIFIED
Explanation: The result table of the SELECT statement cannot be updated. This error can occur if the SELECT
specifies more than one table or view in the FROM clause, if the SELECT list contains a built-in function or
DISTINCT, or if the statement contains an ORDER BY or GROUP BY or HAVING clause. This error can also occur if
a view is specified in the FROM clause and the view cannot be updated, or if a data change statement is specified
within the SELECT statement, for example: SELECT from INSERT.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Updates cannot be performed on the result table as it is specified.

-512 STATEMENT REFERENCE TO REMOTE OBJECT IS INVALID
Explanation: One of the following conditions exists:
v The statement refers to multiple locations.
v A statement with a remote reference is being EXPLAINED either by a dynamic EXPLAIN statement or the
EXPLAIN(YES) option.
v An alias is used incorrectly.
v A three-part name is implicitly or explicitly used in a statement that is not supported by the DB2 private protocols.
v A three-part name is implicitly or explicitly used in a triggered statement.
v A PREPARE statement contains an ATTRIBUTES clause. This is not supported by the DB2 private protocols.
v A three-part name with a remote reference is not allowed in a body of an SQL function.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If the object cannot be meaningfully eliminated from the statement, see your database
administrator for other ways to obtain the data required.
If the remote object reference is in a triggered SQL statement, you can instead invoke a user-defined function or a
stored procedure from the trigger and access the remote object from the function or stored procedure.
SQLSTATE: 56023
-513 THE ALIAS alias-name MUST NOT BE DEFINED ON ANOTHER LOCAL OR REMOTE ALIAS
Explanation: The object indicated by alias-name is a local or remote alias. An alias is not allowed to be defined on a
local alias, and it should not be defined on a remote alias.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Modify the SQL statement to ensure that all object references are to base tables or views.
SQLSTATE: 42924
-514 THE CURSOR cursor-name IS NOT IN A PREPARED STATE
Explanation: The application program has tried to use a cursor, 'cursor-name,' that is not in a prepared state. The
cursor is associated with a statement that:
1. Was never prepared.
2. Was invalidated by a commit or rollback operations
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: For case 1, ensure that you prepare the statement that is named in the DECLARE CURSOR
statement for 'cursor-name' before you try to open the cursor.
For case 2, take one of the following actions:
v Use the WITH HOLD option of DECLARE CURSOR.
v Do not execute a commit or rollback operation until you are finished using the cursor.
v Prepare the statement again after the commit or rollback.

-516 THE DESCRIBE STATEMENT DOES NOT SPECIFY A PREPARED STATEMENT
Explanation: An attempt was made to execute a DESCRIBE statement that did not refer to a statement that had
been successfully prepared at the current server.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Verify that the statement name specified in the DESCRIBE statement is a statement that has
been prepared at the current server.
SQLSTATE: 26501
-517 CURSOR cursor-name CANNOT BE USED BECAUSE ITS STATEMENT NAME DOES NOT IDENTIFY A PREPARED SELECT STATEMENT
Explanation: The cursor 'cursor-name' could not be used as specified because the prepared statement named in the
declaration for the cursor was not a SELECT statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Verify that the statement-name is specified correctly in the PREPARE statement and the
DECLARE CURSOR statement for cursor 'cursor-name'. Alternatively, correct the application program logic to ensure
that only prepared SELECT statements are used in association with cursor declarations.
SQLSTATE: 07005
-518 THE EXECUTE STATEMENT DOES NOT IDENTIFY A VALID PREPARED STATEMENT
Explanation: One of the following conditions exists:
v The statement identified in the EXECUTE statement has not been prepared.
v The statement identified in the EXECUTE statement identifies a SELECT, or ASSOCIATE LOCATORS statement
v The statement identified in the EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement identifies a SELECT or ASSOCIATE LOCATORS
statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Ensure that you prepare the statement prior to EXECUTE. Also, ensure that the statement
prepared statement is not:
v A SELECT statement.
v An ASSOCIATE LOCATORS statement.

-519 THE PREPARE STATEMENT IDENTIFIES THE SELECT STATEMENT OF THE OPENED CURSOR cursor-name
Explanation: The application program has attempted to PREPARE (actually, re-PREPARE) the SELECT statement for
the specified cursor at a time when that cursor was already open.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The cursor was not affected.
Programmer response: Correct the logic of the application program so that it does not attempt to re-PREPARE the
SELECT statement for a cursor when that cursor is open.
SQLSTATE: 24506
-525 THE SQL STATEMENT CANNOT BE EXECUTED BECAUSE IT WAS IN ERROR AT BIND TIME FOR SECTION = sectno PACKAGE = pkgname CONSISTENCY TOKEN = contoken
Explanation: One of the following:
v The statement was in error when the package was bound, but the error was ignored then because the option
SQLERROR (CONTINUE) was used. Since the statement contains an error, it cannot be executed.
v The statement might not be an executable statement at this location, or might only be executable by a DB2
application requester (for example, DECLARE TABLE in an application running on OS/2 causes this message).
The variables are:
sectno Section number
pkgname
locid.collid.pkgid
contoken
Consistency token in hexadecimal
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If the SQL statement is not supposed to execute at the indicated location, then correct the
program so that the statement in error does not execute at that location. Precompile, compile, and bind replace the
package. If the SQL statement is supposed to execute at the indicated location, correct the problem found when it
was bound and bind the package over using BIND with ACTION(REPLACE). If multiple versions of the package
have been bound, issue the following SELECT statement to determine which version has the error: SELECT
VERSION FROM locid.SYSIBM.SYSPACKAGE WHERE LOCATION = ' ' AND COLLID = 'collid' AND NAME =
'pkgid' AND HEX(CONTOKEN) = 'contoken'
Where:
locid Location name
collid Collection id
pkgid Program name
SQLSTATE: 51015
-526 THE REQUESTED OPERATION OR USAGE DOES NOT APPLY TO table-type TEMPORARY TABLE table-name
Explanation: DB2 assumes that the SQL statement being executed refers to a created or declared temporary table
named table-name, and the requested operation or usage in the statement is not allowed on the temporary table.
table-type
CREATED or DECLARED
CREATED is for a temporary table defined by the CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE statement.
DECLARED is for a temporary table defined by the DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE statement.
table-name
Qualified name of the temporary table.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Modify the SQL statement to ensure that the object references are not to the indicated type
of temporary table, or if table-type is DECLARED and you intended table-name to refer to an existing persistent base
table, you must perform one of the following actions:
v Recreate the persistent base table table-name with a different schema qualifier
v In the same application process, issue a DROP TABLE for table name followed by a COMMIT to drop the declared
temporary table and afterwards be able to reference the persistent base table with the same table-name in the same
application process
v Remove the DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE statement from the application process to use the persistent
base table with the same table-name
SQLSTATE: 42995
-530 THE INSERT OR UPDATE VALUE OF FOREIGN KEY constraint-name IS INVALID
Explanation: An insert or update operation attempted to place a value in a foreign key of the object table; however,
this value was not equal to some value of the parent key of the parent table.
When a row is inserted into a dependent table, the insert value of a foreign key must be equal to the value of the
parent key of some row of the parent table in the associated relationship.
When the value of the foreign key is updated, the update value of a foreign key must be equal to the value of the
parent key of some row of the parent table of the associated relationship.
System action: The UPDATE, MERGE, or INSERT statement cannot be executed. The object table is unchanged.
Programmer response: Examine the insert or update value of the foreign key first, and then compare it with each of
the parent key values of the parent table to determine the cause of the problem.
SQLSTATE: 23503
-531 PARENT KEY IN A PARENT ROW CANNOT BE UPDATED BECAUSE IT HAS ONE OR MORE DEPENDENT ROWS IN RELATIONSHIP constraint-name
Explanation: For plans and packages bound beginning with Version 5 or dynamic SQL, a multi-row update of a
parent key attempted to remove a parent key value on which a foreign key was dependent.
For plans and packages bound prior to Version 5, an UPDATE operation attempted to update a primary key in the
specified row of the object table; however, the primary key in the specified row had dependent rows associated with
it. The value of a primary key in a parent row cannot be updated if the parent row has any dependent rows.
System action: The UPDATE statement cannot be executed. The object table is unchanged.
Programmer response: Examine the parent key of the object table and the foreign key of the dependent table to
determine if the value of the specified row of the parent key should be changed. If this does not expose the problem,
examine the contents of the object table and the dependent table to determine the cause of the problem.

-532 THE RELATIONSHIP constraint-name RESTRICTS THE DELETION OF ROW WITH RID X rid-number
Explanation: A DELETE operation attempted to delete a specified parent row in the object table and all related
descendent rows in the descendent tables. However, a delete rule of RESTRICT or NO ACTION was specified for one
or more descendent tables.
A row of the table cannot be deleted because it has a dependent in a relationship with a delete rule of RESTRICT or
NO ACTION or the deletion cascades to a row which is a dependent in a relationship with a delete rule of
RESTRICT or NO ACTION.
If the statement that failed is an ALTER TABLE with ALTER PART ROTATE FIRST TO LAST, then there is a
referential constraint that is defined with DELETE RESTRICT on the table, and the data in the partition that is to be
reused cannot be deleted because of the referential constraint.
System action: The DELETE statement cannot be executed. The contents of the object table are unchanged.
Programmer response: Examine the delete rule for all descendent tables to determine the cause of the problem. The
specific tables involved can be determined from the relationship constraint-name. The specific descendent row is
known by RID X rid-number.
SQLSTATE: 23504
-533 INVALID MULTIPLE-ROW INSERT
Explanation: An INSERT operation with a subselect attempted to insert multiple rows into a self-referencing table.
The subselect of the INSERT operation should return no more than one row of data.
System action: The INSERT statement cannot be executed. The contents of the object table are unchanged.
Programmer response: Examine the search condition of the subselect to make sure that no more than one row of
data is selected.
SQLSTATE: 21501
-534 THE PRIMARY KEY CANNOT BE UPDATED BECAUSE OF MULTIPLE-ROW UPDATE
Explanation: An UPDATE operation attempted to update a primary key on multiple rows of the object table.
An UPDATE statement updating the primary key cannot be used to update more than one row of the object table.
Note: This SQLCODE will only be issued for plans and packages bound prior to Version 5. SQLCODE -534 will not
be issued for dynamic SQL or plans and packages bound with Version 5 or later releases.
System action: The UPDATE statement cannot be executed. The contents of the object table are unchanged.
Programmer response: Examine the search condition of the UPDATE statement to make sure that no more than one
row of the object table is selected to be updated.

-536 THE DELETE STATEMENT IS INVALID BECAUSE TABLE table-name CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE OPERATION
Explanation: A DELETE operation with the indicated table referenced in a subquery was attempted.
If 'T' is the object table of the DELETE, the indicated table is one of the following:
v A dependent of 'T' in a relationship with a delete rule of CASCADE or SET NULL
v A dependent of another table in a relationship with a delete rule of CASCADE or SET NULL in which deletions
from 'T' can cascade to that table.
System action: The DELETE statement cannot be processed. The contents of the object table are unchanged.
Programmer response: Do not attempt to reference a table in a subquery of a DELETE statement when the table can
be affected by the DELETE statement.
SQLSTATE: 42914

Explanation: PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, or PARTITIONING KEY can each be followed by a list of
column names. The statement violates the rule that no column name can appear more than once in any such list.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the statement to specify unique names for each column.
SQLSTATE: 42709
-538 FOREIGN KEY name DOES NOT CONFORM TO THE DESCRIPTION OF A PARENT KEY OF TABLE table-name
Explanation: The definition of the indicated foreign key does not conform to the description of parent key of the
indicated table due to one of the following reasons:
v The referenced parent key has not been defined as a primary key or a unique key.
v The keys do not have the same number of columns.
v The description of the keys are not identical. The requirement for identical descriptions includes data type, length
attribute, and field procedure.
name is the constraint-name specified in the foreign key clause or, if a constraint-name was not specified, the first
column-name specified in the clause.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the statement so that the description of the foreign key references a primary key or
unique key, or so that the description of the foreign key conforms to that of a parent key of the indicated table.
SQLSTATE: 42830
-539 TABLE table-name DOES NOT HAVE A PRIMARY KEY
Explanation: DB2 cannot perform the CREATE or ALTER TABLE statement because the indicated table does not
have a primary key. Thus, the primary key cannot be dropped, or the table cannot be defined as a parent in a
referential constraint.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the statement to reference a table with a primary key, or define a primary key with
ALTER TABLE ADD PRIMARY KEY before referencing the table in a FOREIGN KEY clause.
SQLSTATE: 42888
-540 THE DEFINITION OF TABLE table-name IS INCOMPLETE BECAUSE IT LACKS A PRIMARY INDEX OR A REQUIRED UNIQUE INDEX
Explanation: An attempt was made to use table table-name in a CREATE or ALTER statement to define a foreign key
or a clone table, or it was referenced in an SQL manipulative statement. However, the current status of the table is
incomplete, so it cannot be used as specified. The definition of the table may be incomplete because the table was
defined with a PRIMARY KEY clause, a UNIQUE clause, or a ROWID column with the GENERATED BY DEFAULT
attribute. The definition of the table is incomplete, and it cannot be used until a unique index is defined for:
v the primary key (the primary index)
v a ROWID column
v for each set of columns in any UNIQUE clause (the required unique indexes).
An attempt was made to use the table in a FOREIGN KEY clause or in an SQL manipulative statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Define a primary index or a required unique index on the table before referencing it.
SQLSTATE: 57001
-542 column-name CANNOT BE A COLUMN OF A HASH KEY, PRIMARY KEY, A UNIQUE CONSTRAINT, OR A PARENT KEY BECAUSE IT CAN CONTAIN NULL VALUES
Explanation: A column that is identified in a HASH KEY, a PRIMARY KEY, a UNIQUE constraint clause, or a
parent key (through a REFERENCES clause) is defined to allow null values. Null values are not permitted for these
keys and clauses.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: In the case of a column identified in a HASH KEY, a PRIMARY KEY or a UNIQUE
constraint clause, correct the statement and resubmit it.
In the case of a column identified in a REFERENCES clause:
1. Drop the parent table.
2. Recreate it with referenced columns defined as NOT NULL.
3. Resubmit the statement.
SQLSTATE: 42831
-543 A ROW IN A PARENT TABLE CANNOT BE DELETED BECAUSE THE CHECK CONSTRAINT check-constraint RESTRICTS THE DELETION
Explanation: The delete operation cannot be executed because the target table is a parent table and is connected
with a referential constraint to a dependent table with a delete rule of SET NULL. However, a check constraint
defined on the dependent table restricts the column from containing a null value.
System action: The DELETE statement was not executed. The contents of the tables are unchanged.
Programmer response: Examine the foreign key and its delete rule in the dependent table and the conflicting check
constraint. Change either the delete rule or the check constraint so that they do not conflict.
SQLSTATE: 23511
-544 THE CHECK CONSTRAINT SPECIFIED IN THE ALTER TABLE STATEMENT CANNOT BE ADDED BECAUSE AN EXISTING ROW VIOLATES THE CHECK CONSTRAINT
Explanation: An existing row violates the check constraint specified in the ALTER TABLE statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The check constraint definition is not added to the table. The
table definition is unchanged.
Programmer response: Examine the check constraint definition that was specified in the ALTER TABLE statement
and the data in the table to determine why the ALTER TABLE statement was rejected.
You can determine which rows violated the check constraint by using the SELECT statement, negating the check
constraint in the WHERE clause. For example:
SELECT * FROM table WHERE (NOT (check-condition));
SQLSTATE: 23512
-545 THE REQUESTED OPERATION IS NOT ALLOWED BECAUSE A ROW DOES NOT SATISFY THE CHECK CONSTRAINT check-constraint
Explanation: Check constraint violations occurred on an INSERT, UPDATE, or MERGE statement. The resulting row
violated the check constraint definition on the table.
System action: The INSERT, UPDATE, or MERGE statement cannot be executed. The contents of the table are
unchanged.
Programmer response: Examine the data and the check constraint definition in the SYSIBM.SYSCHECKS catalog
table to determine why the INSERT, MERGE, DELETE, or UPDATE statement was rejected. The data must be
changed to satisfy the check constraint.
SQLSTATE: 23513
-546 THE CHECK CONSTRAINT constraint-name IS INVALID
Explanation: A check constraint in the CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement is invalid for one or more of the
following reasons:
v The constraint definition refers to a column that has a field procedure.
v The constraint definition refers to a column with a data type that is lower in the hierarchy of numeric data types
than the data type of any other operand. The hierarchy is as follows:
small integer < large integer < decimal
< single precision float
< double precision float
v The constraint definition refers to a column with a numeric data type that is not the same numeric data type as
that of the other column operands.
v The constraint definition refers to a column with a length that is shorter than the other operands when the column
and other operands are not character string data types.
v The constraint definition refers to a DECFLOAT column.
v The constraint definition refers to a built-in or user-defined function.
v The constraint definition uses a cast function that requires conversion of the data. The only functions that are
allowed in a check constraint are cast functions that do not require conversion of the data.
v The constraint contains an XML column
v The constraint definition contains an XMLQuery expression.
constraint-name
The name of the check constraint.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
For ALTER TABLE, the check constraint is not added to the object table. The definition of the table is unchanged.
For CREATE TABLE, the table is not created.
Programmer response: Correct the check constraint definition and execute the statement again.
SQLSTATE: 42621

-548 A CHECK CONSTRAINT THAT IS DEFINED WITH column-name IS INVALID
Explanation: A check constraint in the CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement is not valid for one or more of
the following reasons:
v The constraint definition refers to a column that has a field procedure.
v The constraint definition refers to a column with a data type that is lower in the hierarchy of numeric data types
than the data type of any other operand. The hierarchy is as follows:
small integer < large integer
< big integer < decimal
< single precision float
< double precision float
v The constraint definition refers to a column with a numeric data type that is not the same numeric data type as
that of the other column operands.
v The constraint definition refers to a column with a length that is shorter than the other operands when the column
and other operands are not character string data types.
v The constraint definition refers to a ROWID column.
v The constraint definition refers to a LOB column.
v The constraint definition refers to a DECFLOAT column.
v The constraint contains an XML column.
v The constraint definition contains an XMLQuery expression.
v An XMLQUERY or XMLEXISTS argument list contained two arguments with the same name.
v The generated column expression references a column for a column mask is defined.
v The constraint definition contains a built-in function that depends on the value of a special register.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
For ALTER TABLE, the check constraint is not added to the object table. The definition of the table is unchanged.
For CREATE TABLE, the table is not created.
Programmer response: Correct the check constraint definition, and execute the statement again.

-549 THE statement STATEMENT IS NOT ALLOWED FOR object_type1 object_name BECAUSE THE BIND OPTION DYNAMICRULES(RUN) IS NOT IN EFFECT FOR object_type2
Explanation: A program attempted to issue the indicated SQL statement that is one of several SQL statements that
cannot be issued from a plan or package for which the option DYNAMICRULES(RUN) is not in effect. Those SQL
statements are:
v Dynamic GRANT statement
v Dynamic REVOKE statement
v Dynamic ALTER statement
v Dynamic CREATE statement
v Dynamic DROP statement
The indicated SQL statement is bound to one of the following:
v The named plan or package that was not bound with the option DYNAMICRULES(RUN)
v The named package that was not bound with the DYNAMICRULES option, but is appended to a plan that was
not bound with DYNAMICRULES(RUN)
statement
The SQL statement in error
object_type1
PACKAGE or DBRM
object_name
If object_type1 is PACKAGE, object_name is the name of the package in the format 'location-id.collectionid.
package-id'.
If object_type1 is DBRM, object_name is the name of the DBRM in the format 'plan-name DBRM-name'.
object_type2
PLAN or PACKAGE
If object_type1 is PACKAGE, object_type2 can be either PACKAGE or PLAN (whichever is bound with a
DYNAMICRULES value other than RUN).
If object_type1 is DBRM, object_type2 is PLAN.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Take one of the following actions to correct the error:
v If the SQL statement is embedded, remove it, precompile and compile the application program again, and reissue
the BIND command with the appropriate DYNAMICRULES option.
v Use the SQL statement with a package or plan that is bound with DYNAMICRULES(RUN).
v Issue the REBIND command with the DYNAMICRULES(RUN) option for the plan or package to which the SQL
statement is bound.
Determine if either the SQL statement should be removed from the program or the plan or package should be
rebound with the DYNAMICRULES(RUN) option.

-551 auth-id DOES NOT HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO PERFORM OPERATION operation ON OBJECT object-name
Explanation: Authorization ID auth-id attempted to perform operation on object object-name without having been
granted the proper authority to do so. This error might also occur if the object is a read-only view (for insert, delete,
or update data change operation), or if auth-id is trying to create a table or view with an authorization ID other than
its own.
You can create a table from an auth-id other than your own only if your authorization ID is SYSADM, DBADM, or
DBCTRL. You can create a view from an auth-id other than your own only if your authorization ID is SYSADM.
If you are using a trusted context, the token auth-id might return a role instead of an authorization ID. A role is
returned if a role was in effect and the authorization checking is performed against the role, rather than the
authorization ID of the session, when the condition was encountered. Otherwise an authorization ID is returned. A
role is returned in the following format as a single token:
v ROLE: role-name
If you use the RACF access control module for authorization checking, auth-id might be different from the value
that is reported in message ICH408I. The ID that is reported in message ICH408I is the user ID that RACF used to
check the privilege.
In addition to the situations mentioned previously, this error can occur for the following situations:
v When operation is GRANT ***, the keyword ALL was used in the GRANT statement, but the grantor auth-id does
not have any privilege to grant.
v If operation is DROP PACKAGE, the object-name consists of the collection ID, the package name, and the consistency
token. The consistency token uniquely identifies the version of the package that the user does not have
authorization to drop.
v If operation is USAGE OF DISTINCT TYPE or USAGE OF JAR, the object-name identifies, respectively, the
DISTINCT TYPE or JAR for which the auth-id lacks USAGE privilege.
v If operation is ALTER JAR, the auth-id lacks ALTERIN privilege on the schema of the JAR object-name.
v If this error occurs while DB2 is creating or altering a table that involves referential constraints, this error message
reports that the user does not have the necessary ALTER privilege to perform a FOREIGN KEY, DROP FOREIGN
KEY, DROP PRIMARY KEY, or DROP UNIQUE operation. The object-name identifies the object table of the
CREATE or ALTER TABLE statement, not the table for which the user lacks the ALTER privilege.
v If this error occurs for a distributed SQL request, one of the following conditions can occur:
¨C If authorization ID translation is in effect for either the requesting DB2 site or the serving (responding) DB2 site,
then auth-id is the translated authorization ID. Refer to Part 3 (Volume 1) of the DB2 Administration Guide for
information on authorization ID translation.
¨C If an alias name was used in the SQL statement, the object-name is the resolved remote table name or view name.
v If this error occurs during invocation of a routine, the authorization ID auth-id does not have the EXECUTE
privilege on any candidate routine in the SQL path. The variable for object-name is the name of a candidate routine
in the SQL path.
v An object does not exist, and the CURRENT RULES special register is set to STD.
v If the access control authorization exit routine is active and the authorization ID of the process does not have the
necessary privileges, this error might occur for packages that are bound with the DYNAMICRULES(BIND) option
when authorization caching, statement caching, or both are enabled.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: To correct the error, verify the following situations:
v The auth-id has the authority to perform the operation.
v The object-name exists.
v The auth-id is not trying to create a table with a schema qualifier that is not the same as auth-id.
SQLSTATE: 42501
-552 authorization-id DOES NOT HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO PERFORM OPERATION operation
Explanation: An operation was attempted by an authorization ID that lacks the required authority.
authorization-id
The authorization ID that attempted to perform the operation.
If you are using a trusted context, the authorization-id value might be a role instead of an authorization ID. A
role is returned if a role was in effect and the authorization checking is performed against the role, rather
than the authorization ID of the session, when the condition was encountered. Otherwise an authorization
ID is returned. A role is returned in the following format as a single token:
ROLE: role-name DOES NOT HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO PERFORM OPERATION operation
operation
The operation that was attempted.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Administrator response: Check for an attempted authorization violation.
Programmer response: Ensure that the authorization ID has been granted the authority necessary to perform the
operation.
SECADM authority is required to revoke any of the following:
v System DBADM authority
v DATAACCESS authority
v ACCESSCTRL authority
v CREATE_SECURE_OBJECT privilege
SQLSTATE: 42502
-553 authorization-id SPECIFIED IS NOT ONE OF THE VALID AUTHORIZATION IDS FOR REQUESTED OPERATION
Explanation: The statement failed for one of the following reasons:
v The authorization ID specified as the value of authorization-id or host variable in the SQL SET CURRENT SQLID
statement is neither the user's primary authorization ID nor one of the associated secondary authorization IDs.
v The authorization ID specified as the value of the PACKAGE OWNER option for a CREATE or ALTER
PROCEDURE statement is neither the user's primary authorization ID nor one of the associated secondary
authorization IDs.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Change the authorization-id to a value that the user can use.
SQLSTATE: 42503
-554 AN AUTHORIZATION ID OR ROLE CANNOT GRANT A PRIVILEGE TO ITSELF
Explanation: An authorization ID or a role attempted to execute a GRANT statement in which that ID itself appears
as one of the entries in the list of 'grantee' authorization IDs or role names.
An authorization ID or a role cannot GRANT a privilege to itself. However, if SQLRULES(STD) is in effect or
CURRENT RULES contains STD, GRANT to self is allowed.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No privileges were granted.
Programmer response: Remove the reference to the authorization ID that issued the GRANT statement from the list
of grantee authorization IDs.

-555 AN AUTHORIZATION ID OR ROLE CANNOT REVOKE A PRIVILEGE FROM ITSELF
Explanation: An authorization ID or a role attempted to execute a REVOKE statement in which that ID itself
appears as one of the entries in the list of authorization IDs or role names to be revoked.
An authorization ID or a role cannot REVOKE its own privilege. However, if SQLRULES(STD) is in effect or
CURRENT RULES contains STD, REVOKE from self is allowed.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No privileges were revoked.
Programmer response: Take one of the following actions and reissue the REVOKE statement:
v Remove the authorization ID that issues the REVOKE statement from the list of authorization IDs to be revoked.
v Issue the REVOKE statement from a different authorization ID.

-556 revoke-target CANNOT HAVE THE privilege PRIVILEGE object-name REVOKED BY revoker-id BECAUSE THE REVOKEE DOES NOT POSSESS THE PRIVILEGE OR THE REVOKER DID NOT MAKE THE GRANT
Explanation: The REVOKE statement was not successful.
revoke-target
The authorization ID that the revoke attempt was made against.
privilege
The name of the privilege that was to be revoked.
object-name
The name of the object that the privilege applies to.
revoker-id
The authorization ID that attempted to revoke the privilege.
If you are using a trusted context, the tokens revoke-target and revoker-id might return a role instead of an
authorization ID. A role is returned if a role was in effect and the authorization checking is performed against the
role, rather than the authorization ID of the session, when the condition was encountered. Otherwise an
authorization ID is returned. A role is returned in the following format as a single token:
ROLE: role-name
A failed revocation attempt is commonly caused by one or more of the following conditions:
v The authorization ID that was the target of the REVOKE statement, revoke-target, does not possess the privilege that
was to be revoked.
v The revoking authorization ID, revoker-id, did not explicitly grant the privilege to revoke-target. An authorization ID
can revoke only the privileges that it has explicitly granted to other authorization IDs, unless the authorization ID
has SECADM or ACCESSCTRL authority and specifies the BY clause.
v The authorization ID revoke-target is the owner of the specified object. No authorization ID, not even SECADM, can
revoke privileges on an object from the object owner.
v If privilege is ¡°***¡±: The keyword ALL was used in the REVOKE statement, but revoke-target did not possess any
privilege to revoke.
v If revoker-id is ¡°ALL¡±: The BY ALL clause was used in the REVOKE statement, but revoke-target did not possess any
privilege to revoke.
v If revoker-id holds SECADM or ACCESSCTRL authority: The BY clause might have been omitted from the REVOKE
statement.
System action: The statement was not executed. No privileges were revoked from any authorization ID.
Programmer response: Check the appropriate authorization catalog tables to verify that revoke-target possesses the
privilege to be revoked. Issue a query with GRANTEE set to the value in revoke-target and the privilege column not
equal to blanks. Correct and reissue the REVOKE statement.
SQLSTATE: 42504
-557 INCONSISTENT GRANT/REVOKE KEYWORD keyword. PERMITTED KEYWORDS ARE keyword-list
Explanation: The GRANT or REVOKE statement contains a syntax or spelling error at or before the specified
'keyword'. As an aid to the programmer, 'keyword-list' provides a list of the keywords that would be permitted in
this context.
Alternatively:
v The mixture of privileges specified on the GRANT or REVOKE statement is not permitted. The privileges must all
be of one type, and consistent with the form of the GRANT or REVOKE statement.
v REVOKE UPDATE (column-list) is not permitted; only REVOKE UPDATE is valid.
v The keywords DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, TRIGGER, UPDATE, REFERENCES and ALTER cannot be specified for
an auxiliary table.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the syntax of the GRANT or REVOKE statement.
SQLSTATE: 42852
-559 ALL AUTHORIZATION FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN DISABLED
Explanation: The authorization mechanism has been disabled in the DB2 subsystem. Consequently, GRANT and
REVOKE statements are ignored.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No privileges were granted or revoked.
Programmer response: Do not attempt to execute GRANT or REVOKE statements unless and until the authorization
mechanism is enabled in the DB2 subsystem.
SQLSTATE: 57002
-562 THE SPECIFIED PRIVILEGES CANNOT BE GRANTED TO PUBLIC.
Explanation: The GRANT statement attempted to grant one of the following privileges to the reserved authorization
ID PUBLIC (public):
v System DBADM
v DATAACCESS
v ACCESSCTRL
v CREATE_SECURE_OBJECT
These privileges cannot be granted to PUBLIC (public).
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the statement to specify a privilege that can be granted to PUBLIC, or specify a
grantee other than PUBLIC.

-567 bind-type AUTHORIZATION ERROR USING auth-id AUTHORITY PACKAGE = package-name PRIVILEGE = privilege
Explanation: The authorization ID given does not have the privilege indicated, and cannot invoke the indicated
subcommand against the indicated package.
bind-type
Type of bind subcommand (BIND | REBIND | FREE).
auth-id Authorization ID of the package owner.
package-name
Name of the package (location.collection.package.version)
privilege
Name of the privilege not held:
v BINDADD¡ªThe authority to create a new package using BIND with the ADD option.
v BIND¡ªThe authority to BIND (REPLACE) or REBIND a package.
v COPY¡ªThe authority to COPY from the indicated package
v CREATE IN¡ªThe authority to create a package in the indicated collection.
If you are using a trusted context, the token auth-id might return a role instead of an authorization ID. A role is
returned if a role was in effect and the authorization checking is performed against the role, rather than the
authorization ID of the session, when the condition was encountered. Otherwise an authorization ID is returned. A
role is returned in the following format as a single token:
v ROLE: role-name
System action: The indicated package is not bound, rebound, or freed.
System programmer response: The indicated privilege must be granted to the authorization ID that will become the
package owner.
SQLSTATE: 42501
-571 THE STATEMENT WOULD RESULT IN A MULTIPLE SITE UPDATE
Explanation: This SQLCODE is issued in the following situations:
v When an application program operating in an IMS or CICS environment attempts to modify data at a remote
location where multi-site update capabilities are not supported.
v When an application program has explicit SQL statements within a commit scope that would result in updates at
multiple sites where one of the sites at which data is being updated does not support multi-site update.
This SQLCODE can be issued when an application program explicitly modifies data at a single location within a
commit scope. This can occur in the following situations:
v A package that is associated with the application program was invalidated.
v A package or plan was bound at one release of DB2 and fallback occurs to a prior release.
In the situations described above, an implicit autobind is done on behalf of the user. An autobind results in the DB2
catalog being updated. The conditions that must exist for this SQLCODE to be issued when an autobind occurs are:
v One site where data has been modified does not support multi-site update.
v The autobind occurs at a separate and distinct site from where an application program explicitly modifies data.
v At the time of the autobind, locks are being held to process an SQL statement within the application program.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response:
v Ensure that all requests for modifications to the data are confined to a single location within any given commit
scope for any application that references a location that does not support multi-site update.
v For programs operating in an IMS or CICS environment where the remote database systems do not support
multi-site update, all SQL statements must be read-only access.
v If an autobind is causing this SQLCODE to be issued, REBIND the plan or package.

-573 TABLE table-name DOES NOT HAVE A UNIQUE KEY WITH THE SPECIFIED COLUMN NAMES
Explanation: A referential constraint cannot be defined with the specified table as the parent because a unique index
with the specified column names does not exist for the identified parent table.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Create a unique index with the specified columns for the parent table.
SQLSTATE: 42890
-574 THE SPECIFIED DEFAULT VALUE OR IDENTITY ATTRIBUTE VALUE CONFLICTS WITH THE DEFINITION OF COLUMN column-name
Explanation: A value specified for a column is not valid.
column-name
The name of the column.
Possible reasons for this error include:
v The value is not assignable to the column because the constant does not conform to the format for a constant of
that data type, or the value has the incorrect length or precision.
v A floating-point constant is specified and the column is not a floating point data type.
v A decimal constant is specified and non-zero digits would be truncated when assigned to the column.
v The value is more than 255 bytes, including quotation marks for strings, introducer characters such as the X for a
hex constant, fully qualified function names, and parentheses.
v Either the USER, or SESSION_USER, or CURRENT SQLID special register is specified and the length attribute of
the character string column is not sufficient to store a value that is 8 characters when the value is expressed in
CCSID 37.
v A system-generated cast function was specified and the column is not defined with a user-defined distinct type.
v A function was specified that is not supported. A function can be specified only when the data type is a distinct
type, and in this case the specified function must be one of the system-generated cast functions associated with
this distinct type.
v A value with non-zero scale was specified for the START WITH or INCREMENT BY option of an identity column
with the DECIMAL data type.
v A decimal floating point (DECFLOAT) constant is specified. A decimal floating point cannot be restricted to zero
scale numbers and, as such, may not be used in IDENTITY columns.
v WITH DEFAULT is specified using a value other than NULL for a LOB column without INLINE LENGTH
attribute.
v The length of the default value is greater than the INLINE LENGTH attribute of the LOB column.
v A default value was specified for a timestamp with time zone column but the default value does not contain a
time zone.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Specify a default value that is valid for the definition of the column, and reissue the
statement.
SQLSTATE: 42894
-575 OBJECT object-name (OBJECT TYPE object-type) CANNOT BE REFERENCED EXPLICITLY OR IMPLICITLY
Explanation: The statement referenced an object, but the object cannot be used as requested.
object-name
The name of the referenced object.
object-type
The type of object that was referenced. Possible values include:
VIEW An alteration was made to a table that underlies the object-name view, which caused the view
definition to become invalid. The view must be successfully regenerated with an ALTER VIEW
statement before it can be referenced in a statement other than ALTER VIEW, GRANT, REVOKE,
DROP, COMMENT, or LABEL. Issue an ALTER VIEW statement to regenerate the view.
ROW PERMISSION
The object-name row permission is invalid because a previous attempt to regenerate it was
unsuccessful. The row permission must be disabled before the row access control enforced table can
be referenced. To correct the invalid state, the row permission must be dropped and re-created with
a modified definition.
COLUMN MASK
The object-name column mask is invalid because a previous attempt to regenerate it was
unsuccessful. The column mask must be disabled before the column access control enforced table
can be referenced. To correct the invalid state, the column mask must be dropped and re-created
with a modified definition.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Take the suggested corrective action.
SQLSTATE: 51024
-577 object-type object-name ATTEMPTED TO MODIFY DATA WHEN THE DEFINITION OF THE FUNCTION OR PROCEDURE DID NOT SPECIFY THIS ACTION
Explanation: The current environment does not allow SQL statements that modify data. One of the following
situations has occurred:
v A user-defined function or stored procedure object-name was invoked and attempted to modify data, but the
function or procedure was defined without the MODIFIES SQL option.
v A user-defined function or stored procedure object-name was invoked and attempted to execute a data definition
statement, but the function or procedure was defined without the MODIFIES SQL option.
v A function or procedure defined with READS SQL DATA, CONTAINS SQL, or NO SQL has attempted to invoke
another function or procedure defined with MODIFIES SQL DATA.
v A user-defined function or stored procedure object-name was invoked and attempted to use a NEXT VALUE
expression. However, the function or procedure was defined without the MODIFIES SQL DATA option.
In an environment of nested functions and procedures, the SQL option in effect is the most restrictive one that has
been specified in the nested hierarchy of functions and procedures. The SQL data access option in effect does not
allow for modifying the data.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Either use an ALTER statement to change the definition of the function or procedure to
allow statements that modify data, or remove the failing SQL statement from the external function or procedure.
SQLSTATE: 38002
-578 THE RETURN STATEMENT WAS NOT EXECUTED FOR SQL FUNCTION function-name.
Explanation: The SQL function reached the end of the routine body without executing a RETURN statement.
function-name
The name of the function.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Add a RETURN statement to the function routine body, and try the request again.
SQLSTATE: 2F005
-579 object-type object-name ATTEMPTED TO READ DATA WHEN THE DEFINITION OF THE FUNCTION OR PROCEDURE DID NOT SPECIFY THIS ACTION
Explanation: The current environment does not allow SQL statements that read data. One of the following situations
had occurred:
v A user-defined function or stored procedure object-name was invoked and attempted to read data, but the function
or procedure was defined without the READS SQL DATA or MODIFIES SQL DATA option.
v A function or procedure defined with CONTAINS SQL or NO SQL has attempted to invoke another function or
procedure defined with READS SQL DATA.
In an environment of nested functions and procedures, the SQL option in effect is the most restrictive one that has
been specified in the nested hierarchy of functions and procedures. The SQL data access option in effect does not
allow for reading data.
System action: The SQL statement failed.
Programmer response: Either use an ALTER statement to change the definition of the function or procedure to
allow statements that read data, or remove the failing SQL statement from the external function or procedure.
SQLSTATE: 38004
-580 THE RESULT-EXPRESSIONS OF A CASE EXPRESSION CANNOT ALL BE NULL
Explanation: There is a CASE expression in the statement that has all the result-expressions (expressions following the
THEN and ELSE keywords) coded with the keyword NULL.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the CASE expression to include at least one result-expression with a keyword other
than NULL.
SQLSTATE: 42625
-581 THE DATA TYPES OF THE RESULT-EXPRESSIONS OF A CASE EXPRESSION ARE NOT COMPATIBLE
Explanation: There is a CASE expression in the statement that has result-expressions (expressions following THEN
and ELSE keywords) that are not compatible. The data type of the result-expressions might be incompatible because
the CASE condition result data types are not all:
v character
v graphic
v numeric
v date
v time
v timestamp
v binary string
If encoded in Unicode, character and graphic data types are compatible, however.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the result-expressions so that they are compatible.
SQLSTATE: 42804
-582 THE SEARCH-CONDITION IN A SEARCHED-WHEN-CLAUSE OF A CASE IS NOT VALID IN THE CONTEXT IN WHICH IT WAS SPECIFIED. THE SEARCH CONDITION CONTAINS A QUANTIFIED PREDICATE OR AN IN PREDICATE THAT INCLUDES A FULLSELECT, AND THESE ARE NOT ALLOWED IN THE SPECIFIED CONTEXT.
Explanation: The search-condition in a searched-when-clause specifies a quantified predicate, an IN predicate, or an
EXISTS predicate, but is not allowed. However, an IN predicate is allowed within a select list or VALUES clause if
that IN predicate explicitly includes a list of expressions.
The search-condition in a searched-when-clause specifies a quantified predicate or an IN predicate that includes a
fullselect. A CASE specification that includes either of these cannot be used in the following contexts:
v A SELECT list
v A VALUES clause of an INSERT or MERGE statement
v A SET or assignment clause of an UPDATE, MERGE, or DELETE statement
v The right side of a SET or an assignment statement
v A column mask or row permission definition
The search-condition in a searched-when-clause specified an EXISTS predicate. A CASE specification that includes either
of these cannot be used in the following contexts:
v A VALUES clause of an INSERT or MERGE statement
v The right side of a SET or an assignment statement
v The diagnostic-string-expression of a SIGNAL statement
v The expression of a VALUES statement
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the syntax, and reissue the statement.
SQLSTATE: 42625
-583 THE USE OF FUNCTION OR EXPRESSION name IS INVALID BECAUSE IT IS NOT DETERMINISTIC OR HAS AN EXTERNAL ACTION
Explanation: The function name is defined as a non-deterministic function or a function with an external action, or
the expression name is defined as a non-deterministic expression. This type of function or expression is not supported
in the context in which it is used. The contexts in which these are not valid are:
v In the expression prior to the first WHEN keyword in a simple-case-expression.
v In the WHERE clause of the subselect in a CREATE VIEW statement if the WITH CHECK OPTION is specified.
v In an expression of an ORDER BY clause
v In a key-expression of an index definition
v In an expression of a GROUP BY clause
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If the use of a non-deterministic or external action function or expression was not intended,
substitute a function or expression without these characteristics. If the behavior associated with the non-deterministic
or external action function or expression is intentional, use the alternate form of the statements that make that intent
explicit.
v Instead of a simple-when-clause, use the corresponding searched-when-clause where the function or expression
would be specified in each search-condition.
v Remove the WITH CHECK OPTION from the CREATE VIEW statement.
v Remove the function or expression from the GROUP BY clause.
v Remove the function or expression from the ORDER BY clause. If the column is part of the result set of the query,
change the expression in the ORDER BY clause to the simple-integer or simple-column-name form of the sort key.
SQLSTATE: 42845
-584 INVALID USE OF NULL
Explanation: The NULL keyword is not valid as specified. One of the following error situations occurred:
v The NULL keyword was used in the USING source-table clause of the MERGE statement, but the NULL keyword
was not explicitly cast to a supported data type.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Take the following action:
v Specify the NULL keyword within a CAST expression when using NULL within the USING VALUES clause of the
MERGE statement.
SQLSTATE: 42608
-585 THE COLLECTION collection-id APPEARS MORE THAN ONCE IN THE SET special-register STATEMENT
Explanation: The SET statement for special register special-register includes collection-id more than once.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Remove duplicate occurrences of collection-id from the SET statement for the special register.
SQLSTATE: 42732
-586 THE TOTAL LENGTH OF THE CURRENT PATH SPECIAL REGISTER CANNOT EXCEED 2048 CHARACTERS
Explanation: The CURRENT PATH special register is defined as a VARCHAR(2048). The content of the string
includes each schema name delimited with double quotes and sepa- rated from the next schema name by a comma.
The total length of the string of all schema names in the CURRENT PATH cannot exceed 2048 characters. A SET
PATH statement causing this message would exceed this limit.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Remove schema names to reduce the total length to fit the 2048 character maximum length.
If all the schema names are required, it may be necessary to consolidate some user-defined functions so that fewer
schema names are required for the CURRENT PATH.
SQLSTATE: 42907
-589 A POSITIONED DELETE OR UPDATE STATEMENT FOR CURSOR cursor-name SPECIFIED A ROW OF A ROWSET, BUT THE CURSOR IS NOT POSITIONED ON A ROWSET
Explanation: The FOR ROW n OF ROWSET clause was specified on a positioned DELETE or UPDATE statement,
but the cursor is not currently positioned on a rowset.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Issue a FETCH statement to position the cursor on the correct rowset, and then reissue the
positioned DELETE or UPDATE statement. If the cursor is not defined for rowset access, redefine the cursor first.
SQLSTATE: 24520
-590 NAME name IS NOT UNIQUE IN THE CREATE OR ALTER FOR ROUTINE routine-name
Explanation: The name that is specified for a parameter, SQL variable, cursor, label, or condition in a CREATE or
ALTER statement for a routine is not unique.
name The item name that is not unique within the routine.
routine-name
The name of the routine that contains the duplicate item names.
The value for name must adhere to the following rules:
v A parameter name must be unique within the parameter list.
v An SQL variable name must be unique within the compound statement in which it is declared, excluding any
declarations within compound statements that are nested within the compound statement that declares the SQL
variable.
v An SQL variable name must not be the same as a parameter name.
v A cursor name must be unique within the procedure body in which it is declared, excluding any declaration
within compound statements that are nested within the compound statement that declares the cursor.
v A condition name must be unique within the compound statement in which it is declared, excluding any
declarations within compound statements that are nested within the compound statement that declares the
condition.
v A label must be unique within a compound statement, including any labels within compound statements that are
nested within the compound statement that defines the label.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the name so that it is unique.
SQLSTATE: 42734
-592 NOT AUTHORIZED TO CREATE FUNCTIONS OR PROCEDURES IN WLM ENVIRONMENT env-name
Explanation: This message is issued when the check for authorization to the WLM application environment in
env-name token failed.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: To correct the error, choose a different value for the WLM ENVIRONMENT keyword or
request authorization to create objects in the specified WLM ENVIRONMENT from the system administrator. Then,
reissue the SQL statement.
SQLSTATE: 42510
-593 NOT NULL MUST BE SPECIFIED FOR column-name BECAUSE IT IS DEFINED AS A ROWID (OR DISTINCT TYPE FOR ROWID), ROW CHANGE TIMESTAMP COLUMN, ROW BEGIN COLUMN, ROW END COLUMN, OR COLUMN OF A PERIOD column-name
Explanation: The NOT NULL clause was specified for a column whose type does not permit null values.
column-name
The name of the column that requires the NOT NULL clause.
The following columns do not permit null values:
v ROWID columns
v Distinct type columns for which the source type is ROWID
v Row change timestamp columns
v Row begin columns and row end columns
v Columns of a period
When one of these columns is defined on a CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, or DECLARE TABLE statement, the
NOT NULL clause must be specified for the column.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the statement to specify the NOT NULL clause.
SQLSTATE: 42831

-594 ATTEMPT TO CREATE A NULLABLE ROWID OR DISTINCT TYPE COLUMN column-name
Explanation: A CREATE VIEW statement attempted to create a new view with a nullable ROWID column. ROWID
columns (or distinct type columns for which the source type is a ROWID) do not support null values. One of the
following situations has occurred:
v The subselect of a CREATE VIEW statement involves an outer join for which a column of the result table is a
ROWID column that needs to allow for null values.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the content of the statement so that it does not try to create a ROWID column which
must allow for null values.
SQLSTATE: 42831
-601 THE NAME (VERSION OR VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER) OF THE OBJECT TO BE DEFINED OR THE TARGET OF A RENAME STATEMENT IS IDENTICAL TO THE EXISTING NAME (VERSION OR VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER) object-name OF THE OBJECT TYPE object-type
Explanation: An attempt to name an object failed because the name is already in use for an object of the same type.
object-name
The name of the object.
object-type
The type of object.
This message is issued in response to multiple SQL statements:
ALTER statements
An ALTER statement attempted to alter an object.
object-type=TABLE
An ALTER statement attempted to add a clone table, but an object of the same type with the same
name already exists in the catalog table SYSIBM.SYSPENDINGOBJECTS.
object-type=VERSION
An ALTER statement attempted to define a new version of a routine and specified a version
identifier that already exists for the specified routine.
object-type=VOLUME
An ALTER statement attempted to add a volume name to a storage group, but a volume with
volume serial number already exists for the storage group.
CREATE statements
A CREATE statement attempted to create an object object-name of type object-type, but an object of that type
with the same name is already defined in the DB2 subsystem.
A CREATE statement failed because an object of the same type with the same name already exists in the
catalog table SYSIBM.SYSPENDINGOBJECTS.
object-type=CONSTRAINT
The object name was specified in the FOREIGN KEY clause, CHECK clause, PRIMARY KEY clause,
or UNIQUE clause of either a CREATE or ALTER TABLE statement. All referential integrity, check
constraint, primary key, and unique key constraint names defined on a table must be unique.
object-type=DISTINCT TYPE
If a CREATE DISTINCT TYPE statement failed, a user-defined type already exists with the same
name as the distinct type name specified in the CREATE DISTINCT TYPE statement.
object-type=FUNCTION
If a CREATE FUNCTION statement failed, a routine already exists with the same name as the name
specified in the CREATE FUNCTION statement. If a CREATE DISTINCT TYPE statement failed, a
user-defined function already exists with the same name as the distinct type that is specified in the
CREATE DISTINCT TYPE statement.
object-type=INDEX
If a CREATE INDEX statement failed, an index already exists with the same name as the name
specified in the CREATE INDEX statement.
object-type=JAR
If an invocation of procedure SQLJ.INSTALL_JAR failed, a JAR already exists with the same name
as the name specified on the invocation of procedure SQLJ.INSTALL_JAR.
object-type=MASK
If a CREATE MASK statement failed, the column mask name identifies a column mask that already
exists at the current server.
object-type=PERMISSION
If a CREATE PERMISSION statement failed, the row permission name identifies a row permission
that already exists at the current server.
object-type=PROCEDURE
If a CREATE PROCEDURE statement failed, a routine already exists with the same name as the
name specified in the CREATE PROCEDURE statement. If the CREATE PROCEDURE statement for
an SQL procedure failed, then an SQL procedure might already with the same name as the external
name that was implicitly or explicitly specified.
If the error was encountered for a particular version of a native SQL procedure, the object-name
token might return the name and version of the procedure, in the following format:
procedure-name VERSION version-id
.
object-type=ROLE
If a CREATE ROLE statement failed, a role already exists with the same name as the name specified
in the CREATE ROLE statement.
object-type=SEQUENCE
If a CREATE SEQUENCE statement failed, a sequence already exists with the same name as the
sequence name that was specified in the CREATE SEQUENCE statement.
object-type=TABLE
If a CREATE ALIAS statement failed, the alias name specified in the CREATE ALIAS statement is
identical to the table name or view name specified. The table might not exist in the DB2 subsystem.
object-type=TRUSTED CONTEXT
If a CREATE TRUSTED CONTEXT statement failed, a trusted context already exists with the same
name as the name specified in the CREATE TRUSTED CONTEXT statement.
object-type=VIEW
If a CREATE ALIAS statement failed, the alias name specified in the CREATE ALIAS statement is
identical to the table name or view name specified. The view might not exist in the DB2 subsystem.
object-type=XSR SCHEMA
If an invocation of procedure SYSPROC.XSR_REGISTER failed, an XSR XML schema already exists
with the same name as the name specified on the invocation of procedure
SYSPROC.XSR_REGISTER.
RENAME statements
An object with the same name as the target name already exists in the catalog table
SYSIBM.SYSPENDINGOBJECTS.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Either drop or remove the existing object or choose another name.
If the object-type is a data set, consider one of the following actions:
v Verify that the correct integrated catalog facility catalog is specified in the storage group definition. The ICF catalog
is identified in the VCATNAME column of SYSIBM.SYSSTOGROUP catalog table.
v Issue an IDCAMS DELETE of the data set before retrying the CREATE statement.

-602 TOO MANY COLUMNS, PERIODS, OR KEY-EXPRESSIONS SPECIFIED IN A CREATE INDEX OR ALTER INDEX STATEMENT
Explanation: One of the following specifications in a CREATE INDEX or ALTER INDEX statement exceeds the
permitted maximum value of 64:
v The sum of the number of columns and twice the number of identified periods:
columns + (2
¡Á periods)
v The number of key-expressions.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Modify the index definition to conform to the system-imposed column or key-expression
limit of 64.
SQLSTATE: 54008

Statements (DB2 SQL)
-603 A UNIQUE INDEX CANNOT BE CREATED BECAUSE THE TABLE CONTAINS ROWS WHICH ARE DUPLICATES WITH RESPECT TO THE VALUES OF THE IDENTIFIED COLUMNS AND PERIODS
Explanation: The index that is defined in the CREATE INDEX statement could not be created as unique because the
specified table already contains rows that are duplicates with respect to the values of the identified columns and
periods.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Examine the data to determine whether or not the duplicate data is valid. Alternatively,
consider creating a nonunique index.
SQLSTATE: 23515

CREATE INDEX (DB2 SQL)
-604 A DATA TYPE DEFINITION SPECIFIES AN INVALID LENGTH, PRECISION, OR SCALE ATTRIBUTE
Explanation: A data type definition in a CREATE or ALTER statement is incorrect in one of the following ways:
v The data type definition contains an invalid length, precision, or scale attribute specification.
v The specification of the data type might be incorrect or invalid.
v The column definition in a view referenced in a CREATE TABLE LIKE view statement has an invalid length.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The specified object was not created or altered.
Programmer response: Correct the statement syntax as follows, and resubmit the statement:
v Correct the data type definition in the statement to have a valid length, precision, or scale attribute.
v Ensure that the specified data types are valid for the CREATE or ALTER statement.
v Correct the invalid length in the column definition of the view that is referenced in the CREATE TABLE LIKE
statement.
SQLSTATE: 42611

Data types (DB2 SQL)
-607 OPERATION OR OPTION operation IS NOT DEFINED FOR THIS OBJECT
Explanation: The operation or option cannot be performed on the object specified in the SQL statement.
Examples:
v LOGGED and NOT LOGGED cannot be set when you create or alter a table space in the DB2 catalog (DSNDB06)
database.
v Catalog and directory objects cannot be cloned.
v A period specification must not be used if the table reference is not a table.
v The operation is a SELECT statement, and a target of the operation is a directory object. DB2 cannot convert the
SELECT statement to the UR isolation level. For example, the following SQL statement cannot be executed because
the SELECT operation against directory object SYSIBM.SYSLGRNX cannot be converted to the UR isolation level:
UPDATE T1 SET C1 = (SELECT C1 FROM T1)
WHERE EXISTS(
SELECT LGRDBID FROM SYSIBM.SYSLGRNX);
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If an option of the SQL statement is not allowed for this object, modify the SQL statement
and resubmit the statement. If an operation is not defined for the object, the statement cannot be executed.
SQLSTATE: 42832
-611 ONLY LOCKMAX 0 CAN BE SPECIFIED WHEN THE LOCK SIZE OF THE TABLESPACE IS TABLESPACE OR TABLE
Explanation: This message is issued when:
v The LOCKSIZE of the table space is TABLESPACE or TABLE, and LOCKMAX is being altered to or created as a
nonzero value.
v The LOCKSIZE of the table space is being altered to TABLESPACE or TABLE, and LOCKMAX is being altered to
or created as a nonzero value.
If LOCKSIZE is TABLESPACE or TABLE, LOCKMAX must be 0 because lock escalation is not supported from these
levels.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Do one of the following:
v Reissue the statement with LOCKMAX 0.
v Alter the LOCKSIZE of the table space to a value other than TABLESPACE or TABLE.
SQLSTATE: 53088
-612 identifier IS A DUPLICATE NAME
Explanation: A non-unique name was specified where a unique name is required. Column and period names must
be unique within an index, a table, or a view, and in the UPDATE OF clause of a trigger definition.
identifier
The non-unique name.
Possible causes for this error include:
CREATE INDEX and ALTER INDEX statements
v The same column name is specified for two or more columns of the index.
CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements
v The same column name is specified for two or more columns of the table.
v A constraint specifies an XML column and the constraint definition contains an expression that invokes
the XMLQUERY function or uses the XMLEXISTS predicate.
v The same period name is specified for two or more columns of the table.
v The same period is specified more than one time in the constraint.
v A period and a column are defined with the same name.
v For a CREATE TABLE statement, a column list of a PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, or UNIQUE clause
contains two or more occurrences of the same column name.
v A column is specified more than once in an ALTER TABLE statement. With only one exception, a column
cannot be specified in multiple clauses of an ALTER TABLE statement. The exception is when the two
clauses are ALTER COLUMN and ADD CHECK CONSTRAINT.
CREATE VIEW statements
v The same column name is specified for two or more columns of the view
CREATE TRIGGER statements
v For a CREATE TRIGGER statement, the UPDATE OF clause specifies the same column name more than
once.
XMLQUERY function or XMLEXISTS predicate
v The PASSING clause of an XMLQUERY function or an XMLEXISTS predicate contains two arguments
with the same name.
v An XMLQUERY or XMLEXISTS argument list contains two arguments with the same name.
SQL data change statements
v The SQL data change statement uses an include column, and the column name that is specified is the
same as another column name of the target table or view, or of another include column.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the statement syntax, and reissue the statement.
SQLSTATE: 42711

Statements (DB2 SQL)
-613 THE PRIMARY KEY OR A HASH KEY OR A UNIQUE CONSTRAINT IS TOO LONG OR HAS TOO MANY COLUMNS AND PERIODS
Explanation: The number of columns and periods that are defined for a PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraint is
too large. Both of the following conditions must be met:
v The total of the number of columns and two times the number of identified periods must not exceed 64.
v The sum of the column length attributes of the identified columns and the begin and end columns of any
identified periods must not exceed the permitted limit for the type of constraint.
If the failing statement was an ALTER TABLE statement that included the SET DATA TYPE clause to alter the
definition of an existing column, a column being changed is part of a unique or primary constraint. The new sum of
the lengths of the columns of the keys exceeds 255-n, where n is the number of columns allowing null values. This
sum currently exceeds the maximum number that is allowed.
If the failing statement was an ALTER TABLE statement with a PARTITIONING KEY specification, only 64 columns
can be specified, and the combined lengths of all columns specified in the PARTITIONING KEY clause exceeds the
maximum length of 255-n, where n is the number of columns that can contain null values.
The failing statement might have been either CREATE TABLE with an ORGANIZE BY HASH specification or an
ALTER TABLE with an ADD ORGANIZE BY HASH specification.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the table definition to keep within the prescribed limits.
SQLSTATE: 54008
-614 THE INDEX CANNOT BE CREATED OR ALTERED, OR THE LENGTH OF A COLUMN CANNOT BE CHANGED BECAUSE THE SUM OF THE INTERNAL LENGTHS OF THE COLUMNS FOR THE INDEX IS GREATER THAN THE ALLOWABLE MAXIMUM
Explanation: The index could not be created or the length of a column cannot be changed because the sum of the
internal lengths of the key columns would exceed the allowable maximum. The maximum permitted key length is as
follows:
v For PADDED indexes, the sum of the length attributes of the columns must not be greater than 2000-n, where n is
the number of columns that contain null values.
v For NOT PADDED indexes, the sum of the length attributes of the columns must not be greater than 2000-n-2m,
where n is the number of nullable columns and m is the number of varying length columns.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The specified index was not created or the length of the column
was not changed.
Programmer response: The definition for the index must be modified (possibly by eliminating one or more key
columns) to reduce the length of the key to the permitted maximum.

-615 operation-type IS NOT ALLOWED ON A PACKAGE IN USE
Explanation: The operation cannot be performed because the package is in use by the same application process.
operation-type
Type of bind operation (BIND, REBIND or DROP).
System action: The BIND, REBIND, or DROP operation on the package is not performed.
Programmer response: Change the application to invoke the BIND, REBIND or DROP operation when the package
is not in use by the same application process.
SQLSTATE: 55006
-616 obj-type1 obj-name1 CANNOT BE DROPPED BECAUSE IT IS REFERENCED BY obj-type2 obj-name2
Explanation: Some types of objects cannot be dropped if there are other objects which are dependent upon them.
For example, a storage group cannot be dropped if there are one or more existing table spaces that use that storage
group.
Execution of the specified DROP statement would drop object obj-name1 of type obj-type1 on which object obj-name2 of
type obj-type2 is dependent.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The specified object was not dropped.
Programmer response: Verify that the object specified in the DROP statement was, indeed, the object to be dropped.
If so, all the existing objects that have a dependency on that object must first be dropped.
A LOB table space cannot be dropped when an association exists between it and another table space. The associated
base table must be dropped first.
A populated auxiliary table and its index can only be dropped by dropping the associated base table.
A trigger package cannot be explicitly dropped. It can only be dropped by dropping the associated trigger with a
DROP TRIGGER statement or by dropping the triggering table.
SQLSTATE: 42893
-618 OPERATION operation IS NOT ALLOWED ON SYSTEM DATABASES
Explanation: System databases cannot be the object of certain types of operations. The attempted operation cannot be
performed on system databases. Possible reasons are:
v CCSID ASCII was specified when a system database was being created.
v APPEND was specified when a system database was being created.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No changes were made to the specified system database.
User response: Do not attempt to perform the requested operation on system databases.
SQLSTATE: 42832
-619 OPERATION DISALLOWED BECAUSE THE DATABASE IS NOT STOPPED
Explanation: The statements CREATE, ALTER or DROP for a table space, table, or index in the database cannot be
processed unless the database is stopped (using the STOP command).
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Issue the -DISPLAY DATABASE command to verify that the RTS database is stopped before
resubmitting the statement.
SQLSTATE: 55011
-620 KEYWORD keyword IN stmt-type STATEMENT IS NOT PERMITTED FOR A space-type SPACE IN THE database-type DATABASE
Explanation: The specified keyword in the SQL statement stmt-type indicates an attribute that is not allowed for a
space-type space in a database-type database. For example, you cannot set LOGGED or NOT LOGGED when you create
or alter a table space in a WORK FILE database.
keyword Specifies the keyword that is not allowed.

-621 DUPLICATE DBID dbid WAS DETECTED AND PREVIOUSLY ASSIGNED TO database-name
Explanation: The current database being created was assigned a DBID of 'dbid', which is identical to the DBID
assigned to database 'database-name'. An inconsistency exists between the DB2 catalog and directory.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No new object was created, and the existing object was not
altered or modified.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Programmer response: Notify the system programmer. The inconsistency must be corrected before CREATE
DATABASE will be successful.
SQLSTATE: 58001
-622 FOR MIXED DATA IS INVALID BECAUSE THE MIXED DATA INSTALL OPTION IS NO
Explanation: FOR MIXED DATA is specified in a column description of a CREATE or ALTER TABLE, a CREATE
FUNCTION, or a CREATE PROCEDURE statement, but the MIXED DATA installation option is set to NO. FOR
MIXED DATA is valid only when the MIXED DATA installation option is set to YES.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Either change the installation option or the FOR clause. If the installation option is correctly
set to NO, the allowable FOR clause options are BIT and SBCS.
SQLSTATE: 56031
-623 CLUSTER IS NOT VALID FOR table-name
Explanation: A table can have only one cluster index, and hash organization cannot be used when a table has a
clustering index.
table-name
The name of the table.
The CLUSTER option cannot be specified for one of the following reasons:
v A CREATE INDEX statement attempted to create a cluster index on the specified table, but a clustering index
already exists on the table.
v An ALTER INDEX statement specified the CLUSTER clause, but there is already a clustering index defined for the
table.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Check to determine the identity and validity of the existing cluster index on or use of hash
organization with the object table. Alternatively, consider creating the index without the CLUSTER attribute.
SQLSTATE: 55012
-624 TABLE table-name ALREADY HAS A PRIMARY KEY OR UNIQUE CONSTRAINT WITH SPECIFIED COLUMNS AND PERIODS
Explanation: An ALTER TABLE statement cannot be processed for one of the following reasons:
v The table already has a primary key.
v The table has an existing unique constraint with the same definition as the new key. (The existing set of columns
and periods is specified in the ALTER statement.)
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Do not attempt to define a table with more than one primary key, or a unique constraint that
duplicates the definition of an existing unique constraint.
SQLSTATE: 42889
Related reference:
ALTER TABLE (DB2 SQL)
-625 TABLE table-name DOES NOT HAVE AN INDEX TO ENFORCE THE UNIQUENESS OF THE PRIMARY OR UNIQUE KEY
Explanation: The ALTER TABLE statement is invalid for one of the following reasons:
v The table does not have a unique index with a key that is identical to the nominated primary or unique key.
v A unique index exists, but the index is already being used to enforce referential constraints. In this case, DB2 does
not choose the index to enforce the primary or unique key.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Make sure the key list specified on the ALTER TABLE statement identifies an existing
unique index of the table that is not already enforcing referential constraints.
SQLSTATE: 55014
-626 THE ALTER STATEMENT IS NOT EXECUTABLE BECAUSE THE PAGE SET IS NOT STOPPED
Explanation: An ALTER statement specifies an ADD PART, USING, PRIQTY, SECQTY, ERASE, or GBPCACHE
clause, but the page set is not stopped.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Stop the page set and resubmit the statement.
SQLSTATE: 55015
-627 THE ALTER STATEMENT IS INVALID BECAUSE THE TABLE SPACE OR INDEX HAS USER-MANAGED DATA SETS
Explanation: This error is issued for the following reasons:
v a CREATE or ALTER statement specified a PRIQTY, SECQTY, or ERASE clause, USING STOGROUP was not
specified, and the table space or index has user-managed data sets. The primary and secondary space allocation of
a user-managed data set cannot be altered by means of an ALTER statement.
v an ALTER statement attempted to define a clone table for a base table that is in a table space that has
user-managed data sets. A clone table cannot be defined for a base table that is in a table space that has
user-managed data sets.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Verify that the correct table, index, or partition is specified.
SQLSTATE: 55016
-628 THE CLAUSES ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE

Statements (DB2 SQL)
-629 SET NULL CANNOT BE SPECIFIED BECAUSE FOREIGN KEY name CANNOT CONTAIN NULL VALUES
Explanation: The code SET NULL option of the indicated FOREIGN KEY clause is invalid because no column of the
key allows null values. The name is the constraint-name specified in the FOREIGN KEY clause or, if a
constraint-name was not specified, the first column-name specified in the clause.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change a column of the key to allow null values or change the delete rule.
SQLSTATE: 42834
-631 FOREIGN KEY name IS TOO LONG OR HAS TOO MANY COLUMNS
Explanation: This code is used to report that the sum of the length attributes of the columns identified in the
indicated FOREIGN KEY clause is greater than 255 bytes or the number of columns identified is greater than 64. The
'name' is the constraint-name specified in the FOREIGN KEY clause or, if a constraint-name was not specified, the
first column-name specified in the clause.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: The table definition must be modified to conform to the system-imposed limit of the sum of
the length attributes of the columns identified in the PRIMARY KEY clause.
SQLSTATE: 54008
-632 THE TABLE CANNOT BE DEFINED AS A DEPENDENT OF table-name BECAUSE OF DELETE RULE RESTRICTIONS
Explanation: This code is used to report that the object of an ALTER TABLE statement cannot be defined as a
dependent of the indicated table because either:
v The relationship would form a cycle that would cause the table to be delete-connected to itself.
v The relationship would cause the table to be delete-connected to the indicated table through multiple paths and
the delete rule of the existing relationship is SET NULL.
The error is due to the delete rules of existing relationships, not the delete rule specified in the FOREIGN KEY clause
of the ALTER TABLE statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Eliminate the particular FOREIGN KEY clause from the ALTER or CREATE TABLE
statement.
SQLSTATE: 42915
-633 THE DELETE RULE MUST BE delete-rule
Explanation: The code is used to report that the 'delete-rule' specified in a FOREIGN KEY clause of the ALTER
TABLE statement is invalid. The indicated 'delete-rule' is required because:
v A self-referencing constraint must have a 'delete-rule' of CASCADE or NO ACTION.
v The relationship would cause the table to be delete-connected to the same table through multiple paths and such
relationships must have the same 'delete-rule'.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the 'delete rule' in the FOREIGN KEY clause.
SQLSTATE: 42915
-634 THE DELETE RULE MUST NOT BE CASCADE
Explanation: The code is used to report that the CASCADE delete rule specified in the FOREIGN KEY clause of an
ALTER TABLE statement is invalid because:
v The relationship would form a cycle that would cause a table to be delete-connected to itself.
v The relationship would cause another table to be delete-connected to the same table through multiple paths with
different delete rules or with a delete rule equal to SET NULL.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the delete rule.
SQLSTATE: 42915
-635 THE DELETE RULES CANNOT BE DIFFERENT OR CANNOT BE SET NULL
Explanation: The code is used to report that the delete rules specified in two FOREIGN KEY clauses of the CREATE
TABLE statement are invalid because the table would be delete-connected to the same table through multiple paths
involving relationships with different delete rules or with delete rules of SET NULL.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the delete rule.
SQLSTATE: 42915
-636 RANGES SPECIFIED FOR PARTITION part-num ARE NOT VALID
Explanation: The ranges specified for partition part-num are not valid for one of the following reasons:
v The partitioning key values specified in the limit key value specifications were not in either ascending or
descending order.
v All of the columns in the partitioning key are ascending, and a constant or MINVALUE was specified following
MAXVALUE in the limit key value specification for the partition. Once MAXVALUE is specified, all subsequent
columns must be MAXVALUE.
v All of the columns in the partitioning key are descending, and a constant or MAXVALUE was specified following
MINVALUE in the limit key value specification for the partition. Once MINVALUE is specified, all subsequent
columns must be MINVALUE.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Correct the range partitioning specifications in the statement for the identified partition.
SQLSTATE: 56016
-637 DUPLICATE keyword-name KEYWORD OR CLAUSE
Explanation: The SQL statement contains a duplicate specification for the keyword-name key word. For example:
v DEFAULT, UNIQUE, and PRIMARY can only be specified once in a column definition.
v UNIQUE and PRIMARY cannot both be specified for the same column definition.
v PRIMARY can only be specified once in a CREATE TABLE statement.
v The attribute-string specified in the ATTRIBUTES clause of the PREPARE statement cannot specify an option more
than once.
v ACTIVATE or DEACTIVATE ROW ACCESS CONTROL can only be specified once.
v ACTIVATE or DEACTIVATE COLUMN ACCESS CONTROL can only be specified once.
v IN ACCELERATOR can only be specified once.
v ATTRIBUTE ENCRYPTION can only be specified once in a TRUSTED CONTEXT definition.
v There are more than one xquery-context-item-expression in the PASSING clause of an XMLQUERY or XMLEXISTS.
v WHEN MATCHED and WHEN NOT MATCHED clauses cannot be specified more than once in a MERGE
statement.
v SKIP LOCKED DATA clause cannot be specified more than once for:
¨C all clauses in select-stmt
¨C SELECT INTO statements
¨C search UPDATE statements
¨C search DELETE statements
v If multiple ADD COLUMN clauses are specified in the same statement, at most one ADD COLUMN clause can
contain a references-clause.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the statement by removing duplicate clauses.
SQLSTATE: 42614
-638 TABLE table-name CANNOT BE CREATED BECAUSE COLUMN DEFINITION IS MISSING
Explanation: The CREATE TABLE statement does not contain any column definition.
System action: The SQL statement cannot be executed.
Programmer response: Add column definition to the statement.
SQLSTATE: 42601
-639 A NULLABLE COLUMN OF A FOREIGN KEY WITH A DELETE RULE OF SET NULL CANNOT BE A COLUMN OF THE KEY OF A PARTITIONED INDEX
Explanation: A partition key of the clustering index cannot be updated. Therefore, a foreign key column with a
delete rule of SET NULL cannot be a column of a partition key if that column is nullable. If this error occurs for an
ALTER TABLE operation, the foreign key cannot be created. If this error occurs for a CREATE INDEX operation, the
index cannot be created.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Review the delete rule of the referential constraint and the partition keys for the index. Do
one of the following:
v If the operation in error was CREATE INDEX, either change the index partition key definition or drop and redefine
the referential constraint with a different delete rule.
v If the operation in error was ALTER TABLE, change the referential delete rule so that all nullable index keys are
not part of the foreign keys.
SQLSTATE: 56027
-640 LOCKSIZE ROW CANNOT BE SPECIFIED BECAUSE TABLE IN THIS TABLESPACE HAS TYPE 1 INDEX
Explanation: If LOCKSIZE ROW is specified for a table space, all indexes on tables in the table space must be type
2 indexes. The following SQL statement identifies all the type 1 indexes:
SELECT I.CREATOR, I.NAME
FROM SYSIBM.SYSINDEXES I,
SYSIBM.SYSTABLES T
WHERE INDEXTYPE = ¡¯ ¡¯
AND T.TSNAME = ¡¯table_space_name¡¯
AND T.DBNAMe = ¡¯database_name¡¯
AND T.CREATOR = I.TBCREATOR
AND T.NAME = I.TBNAME;
where 'table_space_name' is the name of the table space that is to be altered; 'database_name' is the name of the database
that contains the table space.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Since the LOCKSIZE ROW on the table space and the type 1 indexes conflict, either use the
ALTER INDEX statement to convert all type 1 indexes to type 2 indexes or use another LOCKSIZE option.
SQLSTATE: 56089
-643 A CHECK CONSTRAINT OR THE VALUE OF AN EXPRESSION FOR A COLUMN OF AN INDEX EXCEEDS THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE LENGTH KEY EXPRESSION
Explanation: The definition of a check constraint or expression of an index column exceeds the maximum allowable
length:
v A check constraint exceeded 3800 UTF-8 bytes. Redundant blank spaces are excluded from this limit.
v A value for an expression for an index exceeded 4000 UTF-8 bytes.
System action: The CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement failed. The statement cannot be executed.
Programmer response: Change the constraint or expression so that it does not exceed the maximum allowable limit.
If it is a check constraint, rewrite the check constraint definition so that it is less than 3800 UTF-8 bytes. You might
need to divide a the check constraint into two or more smaller check constraints.
SQLSTATE: 54024
-644 INVALID VALUE SPECIFIED FOR KEYWORD OR CLAUSE keyword-or-clause IN STATEMENT statement-type
Explanation: The value specified for the keyword-or-clause parameter in the statement-type SQL statement is not a
permitted value.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the statement.
SQLSTATE: 42615

-646 TABLE table-name CANNOT BE CREATED IN SPECIFIED TABLE SPACE table-space-name BECAUSE IT ALREADY CONTAINS A TABLE
Explanation: The table space that is specified in a CREATE TABLE statement is one of the following types of table
spaces and already contains an existing table:
v A partitioned table space
v An implicitly defined table space
v A LOB table space
v An XML table space
v A table space that contains a system-period temporal table or history table
Only one table can exist in these types of table spaces.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The table was not created.
Programmer response: Verify that the correct table space was specified in the CREATE statement.

-647 BUFFERPOOL bp-name FOR IMPLICIT OR EXPLICIT TABLESPACE OR INDEXSPACE name HAS NOT BEEN ACTIVATED
Explanation: The buffer pool specified in a CREATE or ALTER statement for a table space or index (index space) is
not activated. Alternatively, on a CREATE TABLE statement without an IN clause, the buffer pool, which is chosen
by DB2 implicitly according to the actual record size, is not activated.
Table spaces and indexes (index spaces) can only be assigned or reassigned to buffer pools that are currently
activated.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The specified table space or index space was not created or
altered.
Programmer response: Verify that the proper buffer pool was specified in the CREATE or ALTER statement and the
buffer pool is chosen by DB2. Use the -DISPLAY BUFFERPOOL command to display the attributes of the buffer pool
and determine if the buffer pool is activated. If the buffer pool is not activated, use the -ALTER BUFFERPOOL
command to change the VPSIZE from 0 to the appropriate size.
SQLSTATE: 57003
-650 THE ALTER STATEMENT CANNOT BE EXECUTED, REASON reason-code
Explanation: The ALTER statement cannot be executed for the indicated reason.
reason-code
A numeric value that indicates the reason that the statement cannot be executed.
5 An ALTER statement with a PIECESIZE clause is not allowed for a partitioning index.
6 An ALTER statement with a PIECESIZE 4G clause is not allowed for non-partitioned indexes on a
non-large table.
7 An ALTER statement with a DSSIZE clause is allowed only for LOB and universal table spaces.
8 An ALTER statement with a SEGSIZE clause is allowed for universal table spaces and partitioned
table spaces that use table-controlled partitioning.
9 An ALTER statement with a BUFFERPOOL clause where a different page size is specified is
allowed only for LOB and universal table spaces (excluding XML table spaces).
10 An ALTER statement with a MAXPARTITIONS clause is allowed only for the following table
spaces:
v Single-table simple table spaces
v Single-table segmented table spaces
v Universal table spaces that use partition-by-growth organization
11 An ALTER statement with an ENDING AT clause is not allowed for an index on a partitioned base
table with LOB columns or the table itself.
12 ALTER INDEX is not allowed when there is a pending SQL statement.
13 ALTER TABLE is not allowed when there is a pending SQL statement.
14 An ALTER INDEX statement with an ENDING AT clause is not allowed when using
table-controlled partitioning.
15 Using ALTER to change the attributes of a partition values is not allowed for an index on a
partitioned base table with LOB columns, or the table itself.
16 ALTER TABLE DATA CAPTURE CHANGES is not allowed for table spaces in advisory
REORG-pending (AREO) state.
17 ALTER TABLE DROP CLONE cannot be used to drop a clone when the table itself is a clone.
18 ALTER INDEX is not allowed when the table has defined a clone.
19 ALTER TABLESPACE is not allowed when the table space contains a table that has a clone defined.
20 ALTER TABLE DROP CLONE cannot be used to drop a clone when the table does not have a
defined clone.
21 ALTER TABLE SET DEFAULT is not allowed when all of the following conditions are true:
v The table exists in a table space that currently has the DEFINE YES attribute.
v The ALTER TABLE statement references a column that was not part of the original table
definition.
v The table has not been reorganized since the referenced column was added.
22 ALTER TABLE SET DEFAULT and DROP DEFAULT are not allowed for tables referenced by a
materialized query table or view.
23 ALTER TABLE DROP DEFAULT is not allowed when the table space is in the advisory
REORG-pending (AREO*) state.
25 ALTER TABLE DROP DEFAULT is not allowed when all of the following conditions are true:
v The table space is in either the advisory REORG-pending (AREO*) or REORG-pending (REORP)
state.
v The ALTER TABLE statement references a column that was not part of the original table
definition.
v The table has not been reorganized since the referenced column was added.
In this case, a mass UPDATE can be used to clear the AREO* state.
28 ALTER TABLE is not allowed when the table is an accelerator-only table.
29 ALTER TABLESPACE is not allowed when the table space contains an accelerator-only table.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the error based on the information provided for the reason-code value, and reissue the
statement.

-651 TABLE DESCRIPTION EXCEEDS MAXIMUM SIZE OF OBJECT DESCRIPTOR.
Explanation: The CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement causes the table descriptor (record OBD) to exceed
the object descriptor size limit of 32KB.
System action: The statement is not executed. For an ALTER TABLE statement, the definition of the table is
unchanged. For a CREATE TABLE statement, the table is not created.
Programmer response: Change the statement by reducing either the number or length (or a combination of both) of
the user-defined default string constants or check constraints and execute the statement again.
SQLSTATE: 54025
-652 VIOLATION OF INSTALLATION DEFINED EDIT OR VALIDATION PROCEDURE proc-name
Explanation: The result of the SQL statement has been rejected by the installation defined edit or validation
procedure 'proc-name' for the object table.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The contents of the object table were not modified.
Programmer response: Determine the requirements imposed by the edit or validation procedure for inserts and
updates of the object table.
SQLSTATE: 23506
-653 TABLE table-name IN PARTITIONED TABLE SPACE tspace-name IS NOT AVAILABLE BECAUSE ITS PARTITIONED INDEX HAS NOT BEEN CREATED
Explanation: An attempt has been made to insert or manipulate data in or create a view on a partitioned table (that
is, a table residing in a partitioned table space) before the partitioned index for that table has been created.
A table residing in a partitioned table space cannot be referenced in any SQL manipulative statement or a CREATE
VIEW statement before the partitioned index for that table has been created.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Verify that the correct table was specified in the statement. If so, ensure that the partitioned
index for the table has been created successfully before attempting to execute any SQL manipulative statements that
reference that table.
SQLSTATE: 57004
-655 THE CREATE OR ALTER STOGROUP IS INVALID BECAUSE THE STORAGE GROUP WOULD HAVE BOTH SPECIFIC AND NON-SPECIFIC VOLUME IDS
Explanation: One of the following error conditions occurred:
v Both a specific and a non-specific ('*') volume ID are specified in the VOLUMES clause of a CREATE STOGROUP
statement.
v Both a specific and a non-specific ('*') volume ID are specified in an ADD VOLUMES clause of an ALTER
STOGROUP statement.
v A specific volume ID is specified in an ADD VOLUMES clause of an ALTER of a storage group that has
non-specific volume IDs or mixed volume IDs.
v A non-specific volume ID ('*') is specified in an ADD VOLUMES clause of an ALTER of a storage group that has
specific volume IDs or mixed volume IDs.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Specify either specific or non-specific volume IDs in the VOLUMES clause of CREATE
STOGROUP statement and the ADD VOLUMES clause of the ALTER STOGROUP statement. To add specific volume
IDs to a storage group with non-specific volume IDs, use the REMOVE VOLUMES clause to remove the non-specific
volume IDs. To add non-specific volume IDs to a storage group with specific volume IDs, use the REMOVE
VOLUMES clause to remove the specific volume IDs.
SQLSTATE: 56036
-658 A object-type CANNOT BE DROPPED USING THE statement STATEMENT
Explanation: A DROP statement was issued, but the object cannot be explicitly dropped. The object must be
dropped by dropping an associated object:
TRIGGER PACKAGE
A trigger package cannot be dropped with the DROP PACKAGE statement. A trigger package can only be
dropped implicitly when the associated trigger is dropped using the DROP TRIGGER statement.
CAST FUNCTION
A cast function cannot be explicitly dropped with the DROP FUNCTION statement. A cast function can only
be dropped implicitly when the associated distinct type is dropped using the DROP DISTINCT TYPE
statement.
ROW PERMISSION
A default row permission cannot be explicitly dropped with the DROP PERMISSION statement. A default
row permission can only be dropped implicitly when the associated table is dropped using the DROP
TABLE statement. Alternatively, the default row permission can be dropped by using the ALTER TABLE
statement with the DEACTIVATE ROW ACCESS clause.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Issue the appropriate DROP statement to drop the intended objects.
SQLSTATE: 42917
-660 INDEX index-name CANNOT BE CREATED OR ALTERED ON PARTITIONED TABLE SPACE tspace-name BECAUSE KEY LIMITS ARE NOT SPECIFIED
Explanation: The CREATE INDEX or ALTER INDEX statement did not specify limit key values for the partitions of
the table space. To create a clustering index for a table in a partitioned table space, or to modify those values using
ALTER INDEX, you must include those values.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The specified cluster index was not created or altered.
Programmer response: Verify that the correct table was specified in the CREATE INDEX or ALTER INDEX
statement. If so, the definition for the partitioned table space must be examined so that a proper definition for the
cluster index for the table may be constructed.

-661 object-type object-name CANNOT BE CREATED ON PARTITIONED TABLE SPACE tspace-name BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF PARTITION SPECIFICATIONS IS NOT EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF PARTITIONS OF THE TABLE SPACE
Explanation: The object-name definition is incorrect for one of the following reasons:
v If object-type is INDEX, the CREATE INDEX statement for the cluster index on a partitioned table (that is, a table
residing in a partitioned table space) does not contain the same number of partition specifications as there are
partitions in the table space. The definition for the cluster index for a partitioned table must contain exactly as
many partition specifications as there are partitions in the table space in which that table resides. Also, the
partition numbers must be valid and unique.
v If object-type is TABLE, the number of partitions that is specified in the partitioning clause of the CREATE TABLE
statement differs from the number of partitions in the table space in which the table is being created.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The specified cluster index or table was not created.
Programmer response: Examine the definition of the partitioned table space to determine how many partitions have
been specified. Correct the syntax of the CREATE INDEX or CREATE TABLE statement to provide the proper
number of partition specifications.

01 The CREATE INDEX statement contains the PARTITION BY clause for index-controlled partitioning, but the
table on which the index is created has one of the following characteristics:
v The table is not in a partitioned table space.
v The table is in a partition-by-growth or a range-partitioned universal table space.
02 The CREATE INDEX statement contains the PARTITIONED option, but the table on which the index is
created has one of the following characteristics:
v The table is not in a partitioned table space.
v The table is in a partition-by-growth table space.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The specified index was not created.
Programmer response: Verify that the proper object table was specified in the statement. Review the proper usage of
the PARTITION BY clause or the PARTITIONED option in CREATE INDEX statements

-663 THE NUMBER OF KEY LIMIT VALUES IS EITHER ZERO, OR GREATER THAN THE NUMBER OF COLUMNS IN THE KEY OF INDEX index-name
Explanation: The number of limit key value specifications provided in at least one of the PART specifications of the
CREATE INDEX or ALTER INDEX statement is either zero or greater than the number of columns in the index key.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The specified index was not created.
Programmer response: Correct the statement so that each PART specification contains exactly the same number of
limit key value specifications as there are columns in the index key.
SQLSTATE: 53038
-665 THE PARTITION CLAUSE OF AN ALTER STATEMENT IS OMITTED OR INVALID
Explanation: The ALTER statement is invalid for one of the following reasons:
v The table space or index is not partitioned and the PARTITION clause is specified.
v The table space is a partition-by-growth table space and the PARTITION clause is specified.
v The table space or index is partitioned, a partition attribute (FREEPAGE or PCTFREE) is specified, and the
PARTITION clause is not specified.
v The integer specified in the PARTITION clause does not identify a partition of the table space or index.
v A USING, PRIQTY, SECQTY, or ERASE clause is used to alter storage attributes, but the partition is not specified.
v A GBPCACHE clause is used to alter the group buffer pool caching attributes, but the partition is not specified.
v The PARTITION BY clause is specified without a PARTITION clause to specify the range for the partition. You
must specify a PARTITION clause with a range to alter the PARTITION BY specification.
v Using ALTER to change the attributes of a partition values is not allowed for an index on a partitioned base table
with LOB columns, or the table itself.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Determine whether the table space or index you want to alter is partitioned. If it is
partitioned, specify a PARTITION clause that identifies the partition you want to alter. If it is not partitioned, do not
specify the PARTITION clause.
SQLSTATE: 53039
-666 stmt-verb object CANNOT BE EXECUTED BECAUSE function IS IN PROGRESS
Explanation: The SQL statement could not be executed because the named function was executing at the time.
stmt-verb
The type of data definition language (DDL) statement
object The DB2 object type
function The active function that prevented the action. A utility, the resource limit facility, or the distributed data
facility (DDF)
If the object is part of the communications database, it cannot be dropped while the DDF is active.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If the function is a utility, wait for the function to complete or stop. Then resubmit the
statement for execution.
If the function is the resource limit facility, the statement cannot be executed until the resource limit facility is
stopped or switched to a different resource limit table. In a DB2 data sharing environment, the resource limit facility
must be stopped on all members of the DB2 data sharing group or all members must switch to a resource limit table
that is not associated with the object.
If the function is the DDF, the facility must be stopped before the object can be dropped. In a DB2 data sharing
environment, the facility must be stopped on all members of the DB2 data sharing group.

-667 THE CLUSTERING INDEX FOR A PARTITIONED TABLE SPACE CANNOT BE EXPLICITLY DROPPED
Explanation: The DROP INDEX statement attempted to drop the cluster index for a table residing in a partitioned
table space. The cluster index for such a table cannot be dropped explicitly with the DROP INDEX statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The specified index was not dropped.
Programmer response: The cluster index for a table in a partitioned table space can only be dropped implicitly
when the associated partitioned table space is dropped.
SQLSTATE: 42917
-668 THE COLUMN CANNOT BE ADDED TO THE TABLE BECAUSE THE TABLE HAS AN EDIT PROCEDURE DEFINED WITH ROW ATTRIBUTE SENSITIVITY
Explanation: The ALTER TABLE statement attempted to add a column to a table that has an edit procedure that is
defined with row attribute sensitivity. No columns can be added to this table.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The specified table was not altered.
Programmer response: Verify that the correct table was specified in the ALTER statement. Do not attempt to alter
the definition of a table that has an installation-written edit procedure associated with it.
SQLSTATE: 56018

ALTER TABLE (DB2 SQL)
-669 THE OBJECT CANNOT BE EXPLICITLY DROPPED. REASON reason-code
Explanation: The DROP statement failed.
reason-code
A numeric value that indicates the reason for the failure.
 0001 One of the following statements attempted to drop a table that resides in an explicitly defined
partitioned table space or a partition-by-growth table space:
v The DROP TABLE statement
v A DROP statement which causes a dependent table to be dropped
 0002 The DROP INDEX statement attempted to drop an index that DB2 requires to retain the following
conditions:
v The primary key constraint on a table
v A unique key constraint on a table
v A referential constraint on a table
v The uniqueness of a ROWID column
v An XML column defined on a table
A system required index cannot be dropped using the DROP INDEX statement.
 0003 The DROP INDEX statement attempted to drop an implicitly created index for a table that is
defined with HASH organization.
 0004 The DROP TABLE statement attempted to drop a table that was implicitly created for an XML
column.
 0005 The DROP TABLESPACE statement attempted to drop a table space that was implicitly created for
a table containing an XML column.
 0006 The DROP statement attempted to drop an auxiliary table, an auxiliary index, or an auxiliary table
space that is involved in cloning.
 0007 The DROP TABLESPACE statement or DROP DATABASE statement attempted to drop a table
space or database that contains an accelerator-only table.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The object is not dropped.
Programmer response: Take the appropriate corrective action based on the reason-code value:
 0001 The table of a partitioned table space can be dropped implicitly only when the table space itself is dropped.
 0002 If you do not want to keep the primary key, unique key, or referential constraint, use the DROP
CONSTRAINT clause of the ALTER TABLE statement to remove the primary key or unique constraint. If the
index was created only for enforcing the primary or unique key, the index will be dropped. If not, the DROP
INDEX statement could then be processed. An index for a ROWID column can only be dropped by
dropping the table.
 0003 The index can only be dropped implicitly when the associated table that contains the XML column is
dropped. If the error is about a table that is organized by hash, then the associated hash overflow index
cannot be dropped. Dropping hash organization will automatically drop the hash overflow index.
 0004 The table can be dropped implicitly only when the associated table containing the XML column is dropped.
 0005 The table space can be dropped implicitly only when the associated table containing the XML column is
dropped.
 0006 An auxiliary table, an auxiliary index, or an auxiliary table space that is involved in cloning can be dropped
implicitly only when the associated table containing the XML column is dropped.
 0007 The table space or database can be dropped explicitly only when the accelerator-only table is dropped.
SQLSTATE: 42917
-670 THE RECORD LENGTH OF THE TABLE EXCEEDS THE PAGE SIZE LIMIT
Explanation: The row length for a table cannot exceed the page size of the table space in which that table resides (or
is to reside). The page size of the table space is determined by the buffer pool used by that table space. This error can
result from one of the following conditions:
Table creation
The following conditions are possible for a CREATE TABLE statement:
v As defined in a CREATE TABLE statement, the row length for the table would exceed the page size of the
specified (or default) table space. To correct this situation, either:
¨C Reduce the row length of the table by reducing the length of one or more of the columns.
¨C Assign the table to a table space that uses a larger buffer pool.
v The LOB column with INLINE LENGTH clause has contributed to exceeding the page size limit.
Table alteration
The following conditions are possible for an ALTER TABLE statement:
v Addition of the specified column would cause the row length of the table to exceed the page size of the
table space. This table cannot be altered to add columns.
v The statement was issued to alter the length of an existing variable-length column and the new length of
the altered column would cause the row length of the table to exceed the page size of the table space.
v The LOB column with an INLINE LENGTH clause has contributed to exceeding the page size limit.
To correct this situation, reduce the length of the column.
Table space alteration
In the case of an ALTER TABLESPACE statement that is used to alter the buffer pool to a smaller page size,
the row length for one of the tables in the table space exceeds the new smaller page size.
Join result
The row length in the result of a join exceeds the maximum limit. The limit is 65,529 bytes in new-function
mode or approximately the maximum page size in conversion mode. The sort record includes columns that
are being sorted and columns that the user selects. The length of the columns that the user selects is the sort
data length.
Sort result
The following conditions are possible for a sort result:
v The row length of a large sort record exceeds the maximum limit. The limit is 65,529 bytes in
new-function mode or approximately the maximum page size in conversion mode. The sort record
includes columns that are being sorted and columns that the user selects. The length of the columns that
the user selects is the sort data length.
v The sort key length for a sort exceeds the maximum limit. The limit is 32,000 bytes in new-function mode
or 16,000 bytes in conversion mode. The length of the columns that are being sorted is the sort key length.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the error based on the information provided, and reissue the statement.

-671 THE BUFFERPOOL ATTRIBUTE OF THE TABLE SPACE CANNOT BE ALTERED AS SPECIFIED BECAUSE IT WOULD CHANGE THE PAGE SIZE OF THE TABLE SPACE
Explanation: For example, the change to the buffer pool attribute for the table space specified in the ALTER
TABLESPACE statement would change the page size of the table space¡ªeither from 4KB to 32KB, 8KB to 16KB, or
vice versa.
Use of the ALTER TABLESPACE statement to change the page size of a table space is not permitted.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The table space definition was not altered.
Programmer response: For example, if the table space uses one of the 4KB buffer pools (for example, BP0, BP1, or
BP2), it can be reassigned to one of the other 4KB buffer pools (but not buffer pool BP32K). If, however, it is assigned
to buffer pool BP32K, the buffer pool assignment cannot be subsequently altered.
SQLSTATE: 53040
-672 OPERATION DROP NOT ALLOWED ON TABLE table_name
Explanation: The DROP operation failed for one of the following reasons:
v The table being dropped has the RESTRICT ON DROP attribute.
v The table space or database being dropped contains the specified table, which has the RESTRICT ON DROP
attribute.
System action: The DROP statement cannot be executed.
Programmer response: Before dropping the table, alter the table, specifying DROP RESTRICT ON DROP.
For DROP TABLESPACE or DROP DATABASE, make sure that there are no other tables within the table space or
database with the RESTRICT ON DROP attribute. The following SELECT statement can identify the tables:
SELECT CREATOR, NAME
FROM SYSIBM.SYSTABLES
WHERE TYPE = ¡¯T¡¯
AND CLUSTERTYPE = ¡¯Y¡¯
AND DBNAME = ¡¯database_name¡¯
AND TSNAME = ¡¯tablespace_name¡¯;
SQLSTATE: 55035
-676 THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INDEX ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIED STATEMENT. THE STATEMENT HAS FAILED. REASON reason-code
Explanation: A reason code is issued during the processing of a CREATE INDEX or ALTER INDEX statement.
When the statement fails, the reason for the failure is indicated by the following reason code value:
 0001 You specified a buffer pool with a page size other then 4KB in the CREATE or ALTER INDEX statement.
 0002 An ALTER INDEX or CREATE INDEX statement results in an invalid combination of a 4KB page size and
COMPRESS YES. This reason-code will be issued for the following reasons:
v If you tried to CREATE or ALTER an index, you did not specify a buffer pool having a page size that is
supported for index compression. You can only choose a buffer pool with an 8KB, 16KB, or 32KB page
size for a compressed index.
v If you tried to ALTER an index using ALTER INDEX with the COMPRESS YES clause, then the existing
index is not defined with a buffer pool that has an 8KB, 16KB, or 32KB page size, and therefore, the index
cannot be compressed.
 0003 The ALTER INDEX statement has resulted in an index that's on-disk page size in incompatible with the CISIZE of the index's underlying non-DB2 managed data set. This reason-code will be issued for the following reasons:
v If the index is not compressed, a 4 KB page size must reside in a data set that has a 4 KB CISIZE. A page
size greater than 4KB must have a CISIZE that is either 4KB or equal to the page size.
v If the index is compressed, then the index pages on disk are always 4 KB. The CISIZE for the data set
must also be 4KB.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Depending on the reason code value, take the following action:
 0001 Change the buffer pool specification to the name of a buffer pool with a 4KB page size.
 0002 Modify the statement so that is does not result in a compressed index with a 4 KB page size.
 0003 ALTER the STOGROUP to use a DB2 managed data set or change the CISIZE of the user-managed data set to be compatible with the specified index options. If the index is compressed, the CISIZE must be 4KB.
Otherwise, the CISIZE should match the page size or be 4KB.

-677 INSUFFICIENT VIRTUAL STORAGE FOR BUFFERPOOL EXPANSION
Explanation: An attempt to either open (create) or expand a buffer pool has failed because insufficient virtual
storage was available.
This error may occur under either of two circumstances:
v An attempt to create a buffer pool while opening a table space or index(space), or
v An attempt to expand a buffer pool from its current size to its maximum size.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If this error should occur during interactive execution of an SQL statement or execution of
an application program, installation administration should be notified.
Installation Action: It may be necessary to reexamine the buffer pool storage strategy.
One of the following messages has also been sent to the MVS console: DSNB601I, DSNB603I, or DSNB605I.

-678 THE CONSTANT constant SPECIFIED FOR THE INDEX LIMIT KEY MUST CONFORM TO THE DATA TYPE data-type OF THE CORRESPONDING COLUMN column-name
Explanation: The index limit key value constant has been specified incorrectly in the CREATE INDEX or ALTER
INDEX statement.
Limit key value specifications must conform to the data type of the corresponding index key column. In this case,
constant must be of data type data-type to conform to the data type of column column-name.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The index was not created.
Programmer response: Correct the statement so that each limit key value constant is of precisely the same data type
as that of the corresponding index key column.
SQLSTATE: 53045
-679 THE OBJECT name CANNOT BE CREATED BECAUSE A DROP IS PENDING ON THE OBJECT
Explanation: The application program has executed a DROP for the specified object, and then tried to re-create an
object with the same name (and of the same type) before the DROP was completed.
If the object is an index, this error is returned if the index that is to be created uses the same index space name as the
index that was dropped without a commit.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The specified object was not created.
Programmer response: The logic of the application program must be modified to issue a COMMIT (or the IMS or
CICS equivalent) between the DROP and CREATE statements.
SQLSTATE: 57006
-680 TOO MANY COLUMNS SPECIFIED FOR A TABLE, VIEW OR TABLE FUNCTION
Explanation: The maximum number of columns permitted per table, view, or table function is 750. The statement
attempted to perform one of the following actions:
v CREATE or ALTER a table to contain more than 750 columns
v CREATE a view with more than 750 columns
v CREATE a table function with more than 750 columns in the RETURNS TABLE clause
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the CREATE statement to not include more than 750 columns, or do not try to alter
an existing table to contain more than 750 columns.
SQLSTATE: 54011
-681 COLUMN column-name IN VIOLATION OF INSTALLATION DEFINED FIELD PROCEDURE. RT: return-code, RS: reason-code, MSG: message-token
Explanation: An installation field procedure returned an error for 'column-name'. The 'reason-code' and
'message-token' are defined by the field procedure. They may give additional information to help determine the
cause of the problem.

8 Invalid parameter value
12 Field procedure error on any function
Use 'reason-code' and 'message-token' for additional information.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If it is not a field procedure error, determine the requirements imposed by the field
procedure. If it is a field procedure error, examine the field procedure.
SQLSTATE: 23507
-682 FIELD PROCEDURE procedure-name COULD NOT BE LOADED
Explanation: The field procedure 'procedure-name' cannot be loaded.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: The application should either commit or roll back to previous COMMIT. Then, in general,
the application should terminate.
SQLSTATE: 57010
-683 THE SPECIFICATION FOR COLUMN, DISTINCT TYPE, FUNCTION, OR PROCEDURE data-item CONTAINS INCOMPATIBLE CLAUSES
Explanation: The data item specification of a CREATE or ALTER statement contains an error.
data-item
The source of the problem, which varies by statement.
CREATE DISTINCT TYPE statements
The name of the type that is being defined.
CREATE FUNCTION or ALTER FUNCTION statements
The area of the statement that caused the error, such as ¡°PARAMETER 3¡±, ¡°RETURNS¡± or ¡°CAST
FROM¡±.
CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statements
The name of the column that caused the error. The error could be an invalid specification of FOR
BIT DATA, FOR SBCS DATA, FOR MIXED DATA, or FIELDPROC for the column definition.
The following additional restrictions apply to CREATE TABLE statements, ALTER TABLE
statements, or both:
v On an ALTER TABLE statement, generation-alteration cannot be specified for a column that is not
defined as an identity column.
v The columns for a BUSINESS_TIME period must be defined with a data type of DATE or
TIMESTAMP(6) WITHOUT TIME ZONE.
v The data type for a column that is defined as ROW BEGIN, ROW END, or TRANSACTION
START ID must be TIMESTAMP(12) WITHOUT TIME ZONE.
General causes
FIELDPROC can only be specified for columns that are a built-in character string or graphic string
data type that is not a LOB.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the SQL statement by removing the incompatible specification.

SQLSTATE: 58002
-689 TOO MANY COLUMNS DEFINED FOR A DEPENDENT TABLE
Explanation: The maximum number of columns allowed for a dependent table is 749. The code is used to report
that the statement is invalid because of one of the following:
v A CREATE TABLE statement is creating a dependent table with 750 columns.
v An ALTER TABLE statement is altering a dependent table with 749 columns to add a column, or altering a table
with 750 columns to become a dependent table.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the SQL statement to conform to the column limit for a dependent table.

-690 THE STATEMENT IS REJECTED BY DATA DEFINITION CONTROL SUPPORT. REASON reason-code
Explanation: The code is issued by the data definition control support to report that the statement is rejected for the
reason indicated by 'reason-code' after consulting the application registration table and object registration table.
The explanation of the given reason code:
v 0001
Data definition control support is running under the controlling by application name mode. The statement is
rejected because the current application is not registered in application registration table with DEFAULTAPPL on.
v 0002
Data definition control support is running under the controlling by application name with exceptions mode. The
statement is rejected because the object is not registered in object registration table and the current application is
not registered in application registration table with DEFAULTAPPL on.
v 0003
Data definition control support is running under the controlling by application name with exceptions mode. The
statement is rejected because the object is registered in object registration table but the current application does not
match.
v 0004
Data definition control support is running under the controlling by object name with exceptions mode. The
statement is rejected because the object is registered in object registration table but the current application does not
match.
v 0005
Data definition control support is running under the controlling by object name mode. The statement is rejected
because the object is registered in object registration table but the current application does not match.
v 0006
Data definition control support is running under the controlling by object name mode. The statement is rejected
because the object is not registered in object registration table.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Check whether data definition control support is running in the correct mode. Check one or
both registration tables to determine if the entries of the registration tables are correct. If they are not, update the
registration tables.
SQLSTATE: 23508
-691 THE REQUIRED REGISTRATION TABLE table-name DOES NOT EXIST
Explanation: The data definition control support assumes the existence of the application registration table and
object registration table. But either one or both tables is not defined.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Determine whether the required registration tables do exist. If not, create the required tables.
SQLSTATE: 57018
-692 THE REQUIRED UNIQUE INDEX index-name FOR DDL REGISTRATION TABLE table-name DOES NOT EXIST
Explanation: A unique index must be defined for each registration table. The code is issued when either the
required index does not exist or the index defined is not a unique index.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Determine whether the required unique index does exist. If not, create the required index. If
the index does exist, but is not unique, drop it and re-create it as a unique index.
SQLSTATE: 57018
-693 THE COLUMN column-name IN DDL REGISTRATION TABLE OR INDEX name IS NOT DEFINED PROPERLY
Explanation: An error occurred during verification of the application or object registration table.
The table is improperly defined for the following reasons:
v A required column is missing.
v A column description is invalid because its name, column number, data type, length, or null attribute is incorrect.
or
The index is improperly defined for the following reasons:
v A required key column is missing.
v A key column description is invalid because of its key sequence or because its ordering is incorrect.
v A defined key column should not be part of the unique key.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct or alter the definition of the required registration table or index.
SQLSTATE: 55003
-694 THE SCHEMA STATEMENT CANNOT BE EXECUTED BECAUSE A DROP IS PENDING ON THE DDL REGISTRATION TABLE table-name
Explanation: An error occurred while accessing the application registration table or object registration table. The
application registration table or object registration table was dropped, but the DROP statement was not committed.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Resubmit the job. If the same error happens, check for the application that issued the DROP
statement for the application registration table or the object registration table. Either commit the DROP statement
which dropped the table and create a new application registration table or object registration table, or issue a
ROLLBACK for the DROP statement to put the tables back.
SQLSTATE: 57023
-695 INVALID VALUE seclabel SPECIFIED FOR SECURITY LABEL COLUMN OF TABLE table-name
Explanation: For an insert or an update operation to table table-name, the value that was specified for the security

-717 bind-type FOR object-type object-name WITH MARK release-dependency-mark FAILED BECAUSE object-type DEPENDS ON FUNCTIONS OF THE RELEASE FROM WHICH FALLBACK HAS OCCURRED
Explanation: The plan or package indicated depends on a function of DB2 which is not supported by the currently
active release.
bind-type
REBIND
object-type
PLAN | PACKAGE
object-name
Name of the application plan, or the package
release-dependency-mark
A one-character mark showing the oldest release of DB2 can support this plan or package. The release
dependency mark for the plan is kept in the IBMREQD columns in the DB2 catalog in SYSIBM.SYSPLAN
(plans), SYSIBM.SYSPACKAGE(packages).
System action: The REBIND operation for this plan or package is not performed.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Warn users not to use the plan or package until the DB2 subsystem has been
remigrated to the newer release.
User response: The plan or package cannot be used until the DB2 subsystem is remigrated to the newer release.
SQLSTATE: 56066
-718 REBIND OF PACKAGE package-name FAILED BECAUSE IBMREQD OF ibmreqd IS INVALID
Explanation: The IBMREQD column of the SYSIBM.SYSPACKAGE catalog table for the named package contains an
unrecognizable character.
package-name
Name of the package (location.collection.package.version)
System action: The REBIND failed.
User response: You must do a BIND ACTION(REPLACE) for this package.
SQLSTATE: 56067
-719 BIND ADD ERROR USING auth-id AUTHORITY PACKAGE package-name ALREADY EXISTS
Explanation: An attempt is made to add a package that already exists. The combination of
'location.collection.package.version' must be unique in the SYSIBM.SYSPACKAGE table. In addition, the combination
of 'location.collection.package.consistency-token' must be unique.
auth-id Authorization ID of the invoker of the BIND subcommand.
package-name
Name of the package (location.collection.package.version).
System action: No package is created.
System programmer response: Check the SYSIBM.SYSPACKAGE catalog table for names of existing application
packages. Call the BIND subcommand again, with a 'location.collection.package.version' that is not in use.
SQLSTATE: 42710
-720 BIND ERROR, ATTEMPTING TO REPLACE PACKAGE = package_name WITH version= version2 BUT THIS VERSION ALREADY EXISTS
Explanation: An attempt is made to create a version of a package that already exists. The version specified in the
REPLVER keyword is different from the version specified for the precompile. The version specified for the
precompile already exists in the catalog. The combination of 'location.collection.package.version' must be unique in
the SYSIBM.SYSPACKAGE catalog table. A common mistake is that the user may believe that the version he is
creating is the one specified in the REPLVER keyword. This is not the case. The version specified in the REPLVER
keyword is the name of the version being replaced. The version that will be created is the version that was given to
the program when it was precompiled.
package_name
Fully qualified package name
version2
Version-id of package that is to be created
System action: The bind will fail.
System programmer response: There are two approaches to solve this problem. The first is to precompile the
program again with a new version name and reissue the original BIND subcommand. The other approach is not to
do the precompile but reissue the BIND subcommand with REPLVER(SAME).
SQLSTATE: 42710
-721 BIND ERROR FOR PACKAGE = pkg-id CONTOKEN = contoken'X IS NOT UNIQUE SO IT CANNOT BE CREATED
Explanation: An attempt is made to add or replace a package with a consistency token that is not unique for that
package. In other words, the combination of location.collection.package.consistency-token already exists.
pkg-id Fully qualified name of the package.
contoken
Consistency token in hexadecimal.
System action: The BIND will fail.
System programmer response: Check the SYSIBM.SYSPACKAGE catalog table for names of existing application
packages with the indicated consistency token. Reissue the BIND subcommand such that the
location.collection.package.consistency-token is unique within the catalog. The following SQL statement can be used to
query the catalog:
SELECT COLLID,NAME
FROM loc-id.SYSIBM.SYSPACKAGE
WHERE HEX(CONTOKEN) = contoken
SQLSTATE: 42710
-722 bind-type ERROR USING auth-id AUTHORITY PACKAGE package-name DOES NOT EXIST
Explanation: The indicated subcommand was issued against a package that does not exist. The individual variable
fields contain:
bind-type
Type of bind subcommand (BIND | REBIND | FREE).
auth-id Authorization ID of the invoker of the BIND subcommand.
package-name
Name of the package (location.collection.package.version)
System action: Package not rebound or freed.
System programmer response: Check the SYSPACKAGE catalog table for the correct
'location.collection.package.version' to use.
SQLSTATE: 42704
-723 AN ERROR OCCURRED IN A TRIGGERED SQL STATEMENT IN trigger-name. INFORMATION RETURNED: SQLCODE: sql-code, SQLSTATE: sql-state, MESSAGE TOKENS token-list, SECTION NUMBER section-number
Explanation: During execution of an UPDATE, MERGE, INSERT, or DELETE statement, a trigger was activated. One
of the triggered SQL statements received an SQL error condition.
trigger-name
The trigger that was activated when the error occurred.
section-number
The section number that is associated with the failing triggered SQL statement. For triggers that contain a
WHEN clause, the WHEN clause is section number one. The triggered SQL statements are numbered
sequentially, beginning with section number two. This is true for triggers with or without a WHEN clause.
sql-code A numeric value that indicates why the SQL statement execution was unsuccessful. This code is received by
the activated trigger.
sql-state The corresponding SQLSTATE for the SQLCODE.
token-list
The list of tokens from the original SQL error. This list might be truncated.
System action: The trigger and the original statement cannot be processed. The triggering table is unchanged.
System programmer response: Identify the failing SQL statement by using one of the following methods:
v Use the trigger name and section number.
v If the trigger definition is available, use the section number.
v Use the following SELECT statement to retrieve the statement from the SYSIBM.SYSPACKSTMT catalog table:
SELECT STMT, SEQNO FROM SYSIBM.SYSPACKSTMT
WHERE COLLID = ¡¯schema-name¡¯ AND
NAME = ¡¯trigger-name¡¯ AND
SECTNOI = section-number
ORDER BY SEQNO
For triggers that were created in DB2 Version 8 new-function mode or later, the STMT result will be in Unicode. To
view a Unicode result as EBCDIC, issue the DISPLAY UTF8 command in the ISPF browse program within SPUFI.
Refer to the explanation of the SQLCODE that is indicated by sql-code in this code and take the appropriate action or
actions.
Programmer response: Contact your database administrator to determine why the trigger named in the message
received the error.
SQLSTATE: 09000
-724 THE ACTIVATION OF THE object-type OBJECT object-name WOULD EXCEED THE MAXIMUM LEVEL OF INDIRECT SQL CASCADING
Explanation: Cascading of indirect SQL occurs when a trigger, user-defined function or stored procedure invokes
another trigger, user-defined function or stored procedure which in turn invokes another. The activation of some of
the triggers in this chain might be due to the enforcement of referential constraint delete rules. The depth of this
cascading is limited to 16.
Note that recursive situations where a trigger includes a triggered SQL statement that directly or indirectly causes the
same trigger to be activated are very likely to cause this error. The trigger should contain logic to check for a
terminating condition to prevent this error.
object-type
Names the type of object being called. Object type is TRIGGER, FUNCTION, or PROCEDURE.
object-name
Specifies the name of the trigger, user-defined function or stored procedure that would have be activated at
the seventeenth level of cascading.
System action: The original statement could not be executed. All SQL statements executed by all triggers,
user-defined functions, and stored procedures in the cascade chain are rolled back. External actions performed by the
indirect SQL, such as sending a network message might have already occurred.
Programmer response: Start with the indirect SQL that is activated by the original SQL operation. Check for
recursive patterns in any invoked user-defined functions or in any triggers defined on the subject of an update
operation. If the chain is not recursive, the cascade chain must be simplified by altering the triggers, user-defined
functions, or stored procedures involved.
SQLSTATE: 54038
-725 THE SPECIAL REGISTER register AT LOCATION location WAS SUPPLIED AN INVALID VALUE
Explanation: DB2 received a SET statement with an invalid value. Valid SETs might be allowed or retained. Further
processing stops at the named site until the SET statement is corrected.
System action: All SQL statements at the named remote site are rejected until the SET statement that was in error is
corrected.
Programmer response: The SET statement should be reissued with a valid value. This situation can be corrected
with a local SET statement or with a DRDA SET statement executed at the remote site. Once the special register has
been supplied a valid value, the application can resume execution.
SQLSTATE: 42721
-726 BIND ERROR ATTEMPTING TO REPLACE PACKAGE = package-name. THERE ARE ENABLE OR DISABLE ENTRIES CURRENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PACKAGE
Explanation: The BIND subcommand was issued to replace a package that has ENABLE or DISABLE entries
currently associated with the package.
System action: Package not bound.
System programmer response: FREE the package first and then BIND the package.
SQLSTATE: 55030
-729 A STORED PROCEDURE SPECIFYING COMMIT ON RETURN CANNOT BE THE TARGET OF A NESTED CALL STATEMENT
Explanation: A stored procedure defined with the COMMIT ON RETURN attribute was called from a stored
procedure, user-defined function, or trigger. Stored procedures defined with COMMIT ON RETURN cannot be
nested in this way.
System action: The SQL statement is not executed. If the CALL statement references a remote server, the unit of
work is placed in a must rollback state.
Programmer response: Remove the CALL to the stored procedure that was defined with the COMMIT ON
RETURN attribute.
SQLSTATE: 429B1
-730 THE PARENT OF A TABLE IN A READ-ONLY SHARED DATABASE MUST ALSO BE A TABLE IN A READ-ONLY SHARED DATABASE
Explanation: An attempt was made to define a relationship between a table in a read-only shared database and a
table that is not.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Ensure that the correct tables are being used for the relationship being defined.
SQLSTATE: 56053
-731 USER-DEFINED DATASET dsname MUST BE DEFINED WITH SHAREOPTIONS(1,3)
Explanation: The VSAM SHAREOPTIONS must be (1,3) for all of the indexes and table spaces in the database. The
user-defined data set identified did not meet this requirement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Ensure that the data sets used in the shared database are defined with the proper
SHAREOPTIONS.
SQLSTATE: 56054
-732 THE DATABASE IS DEFINED ON THIS SUBSYSTEM WITH THE ROSHARE READ ATTRIBUTE BUT THE TABLE SPACE OR INDEX SPACE HAS NOT BEEN DEFINED ON THE OWNING SUBSYSTEM
Explanation: Prior to creating a table space or index in a database with the ROSHARE READ attribute, that object
must first be defined on the owning subsystem.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Verify that the table space or index has been defined on the owning system in a ROSHARE
OWNER database.
SQLSTATE: 56055
-733 THE DESCRIPTION OF A TABLE SPACE, INDEX SPACE, OR TABLE IN A ROSHARE READ DATABASE MUST BE CONSISTENT WITH ITS DESCRIPTION IN THE OWNER SYSTEM
Explanation: This code is issued while creating a table space, index, or table in the ROSHARE READ database.
These objects must be consistent with their descriptions in the ROSHARE OWNER database as follows:
v For a table space, the following attributes must be the same:
¨C Page size
¨C Segment size
¨C Number of partitions
v For an index, the following attributes must be the same:
¨C Number of partitions
¨C Number of subpages
¨C Table OBID
¨C Total key length
¨C Index type (Type 1 or Type 2 Index)
¨C Number of key columns
v For a table, the following attributes must be the same:
¨C Table OBID
¨C Maximum record length
¨C Number of columns
¨C Whether an edit procedure exists
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Ensure that the definition of the table space, index, or table is consistent with that in the
ROSHARE OWNER database.
SQLSTATE: 56056
-734 THE ROSHARE ATTRIBUTE OF A DATABASE CANNOT BE ALTERED FROM ROSHARE READ
Explanation: An attempt was made to ALTER a database from ROSHARE READ to either ROSHARE OWNER or
ROSHARE NONE.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Verify that the correct database was specified on the ALTER DATABASE statement. The
ROSHARE attribute of a read-only shared database cannot be altered. To change this, DROP and re-create the
database.
SQLSTATE: 56057
-735 DATABASE dbid CANNOT BE ACCESSED BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER A SHARED DATABASE
Explanation: An attempt was made to access an object in the database identified by dbid, that is known to the
system as having the ROSHARE READ attribute. The database, however, is no longer defined as ROSHARE OWNER
on the owning subsystem.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Verify that the correct object is specified on the statement.
SQLSTATE: 55004
-736 INVALID OBID obid SPECIFIED
Explanation: An invalid OBID value was given on the CREATE statement. The OBID is invalid for one of the
following reasons:
v The specified OBID does not fall within the acceptable range for OBIDs, which is 2 to 32767.
v The specified OBID is already in use for the given database.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Verify that the given OBID is a valid value for an OBID. If so, ensure that the OBID is
correct for the object to be created, then query the catalog to find the object that is already defined as having the
same OBID in the database. If an invalid OBID was given for the object to be created, correct the statement and
execute it again. If the existing object is in error, then DROP and CREATE that object using the correct OBID value.
It is possible that the OBID ¡°in use¡± is the OBID for an object that had been previously dropped. If that is the case,
and the CREATE was issued for a table in a non-ROSHARE READ database, then select a different OBID for use in
the OBID clause. If the object had been previously dropped and the CREATE was issued for a table in a ROSHARE
READ database, COMMIT and re-submit the CREATE TABLE request.
SQLSTATE: 53014

-737 IMPLICIT TABLE SPACE NOT ALLOWED
Explanation: A CREATE TABLE statement was issued using an implicit table space. An implicit table space may not
be used in a database that has been defined as a read-only shared database.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: CREATE a table space for the table, using the same name as is given on the owning system.
Then resubmit the CREATE TABLE statement.
SQLSTATE: 56056
-739 CREATE OR ALTER FUNCTION function-name FAILED BECAUSE FUNCTIONS CANNOT MODIFY DATA WHEN THEY ARE PROCESSED IN PARALLEL.
Explanation: The function cannot be created or altered because ALLOW PARALLEL and MODIFIES SQL DATA
were both specified explicitly or implicitly. A function cannot be parallelized if it modifies data.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Specify DISALLOW PARALLEL or change the MODIFIES SQL DATA to NO SQL,
CONTAINS SQL or READS SQL DATA.
SQLSTATE: 56088
-740 FUNCTION name IS DEFINED WITH THE OPTION MODIFIES SQL DATA WHICH IS NOT VALID IN THE CONTEXT IN WHICH IT WAS INVOKED
Explanation: A user-defined function that is defined with the MODIFIES SQL DATA clause was invoked in an
invalid context.
name The name of the user-defined function.
A user-defined function that is defined with MODIFIES SQL DATA is only allowed in:
v A VALUES clause of an insert operation
v A SET clause of an update operation
v A VALUES statement in a trigger
v A SET Assignment statement
v A CALL procedure statement
System action: The SQL statement failed.
Programmer response: Remove the user-defined function from the failing statement. or remove the MODIFIES SQL
DATA option from the definition of the function.
SQLSTATE: 51034
-741 A database-type DATABASE IS ALREADY DEFINED FOR MEMBER member-name
Explanation: A CREATE DATABASE statement was issued for a WORK FILE or TEMP database, but the database
can not be created because one is already defined for the named DB2 subsystem or data sharing group member.
database-type
WORK FILE or TEMP
member-name
Name of the DB2 subsystem or data sharing group member that already has a database-type database.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Verify the identity and validity of the existing database-type database for the named DB2
subsystem or data sharing member. The existing database can be altered or dropped if necessary. If the existing
database is dropped, resubmit the CREATE DATABASE statement.
SQLSTATE: 55020
-742 DSNDB07 IS THE IMPLICIT WORK FILE DATABASE
Explanation: The WORKFILE clause cannot be used on a CREATE DATABASE statement to create a work file
database for a DB2 subsystem that is not a member of a DB2 data sharing group. The system database, DSNDB07, is
the implicit work file database.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: To create the work file database for a DB2 subsystem that is not a member of a DB2 data
sharing group, create database DSNDB07 without the WORKFILE clause.
SQLSTATE: 53004
-746 THE SQL STATEMENT IN FUNCTION, TRIGGER, OR IN STORED PROCEDURE name VIOLATES THE NESTING SQL RESTRICTION
Explanation: If a table is being modified (by INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, or MERGE), the table can not be accessed
by the lower level nesting SQL statement.
If any table is being accessed by a SELECT statement, no table can be modified (by INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, or
MERGE) in any lower level nesting SQL statement.
System action: The SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE or MERGE SQL statement failed.
Programmer response: Remove the failing statement from the named function, trigger or the stored procedure.
SQLSTATE: 57053
-747 TABLE table-name IS NOT AVAILABLE UNTIL THE AUXILIARY TABLES AND INDEXES FOR ITS EXTERNALLY STORED COLUMNS HAVE BEEN CREATED
Explanation: An attempt was made to access or reference a table with one or more LOB columns, however either
v an auxiliary table for storing one of the LOB columns has not been created, or
v an index has not been created for an auxiliary table, or
v there is not an auxiliary table for each partition of the table space.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response:
v Use CREATE TABLESPACE to create a LOB table space.
v Use CREATE TABLE to create the auxiliary table for storing the column.
v Use CREATE INDEX to create an index on the auxiliary table.
v Resubmit the statement that failed.
SQLSTATE: 57054
-748 AN INDEX index-name ALREADY EXISTS ON AUXILIARY TABLE table-name
Explanation: The CREATE INDEX statement would create a second index on the specified auxiliary table. An
auxiliary table can have only one index.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: An index already exists. Another index cannot be created.
SQLSTATE: 54042
-750 THE SOURCE TABLE table-name CANNOT BE RENAMED OR ALTERED BECAUSE IT IS REFERENCED IN AN EXISTING VIEW, MATERIALIZED QUERY TABLE, OR IS A CLONE TABLE, OR HAS A CLONE TABLE DEFINED FOR IT.
Explanation: An attempt was made to rename or alter a table, but the table could not be renamed or altered.
table-name
The name of the table.
Possible reasons for this error include, but are not limited to:
General cases
v The column is referenced in one or more view definitions.
v The column is referenced in one or more materialized table definitions.
v The column has a check constraint or field procedure defined on it.
v The column has an expression-based index defined on it.
v The column is referenced in a user-defined SQL table function.
v The table has a valid procedure or edit procedure defined on it.
v The table is a clone table.
v The table has a clone table defined for it.
v The table has a synonym defined for it.
v The table is defined as an active resource limit table.
v The table is a system-period temporal table.
v The table is a history table.
ALTER TABLE statements
v In an ALTER TABLE statement, a column in the indicated table cannot be renamed for one of the
following reasons:
¨C The column is referenced in one or more view definitions.
¨C The column is referenced in a check constraint.
¨C The column has a field procedure defined.
¨C The trigger is defined on the table.
¨C The table has a valid procedure or an edit procedure that is defined with row attribute sensitivity.
¨C An index is defined on the table with an expression that references the column.
¨C The definition of one or more materialized query tables references the table.
¨C The table is a system period temporal table or a history table.
v For an ALTER TABLE statement that names a materialized query table, the alterations are limited to the
following situations:
¨C Changing the materialized query table attributes.
¨C Turning the materialized query table to a base table.
¨C Specifying the following clauses:
- ADD RESTRICT ON DROP
- ALTER MATERIALIZED QUERY
- AUDIT
- DATA CAPTURE
- DROP MATERIALIZED QUERY
- DROP RESTRICT ON DROP
ADD RESTRICT ON DROP and DROP RESTRICT ON DROP clauses cannot be used in the same
statement.
v The length of a column in the indicated table cannot be altered because the table is referenced by a
materialized query table definition.
v The ALTER TABLE statement was executed using the ALTER COLUMN clause, and names a table which
is referenced by a materialized table query.
v The ALTER TABLE statement was executed using the ALTER COLUMN clause, but columns are
referenced by a view that is referenced by materialized table query.
v The ALTER TABLE statement was executed using the SET DEFAULT clause, and names a table which is
referenced by a materialized table query or view.
ALTER VIEW statements
v An ALTER VIEW REGENERATE statement was executed, but the specified view is referenced by a
materialized table.
RENAME TABLE statements
v A RENAME statement specifies a materialized query table (MQT). Materialized query tables cannot be
renamed.
v The table is a system period temporal table or a history table.
v The table is an accelerator-only table.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the source name to the name of an object that can be renamed or altered, and
reissue the statement.
Drop any triggers defined on the table before issuing the RENAME statement. To find these triggers, query the
system catalog.
Drop any view that reference the table before issuing the RENAME statement. To find these views, query the system
catalog.
If there is a clone defined on the table, drop the clone table before issuing the RENAME statement.

-751 object-type object-name (SPECIFIC NAME specific name) ATTEMPTED TO EXECUTE AN SQL STATEMENT sql-statement THAT IS NOT ALLOWED
Explanation: A stored procedure or user-defined function attempted to execute an SQL statement that is not
allowed.
object-type
The type of object:
Stored procedure
A stored procedure issued an SQL statement that forced the DB2 thread to roll back the unit of
work. The SQL statement that caused the thread to be placed in the MUST_ROLLBACK state is
either COMMIT or ROLLBACK:
All further SQL statements are rejected until the SQL application that issued the SQL CALL
statement rolls back the unit of work. When control returns to the SQL application that issued the
SQL CALL statement, the SQL application must roll back the unit of work. This can be done by
issuing an SQL ROLLBACK statement or the equivalent IMS or CICS operation.
User-defined function
The external function that is indicated by object-name issued either a COMMIT or ROLLBACK
statement.
object-name
The name of the object.
specific-name
The specific function name, which is unique within the schema.
sql-statement
The SQL statement that was issued.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Either remove all COMMIT and ROLLBACK statements from the stored procedure, or
modify the client application so that it establishes an environment that allows the stored procedure to execute
statements. Remotely called stored procedures can execute embedded COMMIT or ROLLBACK statements if the
following conditions are met:
v The connection with the requester system must use one phase commit protocols.
v The requester system must indicate that commits are allowed by sending a DRDA RDBCMTOK=TRUE indication
when the stored procedure is called.
For DB2 Connect? requester systems, the client application must use either Connect Type 1 or Remote Unit of
Work connections. Other connections cause DB2 Connect to indicate that commits are not allowed, which will
cause COMMIT and ROLLBACK statements in a stored procedure to fail.

-752 THE CONNECT STATEMENT IS INVALID BECAUSE THE PROCESS IS NOT IN THE CONNECTABLE STATE
Explanation: The application process attempted to execute a CONNECT statement while in the unconnectable state.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The connection state of the application process is unchanged.
Programmer response: Modify the application program to execute a commit or rollback operation prior to executing
the CONNECT statement.

-763 INVALID TABLE SPACE NAME space-name
Explanation: The named table space is invalid.
space-name
The name of the table space.
Possible reasons for this error include:
v It is a LOB table space and therefore cannot reside in a work file database.
v It is a LOB table space and therefore cannot contain a non-auxiliary table.
v It is not a LOB table space and therefore cannot contain an auxiliary table.
v It is a LOB table space and LOGGED was specified, but the associated base table space is defined as NOT
LOGGED.
v It is a hash table and therefore can exist only in a range-partitioned universal table space or a partition-by-growth
table space. Hash tables cannot be created XML table spaces or in any other type of table space, and tables cannot
be altered to use hash access unless they are of one of those types.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Take the appropriate action:
v Create the LOB table space in a non-workfile database.
v Create the table in a non-LOB table space.
v Create the auxiliary table in a LOB table space.
v Create a LOB table space and do not specify LOGGED.
v For a hash-organized table, create a universal table space that is not an XML or LOB table space.
SQLSTATE: 560A1
-764 A LOB TABLE SPACE AND ITS ASSOCIATED BASE TABLE SPACE MUST BE IN THE SAME DATABASE
Explanation: An attempt was made to create an auxiliary table in a LOB table space that is not in the same database
as the associated base table space.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the statement to specify a LOB table space in the same database as the associated
base table space.
SQLSTATE: 560A2
-765 TABLE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH DATABASE
Explanation: A CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement defines a LOB column in a table whose database
attribute is ROSHARE OWNER or ROSHARE READ. This is not permitted.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If CREATE TABLE, either assign the table to an ROSHARE NONE database or create the
table without a LOB column. If ALTER TABLE, redefine the column as a non-LOB column or move the table to an
ROSHARE NONE database.
SQLSTATE: 560A3
-766 THE OBJECT OF A STATEMENT IS A TABLE FOR WHICH THE REQUESTED OPERATION IS NOT PERMITTED
Explanation: The requested operation is not valid for the table that was specified in the SQL statement.
This error can occur when the statement violates one of the following requirements, depending on the type of table:
Accelerator-only table
An accelerator-only table must not be specified in any of the following statements:
v A CREATE SYNONYM statement to define a synonym.
v A CREATE TRIGGER statement to define a trigger for the accelerator-only table.
v A LOCK TABLE statement.
v A CREATE INDEX statement.
Auxiliary table
An auxiliary table for a LOB column must not be specified as the target of the following statements:
v ALTER TABLE
v CREATE ALIAS
v CREATE FUNCTION
v CREATE SYNONYM
v CREATE VIEW
v DELETE
v DESCRIBE TABLE
v INSERT
v MERGE
v SELECT
v TRUNCATE
v UPDATE
Attributes of an auxiliary table cannot be altered. However, the APPEND attributes of auxiliary tables can be
altered.
Aliases and synonyms cannot be created on an auxiliary table.
Data in an auxiliary table cannot be accessed by specifying the auxiliary table name in the SELECT, INSERT,
DELETE, UPDATE, MERGE, CREATE PROCEDURE, or CREATE FUNCTION statement. Data in an
auxiliary table can be accessed only through operations on the base table columns.
CLUSTER cannot be specified on an ALTER TABLE statement if the table is an auxiliary table.
Implicitly created table for an XML column
An implicitly created table for an XML column must not be specified as the target of the following
statements:
v ALTER TABLE
v CREATE ALIAS
v CREATE FUNCTION
v CREATE INDEX
v CREATE SYNONYM
v CREATE TRIGGER
v CREATE VIEW
v DELETE
v DESCRIBE TABLE
v INSERT
v MERGE
v REVOKE
v SELECT
v TRUNCATE
v UPDATE
Table with system-period data versioning
A table with system-period data versioning must be the only table in the table space, and it must not be any
of the following types of tables:
v An incomplete table
v An auxiliary table
v A clone table or a table with a clone defined on it
v A table that was implicitly created for an XML column
v A table that contains a security label column
A security label column cannot be added to a system-period temporal table.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the statement to specify the corresponding base table instead of the specified table,
and resubmit the statement.

Explanation: The CREATE INDEX statement failed for one of the following reasons:
v An index on a non-auxiliary table must specify the columns on which the index is defined.
v An index on an auxiliary table must not have a column specification.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the syntax of the CREATE INDEX statement.
v To create an index on a non-auxiliary table, specify the columns on which the index is defined.
v To create an index on an auxiliary table, do not specify the name of any column.
SQLSTATE: 42626
-768 AN AUXILIARY TABLE ALREADY EXISTS FOR THE SPECIFIED COLUMN OR PARTITION
Explanation: An attempt was made to create an auxiliary table, but an auxiliary table for the specified column or
partition already exists. When the base table belongs to a non-partitioned table space, there can be only one auxiliary
table per LOB column of the table. When the base table belongs to a partitioned table space, for any given LOB
column, all values of the LOB column for a given partition are stored in their own auxiliary table. There must be one
auxiliary table per partition of the base table space.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Check that the correct table name, column name, and if applicable, partition number have
been specified. If the existing auxiliary table needs to have a different name, execute the RENAME TABLE statement
to rename the auxiliary table.
SQLSTATE: 560A5
-769 SPECIFICATION OF CREATE AUX TABLE DOES NOT MATCH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BASE TABLE
Explanation: Either an attempt was made to create an auxiliary table
v using the PART clause and the specified base table is not partitioned or
v without using the PART clause and the specified base table is partitioned
If the base table is not partitioned, then the PART keyword is not allowed on the CREATE AUXILIARY TABLE
statement. If the base table is partitioned, then the PART keyword must be specified.
System action: The auxiliary table was not created.
Programmer response: Check whether the name of the base table specified in the CREATE AUXILIARY TABLE
statement is correct. If it is correct and the table is not partitioned, remove the PART clause from the statement. If it is
correct and the table is partitioned, add the PART clause to the statement. If the table name is not correct, correct the
name and also check that the correct column name is specified.
SQLSTATE: 53096
-770 TABLE table-name CANNOT HAVE A LOB COLUMN UNLESS IT ALSO HAS A ROWID, OR AN XML COLUMN UNLESS IT ALSO HAS A DOCID COLUMN
Explanation:
table-name
The name of the table.
An attempt was made to create a table, table-name, with a column that has a dependency on another type of column
in the same table. This error can occur in the following situations:
v The statement attempted to create a table with a LOB column or to add a LOB column to a table, but the table
does not have a ROWID column. A table with a LOB column must also have a ROWID column.
v The statement attempted to create a table with an XML column or to add an XML column to a table, but the table
does not have a DOCID column. A table with an XML column must also have a DOCID column.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If creating a table, define an additional column for the ROWID or DOCID column in the
same table.
SQLSTATE: 560A6
-771 INVALID SPECIFICATION OF A ROWID COLUMN
Explanation: For an ALTER TABLE or CREATE TABLE statement, the specification of a ROWID column might be
invalid for one of the following reasons:
v A ROWID column cannot be added to a temporary table.
v A ROWID column cannot be specified in a referential-constraint clause as a column of a foreign key.
v A ROWID column cannot be a column of a primary key or unique key.
v A ROWID column cannot be a column in a table with an edit procedure that is defined with row attribute
sensitivity.
v A ROWID column cannot be part of the implicit or explicit column list for fullselect in the as-result-table clause of a
CREATE TABLE or DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the syntax and resubmit the statement.

-773 CASE NOT FOUND FOR CASE STATEMENT
Explanation: A case statement without an ELSE clause was specified in the body of an SQL routine. None of the
conditions specified in the CASE statement were met.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the CASE statement to handle all of the conditions that can occur.
SQLSTATE: 20000
-775 STATEMENT SPECIFIED IN SQL ROUTINE IS NOT ALLOWED WITHIN A COMPOUND STATEMENT.
Explanation: A statement specified in the routine body is not allowed in a compound statement. An ATOMIC
compound statement cannot be specified:
v In an SQL scalar function.
v In an SQL procedure.
v Within another compound statement that is defined as ATOMIC.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Remove the statement from the SQL routine, and retry your operation.
SQLSTATE: 42910
-776 USE OF CURSOR cursor-name IS NOT VALID
Explanation: Cursor cursor-name is specified as the cursor name on a FOR statement in an SQL procedure. The
cursor cannot be specified on a CLOSE, FETCH, or OPEN statement within the FOR statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Remove the CLOSE, FETCH, or OPEN statement.
SQLSTATE: 428D4
-778 ENDING LABEL label-name DOES NOT MATCH THE BEGINNING LABEL
Explanation: The label that is specified at the end of a compound, WHILE, REPEAT, or LOOP statement in an SQL
routine is not the same as the label at the beginning of the statement. The end label cannot be specified if the begin
label is not specified.
label-name
The name given for the ending label.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Ensure that the end label is the same as the begin label for the compound, WHILE, REPEAT, or
LOOP statement.
SQLSTATE: 428D5
-779 LABEL label SPECIFIED ON A GOTO, ITERATE, OR LEAVE STATEMENT IS NOT VALID
Explanation: Label label is specified as the target label for a GOTO, ITERATE or LEAVE statement. label is not
defined, is not defined in a scope that is accessible to the current statement, or to the current statement, or it is not a
valid label for the failing statement.
This error can occur with a GOTO, ITERATE or LEAVE statement for one of the following reasons:
v If the failing statement is in a condition handler, then label must be defined in that condition handler.
v If the failing statement is not in a condition handler, then label must not be defined in a condition handler.
Additionally, this error can be issued for ITERATE or LEAVE statements for one of the following reasons:
v If the failing statement is an ITERATE statement, then label must be defined as a label for a FOR, LOOP, REPEAT,
or WHILE statement, and the ITERATE statement must be in that FOR, LOOP, REPEAT, or WHILE statement, or in
a block of code that is directly or indirectly nested within that statement.
v If the failing statement is a LEAVE statement, then label must be defined as a label for a compound, FOR, LOOP,
REPEAT, or WHILE statement, and the LEAVE statement must be in that compound, FOR, LOOP, REPEAT, or
WHILE statement, or in a block of code that is directly or indirectly nested within that statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Specify a valid label for the target of the GOTO, ITERATE, or LEAVE statement.
SQLSTATE: 42736
-780 UNDO SPECIFIED FOR A HANDLER
Explanation: In an SQL routine, a compound statement contains an UNDO handler. UNDO handlers are not
supported.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Change the UNDO handler to a CONTINUE or EXIT handler.
SQLSTATE: 428D6
-781 CONDITION condition-name IS NOT DEFINED OR THE DEFINITION IS NOT IN SCOPE
Explanation: A condition was specified in a handler declaration, SIGNAL, or RESIGNAL statement, but either the
condition is not defined in the routine or the reference to the condition name is not in the scope of the declaration of
the condition name.
condition-name
The name of the condition that is not defined.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Define the condition using the DECLARE CONDITION statement in a compound statement, and
verify that the reference is in the same scope as the declaration. Alternately, you can remove the reference to the
condition.
SQLSTATE: 42737

-782 A CONDITION OR SQLSTATE condition-value SPECIFIED IS NOT VALID
Explanation: An SQL routine specified a condition value that is not valid.
condition-value
Either a specific condition value, which is provided as an SQLSTATE value, or a general condition value,
such as SQLEXCEPTION, SQLWARNING, or NOT FOUND.
The condition or SQLSTATE value is not valid for one of the following reasons:
v The handler declaration or condition declaration specifies an SQLSTATE value that is not valid.
v The condition or SQLSTATE value has already been specified by another handler in the same scope.
v The condition or SQLSTATE was specified in the same handler as SQLEXCEPTION, SQLWARNING, or NOT
FOUND.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Correct the condition or SQLSTATE value.
SQLSTATE: 428D7
-783 SELECT LIST FOR CURSOR cursor-name IN FOR STATEMENT IS NOT VALID. COLUMN column-name IS NOT UNIQUE
Explanation: The SELECT list in the FOR statement must contain unique column names. The SELECT list specified
either contains duplicate column names or unnamed expressions.
v If two column names are the same, the column name is column-name.
v If the problem is the result of unnamed expressions then *N is returned for column-name.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Specify unique column names in the SELECT list specified in the FOR statement.
SQLSTATE: 42738
-784 CONSTRAINT constraint-name CANNOT BE DROPPED.
Explanation: A constraint that is implicitly generated when a BUSINESS_TIME period is defined cannot be dropped
using an ALTER TABLE statement with either a DROP CHECK or DROP CONSTRAINT clause.
constraint-name
The name of the constraint that cannot be dropped.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: No action is required.
SQLSTATE: 42860
Related reference:
ALTER TABLE (DB2 SQL)
-785 USE OF SQLCODE OR SQLSTATE IS NOT VALID
Explanation: The use of SQLCODE or SQLSTATE in an SQL routine body is invalid for one of the following
reasons:
v SQLCODE or SQLSTATE was specified as a parameter name.
v SQLCODE is not declared as INTEGER in a return-codes-declaration clause.
v SQLSTATE is not declared as CHAR(5) in a return-codes-declaration clause.
v SQLCODE or SQLSTATE is assigned the value NULL.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Correct the parameter list, declaration of an SQLCODE or SQLSTATE variable, or correct the
assignment of a value to an SQLCODE or SQLSTATE variable.
SQLSTATE: 428D8
-787 RESIGNAL STATEMENT ISSUED OUTSIDE OF A HANDLER
Explanation: The RESIGNAL statement, specified in an SQL procedure, must be specified inside a handler.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Remove the RESIGNAL statement or use a SIGNAL statement. Try the request again.
SQLSTATE: 0K000
-797 THE TRIGGER trigger-name IS DEFINED WITH AN UNSUPPORTED TRIGGERED SQL STATEMENT
Explanation: The trigger definition includes an unsupported triggered SQL statement. The SQL statements that are
allowed as a triggered SQL statement are specified in CREATE TRIGGER (DB2 SQL).
System action: The CREATE TRIGGER statement cannot be executed, and the trigger is not created.
Programmer response: Check the triggered SQL statements in the trigger for any statement that is not listed in
CREATE TRIGGER (DB2 SQL), and remove the statement.
SQLSTATE: 42987
Related reference:
CREATE TRIGGER (DB2 SQL)
-798 A VALUE CANNOT BE SPECIFIED FOR COLUMN column-name WHICH IS DEFINED AS GENERATED ALWAYS
Explanation: When inserting or updating a row in a table, a value was specified for a column that is defined with
GENERATE ALWAYS attributes, its value is not being set with the DEFAULT keyword, and:
v Extended indicator variable values are not enabled.
v Extended indicator variable values are enabled, but neither of the expected values DEFAULT (-5) or UNASSIGNED
(-7) were provided.
column-name
The name of the column.
GENERATED ALWAYS columns should not be specified in the column list for an insert operation, or in the SET
clause for an update operation unless the keyword DEFAULT is specified.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Remove the column from the column list or SET clause, or specify DEFAULT as the column
value.
You can use the OVERRIDING USER VALUE clause on an INSERT statement as a possible solution for this situation.

-802 EXCEPTION ERROR exception-type HAS OCCURRED DURING operation-type OPERATION ON data-type DATA, POSITION position-number
Explanation: An exception error has occurred in the processing of an SQL arithmetic function or arithmetic
expression. The exception error occurred in one of the following areas:
v In the SELECT list of an SQL SELECT statement.
v In the search condition of a SELECT, UPDATE, MERGE, or DELETE statement.
v In the SET clause of the UPDATE operation.
v During the evaluation of an aggregate function.
Parts of exception-type, operation-type, data-type, and position-number might not be returned to the SQL communication
area, depending on where the error was detected.
exception-type
Indicates the type of error.
Possible values for exception-type are:
v FIXED POINT OVERFLOW
v DECIMAL OVERFLOW
v ZERO DIVIDE
v DIVIDE EXCEPTION
v EXPONENT OVERFLOW
v INVALID OPERATION
v SUBNORMAL
v UNDERFLOW
v OVERFLOW
v OUT OF RANGE
operation-type
Indicates the operation that was being performed at the time of the error. Possible operation-type includes the
following arithmetic operations:
v ADDITION
v SUBTRACTION
v MULTIPLICATION
v DIVISION
v NEGATION
operation-type might also be one of the following operations:
v A built-in function
v An aggregate function
v Java conversion
data-type
The data types of the items being manipulated.
Possible values for data-type include the following data types:
v BIGINT
v INTEGER
v SMALLINT
v DECIMAL
v FLOAT
The data type displayed in the message might indicate the data type of the temporary internal copy of the
data, which can differ from the actual column or literal data type due to conversions by DB2.
position-number
The position of the expression in a SELECT list if the error was in the SELECT list of an outer SELECT
statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. In the case of an insert or update operation, no data is updated
or deleted. If the statement was a cursor-controlled FETCH, the cursor will remain open unless the exception
occurred while processing an aggregate function (indicated by operation-type of AGGREGATE FUNCTION), in which
case the cursor will be closed. If the cursor is closed, subsequent attempts to use that cursor without first doing an
OPEN for it receive an SQLCODE -501. If the statement was a cursor-controlled OPEN, the cursor will remain closed.
Programmer response: Examine the SQL statement to see if the cause of the problem can be determined. The
problem might be data-dependent, in which case it will be necessary to examine the data that was being processed at
the time the error occurred.
If the arithmetic expression in error was within the SELECT list of the outer SELECT statement, it is advisable to
include an indicator variable for all expressions in the SELECT list. This allows processing to continue so that
non-error column and expression values can be returned.
See the explanation of SQLCODE -405 for allowed ranges of numeric data types.
Problem determination: A fixed point overflow can occur during any arithmetic operation on BIGINT, INTEGER, or
SMALLINT fields.
A divide exception can occur on a decimal division operation when the quotient exceeds the specified data field size.
A zero divide occurs on a division by zero.
An exponent overflow can occur when the result characteristic of any floating-point operation exceeds 127 and the
result fraction is not zero, for example, the magnitude of the result exceeds approximately 7.2E+75.
A decimal overflow exception can occur under either of the following circumstances:
v One or more non-zero digits are lost because the destination field in any decimal operation is too short to contain
the result.
v A Java stored procedure or user-defined function sets a decimal value in an output parameter that has a precision
or scale too small for the value. operation-type is Java conversion. data-type is DECIMAL. position-number indicates
which parameter of the CALL statement or user-defined function invocation is in error.
Any of the exception or overflow conditions can occur during the processing of a built-in function. If the
operation-type is FUNCTION, the error occurred while processing either an input, intermediate, or final value. The
exception can occur because the value of a parameter is out of range.
SQLSTATE: 22012 if ZERO DIVIDE.  22003 if other than ZERO DIVIDE.  
-803 AN INSERTED OR UPDATED VALUE IS INVALID BECAUSE THE INDEX IN INDEX SPACE indexspace-name CONSTRAINS COLUMNS OF THE TABLE SO NO TWO ROWS CAN CONTAIN DUPLICATE VALUES IN THOSE COLUMNS. RID OF EXISTING ROW IS X record-id
Explanation: The table that is the object of the insert or update operation is constrained to have unique values in
certain columns. Completion of the requested operation would result in duplicate values.
indexspace-name
The name of a hash overflow index or the name of the index space that contains the unique index that
enforces a primary key.
record-id
The record ID of the row where the duplicate values would exist.
When indexspace-name identifies a hash overflow index, the error occurred because a table with hash organization
cannot have two rows with identical hash key values.
If the index space is an XML index, the duplicate values can be caused by the values in the XML document or by the
result of data type conversion and rounding.
Otherwise, a primary key, unique constraint, or unique index exists over one or more columns of the table. The
operation cannot be performed because one or more values would have produced a duplicate key in the unique
index or constraint.
If a view is the object of the insert or update statement, the table that defines the view is constrained. The update
might also be caused by a delete operation of a parent row that cascades to a dependent row with a delete rule of
SET NULL.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Examine the definitions for UNIQUE INDEX or the HASH key that is specified in the index
space that is identified by indexspace-name to determine the uniqueness constraint that is imposed. Refer to
SYSIBM.SYSINDEXES for the index space name and the associated index name.
Update operation
Verify that the specified operation is consistent with the uniqueness constraint. If this does not indicate the
error, examine the object table to determine the cause of the problem.
Insert operation
Examine the object table to determine which values violate the uniqueness constraint. If the INSERT
statement contains a subquery, match the contents of the table addressed by the subquery and the contents
of the object table to determine the cause of the problem.
Delete operation
Examine the index key columns in the table that defines the index. These columns contain a foreign key,
which when set NULL on a cascade delete from the object table, causes the duplicate values.
Merge operation
Verify that the specified operation is consistent with the uniqueness constraint. If this does not indicate the
error, examine the object table to determine the cause of the problem. In very rare cases, the error can be
caused by another INSERT/UPDATE statement which modified the object table during the processing of
MERGE statement. Under such circumstances, examine your applications and make appropriate changes to
handle concurrency. For example, changing the isolation level or running the MERGE statement again might
avoid the problem.

-804 AN ERROR WAS FOUND IN THE APPLICATION PROGRAM INPUT PARAMETERS FOR THE SQL STATEMENT, REASON reason
Explanation: The call parameter list or the SQLDA is invalid.
v The call parameter list, which is created by the precompiler, might be invalid if the application programmer has
modified the output of the precompiler, used a variable name beginning with 'SQL' in the application program, or
overwritten the call parameter list in some other way.
v The SQLDA, which is created by the application program, has an invalid data type or data length.
v The value of SQLDABC is not consistent with the value of SQLD.
The following is the list of reason codes:
01 Open issued for non-cursor.
02 Close issued for non-cursor.
03 Prepare of EXECUTE IMMEDIATE.
04 Statement is not recognized.
05 No statement string present.
06 Bad SQLDA format in parameter list.
07 SQLDA length is invalid.
08 Unrecognized input data type.
09 Invalid length for input variable.
10 Invalid data length for output variable.
11 The value of SQLDABC is not consistent with the value of SQLD.
12 Invalid input data pointer.
13 Invalid output data pointer.
14 SQLN has too many items for SQLDABC.
15 Input RDI pointer is invalid.
16 Unrecognized output data type.
17 The value of the 7th byte of SQLDAID is not consistent with the data types contained in the SQLDA. The
SQLDA contains a LOB type host variable, but the 7th byte of SQLDAID is not set to '2' or greater to
indicate that the extended SQLVARs have been allocated.
19 Invalid program name.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
System programmer response: Examine the application program for any of the errors noted under the explanation
above. In general, the application programmer should not attempt to modify the output of the precompiler.
SQLSTATE: 07002
-805 DBRM OR PACKAGE NAME location-name.collection-id.dbrm-name.consistency-token NOT FOUND IN PLAN plan-name. REASON reason-code
Explanation: An application program attempted to use a DBRM or package that was not found.
location-name.collection-id.dbrm-name.consistency-token
The package that was not found. The collection-id is blank if the CURRENT PACKAGESET special register
was blank for the local program execution.
plan-name
The name of the plan.
reason-code
A numeric value that indicates the reason for the failure.
01
v The DBRM name was not found in the member list of the plan and there is no package list for
the plan.
Problem determination: Query 1
Corrective action: Add the DBRM that is identified by dbrm-name to the MEMBER list of the
BIND subcommand and bind the application plan that is identified by plan-name.
v The package name was not found because there is no package list for the plan.
Problem determination: Query 2
Corrective action: Add the PKLIST option with the appropriate package list entry to the REBIND
subcommand and rebind the application plan that is identified by plan-name.
02 The DBRM name dbrm-name did not match an entry in the member list or the package list. Any of
the following conditions could be the problem:
BIND conditions
v The collection-id in the package list was not correct when the application plan that is
identified by plan-name was bound.
Problem determination: Query 2
Corrective action: Correct the collection ID of the entry in the PKLIST option and use
the REBIND subcommand to rebind the application plan that is identified by plan-name.
v The location-name in the package list was not correct when the application plan that is
identified by plan-name was bound.
Problem determination: Query 2
Corrective action: Correct the location name of the entry in the PKLIST option and use
the REBIND subcommand to rebind the application plan that is identified by plan-name.
v The location-name in the CURRENTSERVER option for the BIND subcommand was not
correct when the application plan that is identified by plan-name was bound.
Problem determination: Query 3
Corrective action: Correct the location name in the CURRENTSERVER option and use
the REBIND subcommand to rebind the application plan that is identified by plan-name.
Application conditions
v The CURRENT PACKAGESET special register was not set correctly by the application.
When using SET CURRENT PACKAGESET = :HV, be sure to use the correct encoding
scheme, which must match the :HV in subsystem parameter options. This statement
does not require package or DBRM bound into the plan, so it uses the encoding scheme
defined for system. The same condition applies to SET CURRENT PACKAGE PATH.
Corrective action: Set the CURRENT PACKAGESET special register correctly.
v The application was not connected to the proper location.
Corrective action: Connect to the correct location.
03 The DBRM name that is identified by dbrm-name matched one or more entries in the package list
and the search of those entries did not find the package. Any of the conditions that are listed for
reason-code value 02 are possible causes for reason-code value 03, as are the following additional
conditions:
v The DBRM of the version of the application program being executed was not bound. (A package
with the same consistency token as that of the application program was not found.)
Problem determination: Query 4
Corrective action: Bind the DBRM of the version of the application program to be executed into
the collection that is identified by collection-id.
v The incorrect version of the application program is being executed.
Corrective action: Execute the correct version of the application program. The consistency token
of the application program is the same as the package that was bound.
04
The package does not exist at the remote site, which is identified by the location-name value.
Problem determination: Query 4
blank The reason-code value is blank if the length of location-name is 16, the length of collection-id is 18, and
the length of dbrm-name is 8 due to the length of SQLERRMT.
In a native SQL procedure, if the affected SQL statement follows a SET CURRENT PACKAGESET, SET CURRENT
PACKAGE PATH, or CONNECT statement, or if it refers to an object on a remote server, additional packages must
be bound using BIND COPY. Whenever the native SQL procedure is changed such that a regeneration is needed, the
additional package also needs to be bound with the copy option.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Use the information that is provided for the reason-code to resolve the problem.
Problem determination: The following queries aid in determining the problem. Run these queries at the local
location.
Query 1: Display the DBRMs in the member list for the plan
SELECT PLCREATOR, PLNAME, NAME, VERSION
FROM SYSIBM.SYSDBRM
WHERE PLNAME = ¡¯plan-name¡¯;
If no rows are returned, then the plan was bound without a member list.
Query 2: Display the entries in the package list for the plan
SELECT LOCATION, COLLID, NAME
FROM SYSIBM.SYSPACKLIST
WHERE PLANNAME = ¡¯plan-name¡¯;
If no rows are returned, then the plan was bound without a package list.
Query 3: Display the CURRENTSERVER value specified on the BIND subcommand for the plan.
SELECT NAME, CURRENTSERVER
FROM SYSIBM.SYSPLAN
WHERE NAME = ¡¯plan-name¡¯;
Query 4: Determine if there is a matching package in SYSPACKAGE
If the package is remote, put the location name in the FROM clause.
If the collection-id value in the message is blank, use this version of the query:
SELECT COLLID, NAME, HEX(CONTOKEN), VERSION
FROM location-name.SYSIBM.SYSPACKAGE
WHERE NAME = ¡¯dbrm-name¡¯
AND HEX(CONTOKEN) = ¡¯consistency-token¡¯;
If the collection-id value in the message is not blank, use this version of the query:
SELECT COLLID, NAME, HEX(CONTOKEN), VERSION
FROM location-name.SYSIBM.SYSPACKAGE
WHERE NAME = ¡¯dbrm-name¡¯
AND HEX(CONTOKEN) = ¡¯consistency-token¡¯
AND COLLID = ¡¯collection-id¡¯;
If no rows are returned, the correct version of the package was not bound.
SQLSTATE: 51002
-807 ACCESS DENIED: PACKAGE package-name IS NOT ENABLED FOR ACCESS FROM connection-type connection-name
Explanation: Access is denied for one of the following reasons:
v It is disabled, either from the 'connection-type' or from the 'connection-type' with the specific 'connection-name'.
v The attach library that you are using is from a previous release of DB2 that does not support the ENABLE and
DISABLE options of the bind operation.
The variables are:
package-name
The package name (collection.package-id).
connection-type
One of the following: BATCH, DB2CALL, REMOTE, IMSBMP, IMSMPP, CICS, DLIBATCH, or UNKNOWN.
connection-name
Name of the connection that is restricted. If all connection names from a specific connection-type are
restricted, this value is not specified.
System action: The statement is not executed and the package is not allocated.
System programmer response: One of the following:
v Rebind the package to enable it to execute with the required connection type and name.
v Check the SYSPLSYSTEM or SYSPKSYSTEM catalog table to find a connection from which the package can be
executed.
v Correct the attach library.
SQLSTATE: 23509
-808 THE CONNECT STATEMENT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRST CONNECT STATEMENT
Explanation: The CONNECT semantics that apply to an application process are determined by the first CONNECT
statement executed (successfully or unsuccessfully) by the application process. One of the following rules was
violated:
v A type 2 CONNECT statement cannot be executed after a type 1 CONNECT statement was executed.
v A type 1 CONNECT statement cannot be executed after a type 2 CONNECT statement was executed.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: The probable cause of this error is that different programs in the application process were
precompiled with different CONNECT options.
Ensure that the application process uses either type 1 or type 2 CONNECT statements and then resubmit the job. The
type of CONNECT to be used is a precompiler option. The default is type 2 CONNECT.
SQLSTATE: 08001
-811 THE RESULT OF AN EMBEDDED SELECT STATEMENT OR A SUBSELECT IN THE SET CLAUSE OF AN UPDATE STATEMENT IS A TABLE OF MORE THAN ONE ROW, OR THE RESULT OF A SUBQUERY OF A BASIC PREDICATE IS MORE THAN ONE VALUE
Explanation: Execution of an embedded SELECT statement or a subselect in the SET clause of an UPDATE
statement has resulted in a result table that contains more than one row. Alternatively, a subquery contained in a
basic predicate has produced more than one value.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Examine the syntax of the statement to ensure that it contains the proper condition
specifications. If the statement syntax is correct, there might be a problem with the data that is causing more than
one row or value to be returned when you do not expect it.
SQLSTATE: 21000
-812 THE SQL STATEMENT CANNOT BE PROCESSED BECAUSE A BLANK COLLECTION-ID WAS FOUND IN THE CURRENT PACKAGESET SPECIAL REGISTER WHILE TRYING TO FORM A QUALIFIED PACKAGE NAME FOR PROGRAM program-name.consistency-token USING PLAN plan-name
Explanation: The last entry or the only entry in the package list for the plan contained an asterisk (*) as the value of
the collection ID. The CURRENT PACKAGESET special register must be set to a nonblank collection ID to form a
qualified package name.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Set the CURRENT PACKAGESET special register to the correct collection ID, or ask your
system administrator to check the plan's package list for correctness.
If this error occurs in an application that is running under the IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ, you might
have too many concurrently open Statement, PreparedStatement, or CallableStatement objects. Modify your
application to decrease the number of concurrently open objects, or run the DB2Binder utility again with a larger
-size parameter value to increase the number of packages that are available to the driver.
SQLSTATE: 22508
-817 THE SQL STATEMENT CANNOT BE EXECUTED BECAUSE THE STATEMENT WILL RESULT IN A PROHIBITED DATA CHANGE OPERATION.
Explanation: The application attempted to execute an SQL statement that would result in updates to user data or to
the subsystem catalog. This is prohibited for one of the following reasons:
v The application is running as an IMS inquiry-only transaction.
v The application is an IMS, CICS, or RRSAF application that is attempting to update data at a remote DBMS that
does not support two-phase commit.
v The application is attempting to update data at multiple locations and one of the locations does not support
two-phase commit.
v A trigger defined with activation time BEFORE was activated and its triggered action caused updates to the
database.
v A CREATE TABLE statement for an accelerator-only table was followed by a data change operation for an
accelerator-only table.
These SQL statements include INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, GRANT, and REVOKE.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If the application is running as an IMS inquiry-only transaction, see your IMS system
programmer about changing the inquiry-only status of the transaction under which your application is running.
If the IMS, CICS, or RRSAF application is attempting a remote update, either the application must be changed to run
as a local application on the server DBMS, or the server DBMS must be upgraded to support two-phase commit.
If the application is attempting to update data at multiple locations, either the application must be changed, or all
DBMSs involved must be upgraded to support two-phase commit.
If the connection to the remote system is through VTAM?, ensure that the VTAM APPL statement specifies
SYNCLVL=SYNCPT.
If the error is due to an invalid statement during a trigger activation, contact your system administrator to correct the
trigger definition.

-818 THE PRECOMPILER-GENERATED TIMESTAMP x IN THE LOAD MODULE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE BIND TIMESTAMP y BUILT FROM THE DBRM z
Explanation: The timestamp that is stored in the application load module does not match the timestamp that is
stored in the plan or package. If the timestamps do not match, the application is not allowed to process the SQL
statement.
x The timestamp that was generated by the precompiler. This timestamp is a DB2 internal timestamp. It does
not have an external interpretation.
y The bind timestamp. This timestamp is a DB2 internal timestamp. It does not have an external
interpretation.
z The name of the database request module (DBRM).
The SQL precompiler places timestamp y in the DBRM and timestamp x in the parameter list in the application
program for each SQL statement. At bind time, DB2 stores the DBRM timestamp for run time use. At run time,
timestamp x for the SQL statement being processed is compared with timestamp y derived from the DBRM z at bind
time. If the two timestamps do not match, the DBRM and the application program were not the result of the same
precompile operation.
This problem can occur in the following cases:
v The application was precompiled, compiled, and linked, but was not bound.
v The application was precompiled and bound, but was not compiled and linked for the application program.
v The application was bound using a DBRM that resulted from a different precompile of the application program
than that which produced the object module that is linked into the application module.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Bind the application again, using the DBRM for the application program that matches the
load module.

-819 THE VIEW CANNOT BE PROCESSED BECAUSE THE LENGTH OF ITS PARSE TREE IN THE CATALOG IS ZERO
Explanation: SYSIBM.SYSVTREE.VTREE is a varying-length string column that contains the parse trees of views. In
processing a view, the length control field of its parse tree was found to be zero.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: This is a system error. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem.
For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
SQLSTATE: 58004
-820 THE SQL STATEMENT CANNOT BE PROCESSED BECAUSE catalog-table CONTAINS A VALUE THAT IS NOT VALID IN THIS RELEASE
Explanation: A column of the indicated catalog table contains a value that prevents further processing of an SQL
statement. The meaning of the value is unknown to the release of DB2. If a fall back has occurred, the value is
probably the result of the use of new function prior to the fall back.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Verify that the statement refers to the intended tables or views and that the problem is the
result of a fall back. If this is the case, the statement cannot be corrected because it depends on a function that is not
supported in the current release. If the problem is not the result of a fallback, -820 is a system error. If you suspect an
error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem,
see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
SQLSTATE: 58004
-822 THE SQLDA CONTAINS AN INVALID DATA ADDRESS OR INDICATOR VARIABLE ADDRESS
Explanation: The application program has placed an invalid address in the SQLDA.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the application program such that valid addresses are placed in SQLDA.
SQLSTATE: 51004
-840 TOO MANY ITEMS RETURNED IN A SELECT OR INSERT LIST
Explanation: The number of items returned in the SELECT list, specified in an INSERT list, or returned from an
invocation of UNNEST exceeds the allowable maximum of 750.
The number of items returned in the SELECT list or presented in an insert list exceeds the allowable maximum of 750.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Determine whether all the information is actually needed. For example, the number of items
that are returned by the SQL statement SELECT * FROM A, B, C is the sum of the number of columns in all three
tables. Not all column data might be needed.
Rewrite the SQL statement so that only the necessary items of information are returned, or break the SQL statement
into two or more statements.
SQLSTATE: 54004
-842 A CONNECTION TO location-name ALREADY EXISTS
Explanation: One of the following situations occurred:
v A CONNECT statement identifies a location with which the application process has a private connection, using
system-directed access.
v SQLRULES(STD) is in effect and a CONNECT statement identifies an existing SQL connection.
v A private connection, using system-directed access, cannot be established because of an existing SQL connection to
that location.
v A CONNECT (type 2) request that includes the USER/USING clause identifies an existing SQL connection.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: The correction depends on the error, as follows:
v If the location name is not the intended name, correct it.
v If SQLRULES(STD) is in effect and the CONNECT statement identifies an existing SQL connection, replace the
CONNECT with SET CONNECTION or change the option to SQLRULES(DB2).
v If the CONNECT statement identifies an existing private connection, destroy that connection (by using the
RELEASE statement in a previous unit of work) before executing the CONNECT statement. If the SQL statements
following the CONNECT can be executed using system-directed access, an alternative solution is to change the
application to use that method.
v If system-directed access cannot be used, destroy the conflicting SQL connection (by using the RELEASE statement
in a previous unit of work) before executing the SQL statement that requires system-directed access. An alternative
solution is to change the application so that only application-directed access is used.
v Destroy the connection (by using the RELEASE statement in a previous unik of work) before executing the
CONNECT statement which includes the USER/USING clause.
Correct the error in the application, rebind the plan or package, and resubmit the job.
SQLSTATE: 08002
-843 THE SET CONNECTION OR RELEASE STATEMENT MUST SPECIFY AN EXISTING CONNECTION
Explanation: One of the following rules was violated:
v A SET CONNECTION statement must identify an existing SQL connection of the application process.
v A RELEASE statement must identify an existing connection of the application process.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: The correction depends on the error, as follows:
v If the location name is not the intended name, correct it.
v If the location name does not identify an existing SQL connection, replace the SET CONNECTION with a
CONNECT statement.
v If RELEASE CURRENT was executed in the unconnected state or the specified location name does not identify an
existing SQL or DB2 private connection, delete the RELEASE statement.
Correct the error in the application, rebind, the plan and resubmit the job.
SQLSTATE: 08003
-845 A PREVIOUS VALUE EXPRESSION CANNOT BE USED BEFORE THE NEXT VALUE EXPRESSION GENERATES A VALUE IN THE CURRENT APPLICATION PROCESS FOR SEQUENCE sequence-name
Explanation: A PREVIOUS VALUE expression specified sequence sequence-name, but a value has not yet been
generated for this sequence. A NEXT VALUE expression must be issued in this application process to generate a
value for this sequence before a PREVIOUS VALUE expression for the sequence can be issued.
This error can also occur after a sequence has been dropped, and the DROP statement is rolled back.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Issue at least one NEXT VALUE expression for a sequence before issuing any PREVIOUS
VALUE expression for the same sequence in a connection.
SQLSTATE: 51035
-846 INVALID SPECIFICATION OF AN IDENTITY COLUMN OR SEQUENCE OBJECT object-type object-name. REASON CODE = reason-code
Explanation: For an identity column or sequence, the specification of an attribute in a CREATE or ALTER statement
might be invalid.
object-type
The type of object.
object-name
The name of the object.
reason-code
A numeric value that indicates the reason for the failure.
1 The underlying data type of the identity column or sequence object is not supported. Identity
columns and sequence objects support the following data types: SMALLINT, INTEGER, BIGINT,
and DECIMAL (or NUMERIC) with a scale of zero.
2 The value for START WITH, INCREMENT BY, MINVALUE, MAXVALUE, or RESTART WITH is
outside the range for the data type of the identity column or sequence object. If the sequence being
altered is DSNSEQ_IMPLICITDB, the value for MAXVALUE is outside the range between 1 and 60000, inclusive.  3 MINVALUE must be less than or equal to MAXVALUE.
4 An invalid value was specified for CACHE. The value must be an INTEGER with a minimum
value of 2.
5 An edit procedure that is defined with row attribute sensitivity was specified for the identity
column.
6 An identity column was specified for a global temporary table that was already defined by a
CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE statement. This error could occur for a CREATE GLOBAL
TEMPORARY TABLE statement, or an ALTER TABLE statement for a global temporary table when
there is an attempt to add an identity column to an existing global temporary table that was
already defined by a CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the syntax and resubmit the statement.
SQLSTATE: 42815
-867 INVALID SPECIFICATION OF A ROWID COLUMN
Explanation: For an ALTER TABLE or CREATE TABLE statement, the specification of a ROWID column might be
invalid for one of the following reasons:
v A ROWID column can not be added to a temporary table.
v The referential-constraint clause can not specify a ROWID column as a column of a foreign key.
v A ROWID column can not be a column of a primary key.
v A ROWID column can not be a column in a table with an edit procedure that is defined with row attribute
sensitivity.
If more than one exchange is attempted consecutively, then there must be a COMMIT between them. This COMMIT
is already required before DML can be done. If a COMMIT is not done between exchanges, then a -909 SQL code will
be issued.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the syntax and resubmit the statement.
SQLSTATE: 428C7

-870 THE NUMBER OF HOST VARIABLES IN THE STATEMENT IS NOT EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF DESCRIPTORS
Explanation: The number of host variables in the SQL statement does not match the number of host variable
descriptors.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the application program. The most likely cause of this problem is a missing colon
before a host variable.
Problem determination: If the SQL statement is bound locally, descriptors are built by the DB2 precompiler. For a
remote SQL statement, descriptors are built by DDF and are passed in the array SQLSTTVRB.
SQLSTATE: 58026
-872 A VALID CCSID HAS NOT YET BEEN SPECIFIED FOR THIS SUBSYSTEM
Explanation: A valid CCSID was not specified on either the ASCII CCSID, EBCDIC CCSID, or UNICODE CCSID
subsystem parameter on installation panel DSNTIPF.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Contact your system administrator to have the necessary CCSID defined for your system.
SQLSTATE: 51032
-873 THE STATEMENT REFERENCED DATA ENCODED WITH DIFFERENT ENCODING SCHEMES OR CCSIDS IN AN INVALID CONTEXT
Explanation: The SQL statement references data from multiple encoding schemes or CCSIDs in a context where the
reference is not allowed. This error can occur for one of the following reasons:
v The definition of a new table is specified to be 'like' an existing view which references data from multiple encoding
schemes.
v The parent and child tables referenced in the definition of a referential constraint containing one or more
non-numeric columns are encoded with different encoding schemes.
v The definition of a materialized query table uses a different encoding scheme than the containing table space.
v The SELECT statement references data that is encoded in multiple encoding schemes, and also contains an INSERT,
DELETE, UPDATE, or MERGE statement that references data that is encoded with a single encoding scheme.
v An INSTEAD OF trigger is created on a view that references multiple encodings or CCSIDs.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the SQL statement.
SQLSTATE: 53090
-874 THE ENCODING SCHEME SPECIFIED FOR THE object-type MUST BE THE SAME AS THE CONTAINING TABLE SPACE OR OTHER PARAMETERS
Explanation: A CCSID clause was incorrectly specified in one of the following situations:
v In a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement:
¨C CCSID ASCII was specified, and the containing table space is EBCDIC or UNICODE.
¨C CCSID EBCDIC was specified, and the containing table space is ASCII or UNICODE.
¨C CCSID UNICODE was specified, and the containing table space is ASCII or EBCDIC.
v In a fullselect that creates a table, the following items were not the same:
¨C The encoding scheme of the result table of the fullselect
¨C The encoding scheme in the CCSID clause (if specified)
¨C The encoding scheme of the target table space
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the SQL statement in one of the following ways:
v For a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement, make the CCSID value in the CREATE TABLE or ALTER
TABLE statement the same as the CCSID of the containing table space.
v For a fullselect that creates a table, make all of the following items the same:
¨C The encoding scheme of the result table of the fullselect
¨C The encoding scheme in the CCSID clause (if specified)
¨C The encoding scheme of the target table space
SQLSTATE: 53091
-875 operand CANNOT BE USED WITH THE ASCII DATA REFERENCED
Explanation: ASCII data was referenced in one of the following situations:
v A LIKE predicate refers to a mixed data column in an ASCII table. The LIKE predicate is not supported for mixed
ASCII data.
v A VARGRAPHIC function was specified for a column in an ASCII table. The VARGRAPHIC function is not
supported for ASCII data.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the SQL statement.
SQLSTATE: 42988
-876 object-type CANNOT BE CREATED OR ALTERED, REASON reason-code
Explanation: The object in the SQL statement cannot be created or altered.
object-type
The type of object that could not be created or altered:
TYPE 1 INDEX
The object that the SQL statement attempted to create is a type 1 index.
INDEX The object that the SQL statement attempted to create is an index.
TABLE The object that the SQL statement attempted to create or alter is a table.
TABLESPACE
The object that the SQL statement attempted to alter is a table space.
reason-code
A value that indicates the reason for the failure.
TABLE DEFINED AS ASCII
The underlying table is defined as ASCII. Only type 2 indexes are supported for ASCII tables.
PIECESIZE IS NOT VALID
PIECESIZE is only valid for non-partitioned indexes.
COLUMN NAME IN EBCDIC EXCEEDS 18 BYTES, OR THE CONVERSION FROM UNICODE TO
EBCDIC FAILED
The table that is being created or altered has an edit procedure that is defined with row attribute
sensitivity, a field procedure, or a validation procedure. In these cases, the column name in EBCDIC
cannot exceed 18 EBCDIC bytes in length, or the conversion of a column name from UNICODE to
EBCDIC failed.
BASE TABLESPACE IS LOG YES, LOB TABLESPACE IS LOG NO
A spatial index cannot be created because the following table spaces have the indicated attributes:
v The table space that contains base table has the LOG YES (or LOGGED) attribute.
v The LOB table space that stores the LOB column has the LOG NO (or NOT LOGGED) attribute.
CONTAINS A SPATIAL COLUMN
The LOG YES attribute of a LOB table space cannot be altered to LOG NO if an index depends on
the LOB column.
The LOG NO attribute of a table space cannot be altered to LOG YES if it contains a table with an
index that depends on a LOB column of the table.
6 The value of the PREVENT_NEW_IXCTRL_PART subsystem parameter disallowed the creation of
an index-controlled partitioned table.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the SQL statement for the object that is being created or altered.
SQLSTATE: 53092

-877 CCSID ASCII OR CCSID UNICODE IS NOT ALLOWED FOR THIS DATABASE OR TABLE SPACE
Explanation: The database or table space specified is required to be in EBCDIC.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Remove the CCSID ASCII or CCSID UNICODE clause from the statement.
SQLSTATE: 53093
-878 THE explain-object USED FOR EXPLAIN MUST BE ENCODED IN UNICODE. IT CANNOT BE IN ASCII OR EBCDIC.
Explanation: An EXPLAIN table object was encoded in the wrong format. It must be encoded in Unicode for use
with EXPLAIN.
explain-object
The name of the explain table object.
System action: The statement was not executed.
Programmer response: Migrate the current release format EXPLAIN tables to UNICODE for the current schema.
SQLSTATE: 53094
-879 CREATE or ALTER STATEMENT FOR object-name CANNOT DEFINE A COLUMN, DISTINCT TYPE, FUNCTION OR STORED PROCEDURE PARAMETER AS MIXED OR GRAPHIC WITH ENCODING SCHEME encoding-scheme
Explanation: A CREATE or ALTER TABLE statement for object-name attempted to define a column, distinct type, or
parameter of a user-defined function or stored procedure as mixed data or graphic when the system does not have
an appropriate CCSID defined for the encoding-scheme encoding scheme.
v A CREATE TYPE statement cannot define a distinct type, on EBCDIC or ASCII data, with a source type of
character FOR MIXED DATA, or GRAPHIC, VARGRAPHIC, or DBCLOB, when the MIXED DATA installation
option is set to NO.
v A CREATE FUNCTION or CREATE PROCEDURE statement cannot define a parameter or specify a RETURNS
data type, for ASCII or EBCDIC data, as character FOR MIXED DATA, GRAPHIC, VARGRAPHIC, or DBCLOB,
when the MIXED DATA installation option is set to NO.
This error occurs only when the encoding scheme that is in use is EBCDIC or ASCII. The MIXED DATA installation
option does not affect Unicode data.
This error can occur when a column or parameter is not explicitly defined with FOR MIXED DATA. This situation
occurs when the MIXED value in the application defaults module is YES. In this case, the default subtype for
character types is FOR MIXED DATA.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Contact your system administrator to properly set up the installation options, or change the
data types of the elements in columns in your CREATE or ALTER statement.
SQLSTATE: 53095
-880 SAVEPOINT savepoint-name DOES NOT EXIST OR IS INVALID IN THIS CONTEXT
Explanation: The RELEASE TO SAVEPOINT or ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT statement does not identify a
savepoint that exists.
System action: DB2 does not process the statement.
Programmer response: Correct the statement to use a valid savepoint name.
SQLSTATE: 3B001
-881 A SAVEPOINT WITH NAME savepoint-name ALREADY EXISTS, BUT THIS SAVEPOINT NAME CANNOT BE REUSED
Explanation: The SAVEPOINT statement uses the same savepoint name as another savepoint, and it cannot be
created because at least one of the savepoints was defined with the UNIQUE clause to indicate that the name cannot
be reused within the transaction.
System action: The statement is not executed and a new savepoint is not set. The old savepoint still exists.
Programmer response: Correct the statement. Either use a different savepoint name, or omit the UNIQUE clause if
the other savepoint was created without the UNIQUE clause and your intention is to reuse that savepoint name.
SQLSTATE: 3B501
-882 SAVEPOINT DOES NOT EXIST
Explanation: A ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT statement was specified without a savepoint name to rollback to the
last active savepoint, but no savepoint exists.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the application logic to either set a savepoint or to not attempt to rollback to a
savepoint.
SQLSTATE: 3B502
-900 THE SQL STATEMENT CANNOT BE EXECUTED BECAUSE THE APPLICATION PROCESS IS NOT CONNECTED TO A SERVER
Explanation: A previous failure has placed the application process in the unconnected state. An unsuccessful request
to switch the user in a trusted connection can cause the connection to go into an unconnected state. The only SQL
statements that can be successfully executed from the unconnected state are CONNECT, COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and
local SET statements.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: It is possible that no response is required because checking for -900 is one way of detecting
the unconnected state. If this error is the result of another situation, the logic of the application program must be
changed.

-901 UNSUCCESSFUL EXECUTION CAUSED BY A SYSTEM ERROR THAT DOES NOT PRECLUDE THE SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF SUBSEQUENT SQL STATEMENTS
Explanation: A system error occurred that prevented successful execution of the current SQL statement.
Multiple forms: This message has two forms. The form that is shown above applies if the SQL statement is not a
query that was sent to an accelerator server. The following form applies if the SQL statement is a query that was sent
to an accelerator server: UNSUCCESSFUL EXECUTION CAUSED BY A SYSTEM ERROR THAT DOES NOT
PRECLUDE THE SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF SUBSEQUENT SQL STATEMENTS accelerator-info
accelerator-info
An error message that was returned by the accelerator server.
If the SQL statement is not a query that was sent to an accelerator server, possible causes for this error include:
v Statement length: The length of the SQL statement is either less than 0 or greater than the permitted maximum
length for a statement.
v Distributed commit processing: Distributed commit processing encountered an error. All servers in the unit of
work that support distributed two-phase commit back out the unit of work. If a server that does not support
distributed two-phase commit has updates in the unit of work, that server must be queried to determine if its
updates were committed or backed out.
v Incomplete post-processing work: The transaction is aborted and commit failed. Typical causes for incomplete
post-processing include:
¨C An update that changes the partition of a row
¨C Resource availability
¨C The existence of held cursors
¨C Violations of uniqueness constraints
If the SQL statement is a query that was sent to an accelerator server, the error is returned because the accelerator
server could not execute the query.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. A X'04E' abend might be requested for the application. The
application program can have a recovery routine to recover from such an abend and can retry SQL statements.
The error does not prevent successful execution of further SQL statements.
Programmer response: If an abend occurred, notify the system programmer for analysis of the abend that caused
this return code. Even if an abend occurred, an application program receiving this return code can retry and is not
prohibited from executing further SQL statements.
If the error occurred during a commit, examine any detailed resource unavailable information that is posted to the
system operator console or in the DB2 ssnmMSTR address space job log to determine if a resource unavailable
problem prevented commit post-processing from completing.
If the error occurred for a query that was sent to an accelerator server, check whether the SQL statement contains a
logical error. An example of a logical error in an SQL statement is a division operation that results in division by 0. If
you determine that your application is not the source of the error, contact IBM Software Support, and provide the
value in the accelerator-info token.

-902 POINTER TO THE ESSENTIAL CONTROL BLOCK (CT/RDA) HAS VALUE 0, REBIND REQUIRED
Explanation: Pointer to the essential control block, either the CT or the RDA, is zeros. This precludes the successful
execution of the current SQL statement, as well as any subsequent SQL statements.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The application program is not permitted to issue additional
SQL statements. For example, a recovery routine associated with the application program may not issue additional
SQL statements.
Programmer response: Rebind the failing application program and try again. If the problem persists, examine your
DBRM and make sure it matches your program.
SQLSTATE: 58005
-904 UNSUCCESSFUL EXECUTION CAUSED BY AN UNAVAILABLE RESOURCE. REASON reason-code, TYPE OF RESOURCE resource-type, AND RESOURCE NAME resource-name
Explanation: The SQL statement could not be executed because a required resource was not available.
reason-code
A numeric value that indicates the reason for the failure.
resource-type
The type of resource.
resource-name
The name of the resource that was not available.
When resource-type is 402, the value of resource-name is the z/OS Security Server return and reason codes for
the unavailable resource.
System action: The SQL statement cannot be processed.
If the SQL statement being processed was a cursor FETCH, DB2 closes the cursor. Subsequent attempts to use that
cursor without first opening it receive an SQLCODE -501.
Programmer response: Verify the identity of the resource that was not available. To determine why the resource was
unavailable, refer to the specified reason-code.
If resource-name identifies the optimum buffer pool, either define the buffer pool with that name or create the table in
a table space that is defined with that buffer pool.

-905 UNSUCCESSFUL EXECUTION DUE TO RESOURCE LIMIT BEING EXCEEDED, RESOURCE NAME = resource-name LIMIT = limit-amount1 CPU SECONDS (limit-amount2 SERVICE UNITS) DERIVED FROM limit-source
Explanation: The execution of the SQL statement was terminated because a resource limit was exceeded.
resource-name
The name of the resource whose limit was exceeded. It is also the name of the column in the DB2 table from
which the limit was derived. The resource-name can be ASUTIME, which is the number of CPU seconds
permitted for each SQL statement.
limit-amount1
The maximum number of CPU seconds permitted
limit-amount2
The maximum number in service units permitted
limit-source
The source used to derive the limit-amount: the name of a resource limit specification table, a system
parameter, or the SYSIBM.SYSROUTINES catalog table. If the source is a system parameter, the resource
limit specification table did not contain an applicable entry or an error occurred while accessing the table.
System action: If the limit-source was a resource limit specification table or a system parameter, the execution of this
SQL statement is terminated.
In the case of a routine exceeded ASUTIME threshold, the current transaction is rolled back to the previous commit
point. The thread is placed into a must rollback state, and no SQL statements can be processed before a ROLLBACK
is issued.
A trace record containing more detailed information about this failure is generated. If an SQL cursor is associated
with the failed instruction, its position is unchanged and a CLOSE or PREPARE statement can be issued. If any other
operation is attempted with the cursor, it cannot be executed and SQLCODE -905 is returned. If there is no cursor,
this statement was rolled back.
Programmer response: Determine why this SQL statement or stored procedure took so long and take appropriate
action. Consider simplifying the SQL statement, restructuring tables and indexes, or contacting the installation group
responsible for maintaining the resource limit specification tables.
If the limit-source was a resource limit specification table or a system parameter, the application program that receives
this return code can execute additional SQL statements.
If SQLCODE -905 is issued in response to a dynamic statement that is monitored by the resource limit facility and
that is inside a routine, increase the ASUTIME value that is specified for the top-level calling package in the resource
limit table. The limit specified for the top-level calling package is applied for the entire thread.

-906 THE SQL STATEMENT CANNOT BE EXECUTED BECAUSE THIS FUNCTION IS DISABLED DUE TO A PRIOR ERROR
Explanation: Execution of the SQL statement failed because the requested function had been disabled by a prior
error. This situation can arise if the application program has intercepted an abend (for instance, by an ON ERROR
condition in a PL/I program) and continued to execute SQL statements. This situation may also arise if a DB2 CICS
transaction encountered a create thread error yet continued to issue SQL requests without issuing a SYNCPOINT
ROLLBACK first.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: In general, an application program should terminate upon receipt of this return code. All
subsequent attempts by the application to execute other SQL statements will also fail with the same return code. In
the case of a DB2 CICS transaction, if the SQLERRP field in the SQLCA contains the module name DSNCEXT1, the
transaction may issue a SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK and continue processing. If the transactions chooses to
ROLLBACK and continue processing, it must be capable of correcting the situation that caused the create thread
error to occur originally.

Explanation: For BIND and REBIND, the indicated authorization ID is not allowed to perform the indicated
bind-type against a plan or package. An entry in the resource limit specification table (RLST) prohibits binding and
rebinding by this authorization ID, or all authorization IDs. For AUTO-REBIND, the system parameter controlling
AUTO-REBIND operations is set to disallow AUTO-REBIND.
bind-type
Type of bind operation (BIND, REBIND or AUTO-REBIND).
auth-id Authorization ID of the invoker of the BIND subcommand or primary authorization ID of the invoker of the
plan for AUTO-REBIND operations.
System action: The plan or package is not bound.
System programmer response: If the indicated authorization id should be allowed to bind, change the entry in the
active RLST table. If AUTO-REBIND operations are disabled, rebind the package before reexecuting the package.
SQLSTATE: 23510
-909 THE OBJECT HAS BEEN DELETED OR ALTERED
Explanation: The application program has performed one of the following actions:
v Dropped or altered a table and then accessed it.
v Dropped or altered an index and then accessed the table on which the index was defined.
v Executed the EXCHANGE statement on a table more than once without executing a COMMIT statement between
consecutive EXCHANGE statements.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
System programmer response: Correct the application program in one of the following ways:
v Do not drop or alter a table, and then access it in the same application program.
v Do not drop or alter an index, and then access the table on which it is defined in the same application program.
v If the application program contains consecutive EXCHANGE statements for a table, include a COMMIT statement
between the EXCHANGE statements.
SQLSTATE: 57007
-910 THE SQL STATEMENT CANNOT ACCESS AN OBJECT ON WHICH UNCOMMITTED CHANGES ARE PENDING
Explanation: The application program attempted to access an object that has been modified and the changes have
not yet been committed. This error is issued in the following situations:
v When an application program issues a data definitional statement (DROP, ALTER, CREATE, or RENAME) against
an object, and then attempts to access that object before the operation is complete.
v When the application program issues an ALTER or CREATE statement, and a data manipulative statement (such
as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, or SELECT) is processed for the same object, in the same commit scope.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Modify the logic of the application program, other than the logic for DROP, so that a
COMMIT (or the IMS or CICS equivalent) is executed between the data definitional statement and the failing SQL
statement, or between the data manipulative statement and the data definitional statement. In cases where open held
cursors are associated with the failing SQL statement, the cursor must be closed prior to COMMIT.
For DROP, the logic of the application program should be modified so that no attempt is made to access an object
after the DROP has been executed. Attention: DROP includes cases when rollback to a savepoint includes rolling
back to a CREATE.
SQLSTATE: 57007
-911 THE CURRENT UNIT OF WORK HAS BEEN ROLLED BACK DUE TO DEADLOCK OR TIMEOUT. REASON reason-code, TYPE OF RESOURCE resource-type, AND RESOURCE NAME resource-name
Explanation: The current unit of work was the victim in a deadlock, or experienced a timeout, and had to be rolled
back.
The reason code indicated whether a deadlock or timeout occurred. For an explanation of resource type codes, see
Appendix F, ¡°Resource types,¡± on page 1289.
Attention: The changes associated with the unit of work must be entered again.
SQLERRD(3) also contains the reason-code which indicates whether a deadlock or timeout occurred. The most
common reason codes are:
v 00C90088 - deadlock
v 00C9008E - timeout
The changes associated with the unit of work must be entered again.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The application is rolled back to the previous COMMIT.
Programmer response: A long-running application, or an application that is likely to encounter a deadlock, should
(if possible) issue frequent COMMIT commands. This can lessen the possibility of a deadlock occurring. See message
DSNT376I for other possible ways to avoid future deadlocks or timeouts. On receipt of the SQLCODE -911, the
application should, in general, terminate.

Explanation: The application was the victim in a deadlock or experienced a timeout. The reason code indicates
whether a deadlock or timeout occurred.
For an explanation of resource type codes, see Appendix F, ¡°Resource types,¡± on page 1289.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. If the SQL statement being executed was a cursor FETCH, DB2
closes the cursor.
SQLERRD(3) also contains the reason-code which indicates whether a deadlock or timeout occurred. The most
common reason codes are:
v 00C90088 - deadlock
v 00C9008E - timeout
Programmer response: The application should either commit or roll back to the previous COMMIT. Then, generally,
the application should terminate. See message DSNT376I for possible ways to avoid future deadlocks or timeouts.

-917 BIND PACKAGE FAILED
Explanation: An error has occurred which prevents the package from being created. This SQLCODE can be issued
during bind or commit processing.
System action: The bind fails and the package is not created. If issued during commit processing, all changes to the
database are rolled back. If issued during bind processing, only package creation fails. Other changes within the
logical unit of work are committable.
Programmer response: Correct the cause of the problem and try again.
Problem determination: Inspect the SQLCODES issued for the SQL statements of the package.
SQLSTATE: 42969
-918 THE SQL STATEMENT CANNOT BE EXECUTED BECAUSE A CONNECTION HAS BEEN LOST
Explanation: Execution of the SQL statement failed because a communications link between the local DB2 and at
least one remote server no longer exists. A previous failure caused this condition.
System action: In the IMS and CICS environments, all SQL statements are rejected until the rollback occurs. In the
other environments, all SQL statements other than a static ROLLBACK are rejected until a static ROLLBACK is
executed.
Programmer response: In general, an application program should issue a static ROLLBACK. Attempts by the
application to issue SQL statements other than static ROLLBACK might fail. Once the static ROLLBACK is issued,
the application can resume execution.
SQLERRP contains the name of the module that detected the previous failure and placed the application in the
must-abort state.
SQLSTATE: 51021
-919 A ROLLBACK OPERATION IS REQUIRED
Explanation: The unit of work was placed in a state where a rollback operation is required. This can happen for the
following reasons:
v An SQL statement updated a distributed database server, but the database server can be used only for read-only
operations. Either updates are currently restricted to servers that support distributed two-phase commit and this
application server does not support distributed two-phase commit, or updates are restricted to a single server that
does not support distributed two-phase commit and this application server is not that server.
The unit of work must be terminated by a rollback operation because the update made (but not committed) at the
application server cannot be committed consistently with other current or future updates made to this distributed
unit of work.
v An abend occurred during the execution of a stored procedure, or a restricted SQL statement was issued from a
stored procedure.
v An abend occurred during the execution of a function, or a restricted SQL statement was issued from a function.
v The unit of work is part of a Global Transaction, and another unit of work in the Global Transaction has initiated a
ROLLBACK. All units of work in the Global Transaction must now ROLLBACK.
System action: In the IMS and CICS environments, all SQL statements are rejected until the rollback occurs. In the
other environments, all SQL statements other than a static ROLLBACK are rejected until a static ROLLBACK is
executed.
Programmer response: Correct the application, function, or stored procedure, rebind it, and resubmit the job.
SQLERRP contains the name of the module that detected the previous failure and placed the application in the
must-abort state.
SQLSTATE: 56045
-922 AUTHORIZATION FAILURE: error-type ERROR. REASON reason-code
Explanation: Authorization failed because of the error indicated by error-type
error-type
The types of authorization failure:
v User authorization
v Plan access
v Duplicate exit requested
v Installation error
v Connect
reason-code
The DB2 reason code associated with authorization failure
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The connection to DB2 is not established.
Programmer response: If error-type is 'USER AUTHORIZATION', the authorization-ID specified to DB2 through
your attachment facility is not valid for DB2. Contact the system programmer or your CICS, IMS, or TSO system
administrator.
If error-type is 'PLAN ACCESS', then the authorization ID associated with this connection is not authorized to use the
specified plan name or the specified plan name does not exist. See your system administrator.
If error-type is 'DUPLICATE EXIT', then you requested a duplicate exit.
If error-type is 'INSTALLATION ERROR', a connection or sign-on exit denied your request. See your system
programmer.
If error-type is 'CONNECT', an SQL CONNECT request failed to connect to the local DB2 with USER/USING
specified. See the reason code for a description of the failure. The application program has been placed in the
connectable and unconnected state. The only SQL statements that can be successfully completed in this state are
CONNECT, COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and local SET statements. Any attempt to execute other SQL statements will
result in an error (SQLCODE -900).
Any attempts to issue SQL statements following the -922 SQLCODE when error-type is not Connect cause
unpredictable results.

-923 CONNECTION NOT ESTABLISHED: DB2 condition REASON reason-code, TYPE resource-type, NAME resource-name
Explanation: The connection to DB2 failed for the reason indicated by condition, which can be any of the following:
v DB2 not up
v DB2 not operational
v DB2 shutdown in progress
v DB2 restricted access mode
v Allocation error
v DB2 - CICS attachment not up
v DB2 - CICS ENTRY disabled
v The object is dependent on facilities of a release of DB2 that is newer than the release that you are currently
running (fall back).
v DB2 restarted in light mode
Possible causes of an allocation error are:
v The application plan does not exist.
v A required database, table space, table, or index is unavailable.
v Data set allocation failed for a required data set.
v There is insufficient virtual storage.
v The application is trying to execute the plan from a system (environment) that was restricted when the plan was
bound or rebound. Check the SYSPLSYSTEM table to determine from which systems (for example, IMS or CICS)
the plan can be executed.
If the condition is "CICS attachment not up", then NAME indicates the DB2 subsystem that is not available. The reason
code indicates the reason the attachment is not available.
If the condition is "CICS entry disabled", then NAME indicates the entry that is disabled.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The connection to DB2 is not established.
Programmer response: If the connection failed because either DB2 or a required database, table space, table, or
index was unavailable, wait until it is available before invoking the application again.
If allocation failed for an application plan, REBIND the plan to determine the problem. Error messages are produced
explaining why the plan could not be allocated.
For other types of allocation errors, installation action might be required to correct the problem.
For CICS attachment failures, resolve the primary cause as noted by the reason code. Then restart the attachment.
Problem determination: The reason-code, resource-type, and resource-name might not be available. If they are not
available, nothing appears.
Refer to Appendix F, ¡°Resource types,¡± on page 1289 for an explanation of resource type codes. Any attempts to issue
SQL statements after receiving SQLCODE -923 will cause unpredictable results.

Explanation: Connection to DB2 has failed because of an unexpected internal error, identified by the reason-code
value.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The connection to DB2 is not established.
Programmer response: The requested function-code and return-code values might provide additional information. Any
attempts to issue SQL statements after the SQLCODE -924 might have unpredictable results.

-925 COMMIT NOT VALID IN IMS, CICS OR RRSAF ENVIRONMENT
Explanation: An application executing in either an IMS or CICS environment or an application executing in an
RRSAF environment when DB2 is not the only resource manager has attempted to execute a COMMIT statement.
The SQL COMMIT statement cannot be executed in these environments.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No commit is performed.
Programmer response: The IMS, CICS or RRS protocols should be used to commit work in these environments.
If a stored procedure is being called from IMS or CICS, ensure that the stored procedure is not defined to perform a
commit on return.
SQLSTATE: 2D521
-926 ROLLBACK NOT VALID IN IMS, CICS OR RRSAF ENVIRONMENT
Explanation: An application executing in either an IMS or CICS environment or an application executing in an
RRSAF environment when DB2 is not the only resource manager has attempted to execute a ROLLBACK statement.
The SQL ROLLBACK statement cannot be executed in these environments.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No rollback is performed.
Programmer response: The IMS, CICS or RRS protocols should be used to roll back work in these environments.
SQLSTATE: 2D521
-927 THE LANGUAGE INTERFACE (LI) WAS CALLED WHEN THE CONNECTING ENVIRONMENT WAS NOT ESTABLISHED. THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE INVOKED UNDER THE DSN COMMAND
Explanation: In the TSO environment, the user has attempted to execute an application program without first
establishing the correct execution environment by issuing the DSN command. In the IMS, CICS, RRSAF, or call
attachment facility (CAF) environment, the user has attempted to execute an application program that is not using
the correct language interface module.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: In the TSO environment, DB2 application programs should be invoked under the RUN
subcommand of the DSN command processor. In the IMS, CICS, RRSAF, or CAF environment check that the
application was link-edited with or is dynamically allocating the correct language interface module. The language
interface modules required in each environment are as follows:
v TSO: DSNELI
v IMS: DFSLI000
v CICS: DSNCLI
v RRSAF: DSNRLI
v CAF: DSNALI
The DYNAM option can result in the incorrect language interface module being loaded at run time.
SQLSTATE: 51006
-929 FAILURE IN A DATA CAPTURE EXIT: token
Explanation: 'token' is an information string provided by DPROP's exit routine which captures data changes in
tables defined with DATA CAPTURE CHANGES.
System action: The information string is placed in in the SQLERRM area of the SQLCA.
System programmer response: For documentation of the actions associated with this SQLCODE, refer to the Data
Propagator (DPROP) publications.
SQLSTATE: 58002
-939 ROLLBACK REQUIRED DUE TO UNREQUESTED ROLLBACK OF A REMOTE SERVER
Explanation: A dynamic commit was executed preceding the execution of this request. The remote server to which
the application was CONNECTed during the dynamic COMMIT successfully committed. However, at least one other
remote server (which was read-only) rolled back its portion of the distributed unit of work during the dynamic
commit.
To ensure that an application that uses cursor-hold cursors does not incorrectly assume cursor position is being
maintained at any remote server that rolled back, the application must perform a rollback operation.
Communications are still established with all remote servers.
System action: In the IMS and CICS environments, all SQL statements are rejected until the rollback occurs. In the
other environments, all SQL statements other than a static ROLLBACK are rejected until a static ROLLBACK is
executed.
Programmer response: Issue the appropriate (depending on the environment) request to cause a rollback.
Re-establish any cursor positioning and continue the application with the first request that received the -939
SQLCODE.
SQLERRP contains the name of the module that detected the previous failure and placed the application in the
must-abort state.
SQLSTATE: 51021
-947 THE SQL STATEMENT FAILED BECAUSE IT WILL CHANGE A TABLE DEFINED WITH DATA CAPTURE CHANGES, BUT THE DATA CANNOT BE PROPAGATED
Explanation: The DPROP SUPPORT option on the installation panel is set to 2 (support DPROP only). The SQL
statement would have changed a table defined with DATA CAPTURE CHANGES. However, the data cannot be
propagated because the SQL statement did not originate from an IMS subsystem, or monitor trace class 6 was not
active at the beginning of the unit of work for that change.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
System programmer response: Take one of the following actions:
v Change the installation option to 1 (no propagation) or 3 (permit changes from any subsystem).
v Change the application program that receives this SQLCODE so that it can be run in an IMS subsystem, and
activate monitor trace class 6.
If the installation option is changed to 3, SQL changes to tables defined with DATA CAPTURE CHANGES are
permitted from any subsystem, but they are not propagated unless the environment is set up for propagation.
SQLSTATE: 56038
-948 DISTRIBUTED OPERATION IS INVALID
Explanation: The unit of work was initiated before DDF was started, and the application attempted to perform a
distributed operation. The unit of work must be terminated by a rollback operation.
System action: In the IMS and CICS environments, all SQL statements are rejected until a rollback occurs. In the
other environments, all SQL statements other than a static ROLLBACK are rejected until a static ROLLBACK is
executed.
Programmer response: An application that performs local database updates before DDF is started cannot perform
distributed operations within the same unit of work. The current unit of work must be terminated by a rollback
operation and a new unit of work must be initiated before any SQL operations can be performed.
Restart the current unit of work.
SQLSTATE: 56062
-950 THE LOCATION NAME SPECIFIED IN THE CONNECT STATEMENT IS INVALID OR NOT LISTED IN THE COMMUNICATIONS DATABASE
Explanation: One of the following conditions applies:
v The location name is blank.
v The data type of the host variable is not character string.
v The length attribute of the host variable is greater than 16.
v The location name does not appear in the LOCATIONS column of the SYSIBM.LOCATIONS table, nor is it the
name of the local DB2 subsystem.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The application process is placed in the unconnected state.
Programmer response: If the location name is specified as the value of a host variable, ensure that the name is left
justified in the host variable and, if necessary, padded on the right with blanks. If this is not the problem, either
SYSIBM.LOCATIONS must be updated to include the specified name, or the specified name must be changed to
match a name in SYSIBM.LOCATIONS.
SQLSTATE: 42705
-951 OBJECT object-name OBJECT TYPE object-type IS IN USE AND CANNOT BE THE TARGET OF THE SPECIFIED ALTER STATEMENT
Explanation: The options for the SQL routine cannot be altered if the version of the routine is currently active under
the same thread that issued the ALTER statement, and one or more of the options that is being altered result in the
rebinding or regeneration of the package for the SQL routine.
object-name
The name of the object.
object-type
The type of object.
If the failing statement was either ALTER PROCEDURE ACTIVATE VERSION or ALTER FUNCTION ACTIVATE
VERSION, the active version of a currently active SQL routine under nested routine invocation by the same thread
cannot be changed.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Review the information about altering routine options and which alterations result in the
rebinding or regeneration of associated packages.
Verify that the logic for nested routine invocation involving SQL routines and the ALTER statements are working as
intended. Pay additional attention to CALL :HV statements with the setting of special register CURRENT ROUTINE
VERSION, as the combination of these statements can produce unwanted logic flows. If it is necessary to use
multiple versions of the same SQL routine in the nested recursive chain, consider using CALL :HV and the special
register CURRENT ROUTINE VERSION to control which version is used, instead of the ALTER ACTIVATE
VERSION clause.

-952 PROCESSING WAS INTERRUPTED BY A CANCEL REQUEST FROM A CLIENT PROGRAM
Explanation: A client program issued a cancel request that terminated processing of the SQL statement.
System action: The SQL statement was terminated and any changes made by that statement have been undone. If
an SQL cursor is associated with the interrupted SQL statement, that cursor is closed.
SQLSTATE: 57014
-981 THE SQL STATEMENT FAILED BECAUSE THE RRSAF CONNECTION IS NOT IN A STATE THAT ALLOWS SQL OPERATIONS, REASON reason-code.
Explanation: The application attempted to execute an SQL operation, but the RRSAF connection was not in a state
that allows the processing of SQL statements.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the error in the application, REBIND, and run the application again.

-989 AFTER TRIGGER trigger-name ATTEMPTED TO MODIFY A ROW IN TABLE table-name THAT WAS MODIFIED BY AN SQL DATA CHANGE STATEMENT WITHIN A FROM CLAUSE
Explanation: An SQL data change statement was specified in the FROM clause where FINAL TABLE was specified,
but the underlying target base table of the SQL data change statement has an AFTER trigger defined which modifies
the same table. This is disallowed.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Avoid using the SQL data change statement within a FROM clause, or change the trigger so
that it does not modify the table that is the target of the SQL data change statement.
SQLSTATE:: 57058
-991 CALL ATTACH WAS UNABLE TO ESTABLISH AN IMPLICIT CONNECT OR OPEN TO DB2.  RC1= rc1 RC2= rc2
Explanation: Call attach attempted to perform an implicit connect and open as the result of an SQL statement. The
connect or open failed with the returned values.
rc1 The value returned in FRBRC1 for the failed CONNECT or OPEN request.
rc2 The value returned in FRBRC2 for the failed CONNECT or OPEN request.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Verify that the application intended to use the call attachment facility (CAF) as the
mechanism to connect to DB2. For functions or stored procedures running in the WLM-established stored procedure
address space the application must be link-edited with or dynamically allocate the RRS attachment language interface
module (DSNRLI), not CAF.
SQLSTATE: 57015
-992 PACKAGE package-name CANNOT BE EXECUTED OR DEPLOYED ON LOCATION location-name
Explanation: A mismatch in DB2 code levels prevents the package from being executed or deployed.
package-name
The name of the package.
location-name
The DB2 system where the deployment or execution was attempted.
One of the following conditions has occurred:
v The package cannot be executed or deployed because of a mismatch in the level of the DB2 code between the
system identified by location-name and the current server. The current server and the system identified by
location-name might be the same system.
v The representation of an SQL routine cannot be executed on the system. The package was bound at a different
release or maintenance level than the system can support.
Deployment is the process of establishing an SQL routine at a remote location without regenerating the
representation of that routine. The deployment requires that the remote server be able to understand the structures
generated by the current server for the identified package. The difference in code level between the current server
and the remote location makes this impossible. The difference might be in release levels or maintenance levels, but it
is large enough that the package cannot be deployed from the current server to the remote location.
This condition might be specific to this particular package. Other packages might successfully be executed on this
system or deployed from the current server to the remote location.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If this condition occurs when deploying a SQL routine, try again after DB2 at location-name is
updated to the release or maintenance level that can support the package that is being deployed.
If this condition occurs in contexts other than deployment (for example, a package that was created prior to
application of a PTF is no longer supported by the level of DB2 after the application of that PTF), then execute the
ALTER PROCEDURE or ALTER FUNCTION statement with the REGENERATE clause for that version of the SQL
routine at the current server to regenerate the package using the current maintenance level. The ALTER PROCEDURE
or ALTER FUNCTION statement with the REGENERATE clause will cause a rebind of the package at the local
server.
If the SQL routine required package replication at different servers, the process must be repeated for the regenerated
SQL routine.
If variations of the package have been created locally with different collection IDs, those additional packages should
also be explicitly rebound.
SQLSTATE: 51008
-1403 THE USERNAME AND/OR PASSWORD SUPPLIED IS INCORRECT
Explanation: The username and/or password supplied is incorrect. If either a username or password is supplied,
then both must be supplied and both must have a non-zero length.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Supply the correct username and password combination.
SQLSTATE: 08004
-1760 CREATE PROCEDURE FOR procedure-name MUST HAVE VALID LANGUAGE AND EXTERNAL CLAUSES
Explanation: A LANGUAGE or EXTERNAL clause is missing in the CREATE statement for procedure
procedure-name. This clause must be specified.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the CREATE statement to include the missing clause and reissue the statement.
SQLSTATE: 42601
-2001 THE NUMBER OF HOST VARIABLE PARAMETERS FOR A STORED PROCEDURE IS NOT EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF EXPECTED HOST VARIABLE PARAMETERS. ACTUAL NUMBER sqldanum, EXPECTED NUMBER opnum
Explanation: DB2 received an SQL CALL statement for a stored procedure. However, the number of host variable
parameters supplied on the CALL statement does not match the expected number of host variable parameters.
sqldanum
The number of host variable parameters as determined by examining the SQLDA.
opnum The expected number of host variable parameters as determined by parsing the statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If the SQL CALL statement is coded incorrectly, modify the SQL application to provide the
correct number of parameters on the SQL CALL statement.
SQLSTATE: 53089
-4302 JAVA STORED PROCEDURE OR USER-DEFINED FUNCTION routine-name (SPECIFIC NAME specific-name) HAS EXITED WITH AN EXCEPTION exception-string
Explanation: User-defined function or stored procedure routine-name exited with a Java exception that was not a
java.sql.SQLException.
If present, exception-string contains as much as will fit of the toString() of the exception that was uncaught.
System action: Execution of the SQL statement is terminated.
Programmer response: The user-defined function or stored procedure probably needs to be corrected. See your
database administrator, or the author of the routine to find out if the exception can be avoided, or if the user-defined
function or stored procedure needs to be fixed before it can be used.
SQLSTATE: 38000
-4700 ATTEMPT TO USE NEW FUNCTION BEFORE NEW FUNCTION MODE
Explanation: Functions that this release of DB2 introduces cannot be used before new function mode has been
enabled. An attempt was made to execute one of these functions.
To use the new functions that have been introduced in this release of DB2, new-function mode must first be enabled.
This error code will be given after an attempt to use a new function before new-function mode has been enabled.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Either delay running your program until new-function mode has been enabled, or restrict
your program to functions that are supported before new-function mode is enabled.

Explanation: The intended operation would exceed permitted limits.
v If an ALTER TABLE or CREATE INDEX statement was used to change or create limit keys, the length of the
partitioning limit key exceeds the allowed maximum.
v If an ALTER TABLE statement was used to add partitions, the maximum number of partitions already exist.
v If an ALTER TABLE statement was used to add partitions to the table space, the total number of table space
partitions exceeded the number of partitions that are specified on the MAXPARTITIONS clause for
partition-by-growth table spaces.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the problem and reissue the statement.
Adding or changing limit keys
Decrease the size of limit key or the number of table space partitions to satisfy the constraint.
Adding partitions
For non-large table spaces, the limit is 8, 16, 32, or 64, depending on the initial definition. For large table
spaces, see the information about limits in DB2 for z/OS.
Adding partitions to a partition-by-growth table space
Increase the number of table space partitions by increasing the value of MAXPARTITIONS to satisfy the
constraint.

The type of routine: procedure or function.
The valid options vary by routine type:
PROCEDURE
The options that can be specified when altering an SQL procedure depend on the type of the SQL procedure
being changed. Two types of SQL procedures exist: native SQL procedures and external SQL procedures.
FUNCTION
The options that can be specified when altering an SQL scalar function depend on whether the SQL function
is an inlined function or a compiled function.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Review the appropriate ALTER statement to determine which options can be changed for the
specified object, correct the syntax, and reissue the statement.

-4706 ALTER STATEMENT FOR AN SQL ROUTINE CANNOT BE PROCESSED BECAUSE THE OPTIONS CURRENTLY IN EFFECT (ENVID current-envid) ARE NOT THE SAME AS THE ONES THAT WERE IN EFFECT (ENVID defined-envid) WHEN THE ROUTINE OR VERSION WAS FIRST DEFINED
Explanation: The ALTER statement attempted to alter a version of a routine when the environment settings in effect
at the time of the ALTER statement were not the same as when the version of the routine was first defined.
current-envid
The environment settings that are in effect at the time of the ALTER statement.
defined-envid
The environment settings that were in effect when the routine was first defined.
To alter a version of a routine, the environment settings that are in effect when the ALTER PROCEDURE or ALTER
FUNCTION statement is issued must be the same as the environment settings that were in effect when the version of
the routine was first defined (either with a CREATE or ALTER statement for the SQL routine) if any of the following
options are specified as part of the statement's option-list clause:
v QUALIFIER
v PACKAGE OWNER
v WLM ENVIRONMENT FOR DEBUG MODE
v OPTHINT
v SQL PATH
v DECIMAL if the value includes a comma
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Specify the name of a routine that was created with the same environment settings in effect as the
current settings, or do not specify the options named above.

-4732 THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ALTERS ALLOWED HAS BEEN EXCEEDED FOR object-type
Explanation: The ALTER statement cannot be processed because the maximum number of alters for the object has
already been exceeded. This can occur for the following reasons:
v The SET DATA TYPE keyword was specified on an ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN statement, but the maximum
number of ALTER statements for this table has already been reached.
v The statement attempts to alter an index, but the maximum number of ALTER statements for this index has
already been reached.

-4733 THE ALTER TABLE STATEMENT CANNOT BE EXECUTED BECAUSE COLUMN column-name IS MIXED DATA, OR THE DATA TYPE OR LENGTH SPECIFIED DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE EXISTING DATA TYPE OR LENGTH
Explanation: The ALTER TABLE statement for column column-name could not be processed for one of the following
reasons:
v the existing column is MIXED and the statement attempted to convert the column to SBCS. This conversion is not
supported.
v the data type or length in the ALTER statement did not match the existing data type or length of the column in the
table being altered.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the SQL statement to specify a conversion that is supported.

-4734 THE LOAD MODULE FOR THE PROCEDURE ASSUMES A PARAMETER VARCHAR OPTION THAT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE OPTION SPECIFIED ON THE CREATE PROCEDURE STATEMENT FOR procedure-name
Explanation: The C load module for the SQL procedure was built assuming a PARAMETER VARCHAR option that
is not the same as what was specified on the CREATE PROCEDURE statement for the procedure.
procedure-name
The name of the SQL procedure.
The PARAMETER VARCHAR option assumed when the load module for the procedure is created should be the
same as the one that is specified when the procedure is defined to DB2. The consequences of a mismatch include
errors at execution time, and invalid data output with no error to indicate that a problem exists.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Rebuild the procedure so that the options match.
SQLSTATE: 560CU
-4735 INVALID TABLE REFERENCE FOR TABLE LOCATOR
Explanation: At execution time, an SQL statement in the body of a routine has a table-locator-reference in the FROM
clause to reference a transition table of the trigger invoking the routine. For example:
TABLE (table-locator-var LIKE table-name)
SQLCODE -4735 is issued when the definition of the table that follows the LIKE keyword is different than the
definition of the table specified for the table locator parameter on the CREATE PROCEDURE or CREATE
FUNCTION statement for the routine.
The use of TABLE LIKE syntax provides an implicit definition of the transition table. It specifies that the transition
table has the same number of columns as the identified table or view. The columns must have the same data type,
length, precision, scale, subtype, and encoding scheme as the identified table or view, as described in catalog tables
SYSCOLUMNS and SYSTABLESPACES. The number of columns and the attributes of those columns are determined
at the time the CREATE PROCEDURE or CREATE FUNCTION statement is processed. Any subsequent changes to
the number of columns in the table or the attributes of those columns does not affect the parameters of the routine.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the table name in the table locator reference to the name of a table that has the same
definition as the table name used on the CREATE PROCEDURE or CREATE FUNCTION statement for the table
locator parameter.

-4736 A PERIOD SPECIFICATION OR PERIOD CLAUSE IS NOT SUPPORTED AS SPECIFIED FOR OBJECT object-name. REASON CODE = reason-code.
Explanation: A period specification or period clause is not valid as specified.
object-name
The name of the object.
reason-code
A numeric value that indicates why the period specification or period clause is invalid:
1 In a CREATE FUNCTION statement for object-name, the definition of the function contains a period
specification that is not supported. The routine body of an SQL scalar function must not contain a
period specification or period clause. A RETURN statement in a table function must not contain a
period specification.
2 In a CREATE VIEW statement for object-name, a fullselect must not contain a period specification.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Either remove the period specification or period clause, or change the statement to reference a
different object.
SQLSTATE: 560CY

-4738 TABLE table-name CANNOT BE DEFINED AS SPECIFIED IN THE statement STATEMENT IN A COMMON CRITERIA ENVIRONMENT
Explanation: A CREATE, DECLARE, or ALTER statement attempted to define a new table or change an existing
table in a Common Criteria environment, but the specification is not valid for one of the following reasons:
v A CREATE TABLE statement included an explicit list of column definitions, but did not include a security label
column. In a Common Criteria environment each table must be defined with a security label column.
v A CREATE TABLE statement included a LIKE clause or AS FULLSELECT clause with the WITH NO DATA clause,
to define a new base table. The LIKE clause and AS FULLSELECT fullselect clauses are not supported in a
Common Criteria environment.
v A CREATE TABLE statement included an AS fullselect clause to define a materialized query table, and the WITH
NO DATA clause was not specified. Materialized query tables are not supported in a Common Criteria
environment.
v A DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE statement included a LIKE clause, or AS FULLSELECT clause with
the WITH NO DATA clause to define a new temporary table. The LIKE clause and AS FULLSELECT clauses are
not supported in a Common Criteria environment.
v An ALTER TABLE statement attempted to change a table to a materialized query table. Materialized query tables
are not supported in a Common Criteria environment.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the statement so that it is valid in a Common Criteria environment.
v For a CREATE TABLE statement that includes a lit of column definitions, if the statement is issued in a Common
Criteria environment (DSN6SPRM COMCRIT=YES), then every table created must have a security label. Designate
a column AS SECURITY LABEL or change the subsystem parameter.
v For a CREATE or DECLARE statement that includes a LIKE or AS FULLSELECT clause, remove the clause and
explicitly specify the attributes of the table that is being defined.
v Do not issue a CREATE or ALTER TABLE statement that attempts to define a materialized query table in a
Common Criteria environment.

-4739 ENVIRONMENT SETTINGS (IDENTIFIED BY envid1) USED BY object-name ARE NOT THE SAME AS THE ONES THAT WERE IN EFFECT (IDENTIFIED BYenvid2) WHEN OTHER COLUMN MASKS AND ROW PERMISSIONS WERE DEFINED FOR TABLE table-name
Explanation: A CREATE MASK or CREATE PERMISSIONS statement was issued with environment settings that do
not match the settings that were previously used. All column masks and row permissions defined for the same table
must use the same set of environment settings. The set of environment settings is determined when the first column
mask or row permission is defined for the table. To create a new column mask or row permission, the environment
settings in effect when the CREATE statement is issued must be the same as the environment set.
envid1 The environment settings that are used by the object that is identified by object-name.
object-name
The name of the object.
envid2 The environment settings that were in use when existing column masks and row permissions were defined
for the table that is identified by table-name.
table-name
The name of the table.
The SYSIBM.SYSENVIRONMENT catalog table contains the list of environment settings. The following set of
environment settings must be the same among the multiple column masks and row permissions that are defined for
a single table:
v ENVID
v CURRENT_SCHEMA
v PATHSCHEMAS
v APPLICATION_ ENCODING_ CCSID
v ORIGINAL_ ENCODING_ CCSID
v DECIMAL_POINT
v MIN_DIVIDE_SCALE
v SQL_STRING_ DELIMITER
v MIXED_DATA
v DECIMAL_ARITHMETIC
v DATE_FORMAT
v TIME_FORMAT
v ROUNDING
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Use the values of envid1 and envid2 in the SQL error message to query the
SYSIBM.SYSENVIRONMENT catalog table to locate the expected environment setting values. Correct the syntax, and
reissue the statement.

-4742 THE STATEMENT CANNOT BE EXECUTED BY DB2 OR IN THE ACCELERATOR (REASON reason-code)
Explanation: A statement cannot be executed by DB2 or by an accelerator server.
The statement cannot be executed by DB2 if any of the following conditions are true:
v Special register CURRENT GET_ACCEL_ARCHIVE is set to YES, and the statement needs to access data that is
stored only in the accelerator server.
v Special register CURRENT QUERY ACCELERATION is set to ALL, so the statement must be executed in the
accelerator server.
v A function that was referenced can be run only on an accelerator server. The MEDIAN function can be run only on
an accelerator server.
v The statement reference an accelerator-only table.
The statement cannot be executed by an accelerator server if any condition that is indicated by a reason code is true.
reason-code
A numeric value that provides additional information about why the statement cannot be executed in the
accelerator server.
Note: If you need more information about why the statement cannot be executed in the accelerator, issue
the EXPLAIN statement and examine the output of the table DSN_QUERYINFO_TABLE.
Possible values are:
1 No active accelerator server was found when the statement was executed.
2 The special register CURRENT QUERY ACCELERATION is set to NONE.
4 The query is not read-only.
6 The cursor is defined as scrollable or is a rowset-positioned cursor.
7 The query uses multiple encoding schemes.
8 The FROM clause of the query specifies a data-change-table-reference.
9 The query contains a nested table expression.
10 The query contains a recursive reference to a common table expression.
11 The query contains an unsupported expression.
12 The query references a table that has any of the following characteristics:
v Is not defined in the accelerator server
v Is defined in a different accelerator server from another table in the query
v Is defined in the accelerator server, but is not enabled for query acceleration
13 The accelerator server that contains the tables that are referenced in the query is not started.
14 A column that is referenced in the query was altered in DB2 after the data was loaded in the
accelerator server.
15 The query uses functionality that is available only in DB2 for z/OS Version 10 or later, and the
functionality is not supported by the accelerator server.
17 The query is an INSERT from SELECT statement. Subsystem parameter QUERY_ACCEL_OPTIONS
does not specify option 2 to enable the acceleration of INSERT from SELECT statements.
19 The accelerator server is not at the correct level and does not support a function in the SQL
statement.
21 The query contains a correlated subquery that is not supported for acceleration.
22 The statement references an accelerator-only table, but the statement is not offloadable. For
example:
v MERGE statement references an accelerator-only table.
v UPDATE or DELETE statement references an accelerator-only table, but the target table of the
UPDATE, DELETE is a normal DB2 table: UPDATE DB2_TABLE SET .. (SELECT .. FROM
ACCEL_ONLY_TABLE).
v INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE of a row expression with subselect. UPDATE
ACCEL_ONLY_TABLE SET (C1, C2) = (SELECT C3, C4 FROM TABLE2);
23 The SELECT INTO statement is bound for acceleration but is run as a remote SELECT INTO
statement, which is not supported for acceleration.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Use the reason code to determine the cause of the failure, and take the appropriate action:
1 Start the accelerator server.
2 Set special register CURRENT QUERY ACCELERATION to ENABLE, ENABLE WITH FAILBACK,
ELIGIBLE, or ALL.
4 Ensure that the query meets the criteria for a read-only query. See the information on read-only cursors in
DECLARE CURSOR (DB2 SQL).
6 Remove the SCROLL clause or WITH ROWSET POSITIONING clause from the cursor declaration.
7 Ensure that all objects to which the query refers have the same encoding scheme.
8 Rewrite the FROM clause of the query so that it does not include a data-change-table-reference clause.
9 Ensure that the FROM clause of the query does not contain a subquery.
10 Ensure that the FROM clause of the query does not reference a common table expression.
11 Remove the unsupported expression from the query.
12 Ensure that all tables that are referenced by the query are in the same accelerator server, and that all tables
are enabled for query acceleration.
13 Start the accelerator server that contains the tables that are referenced in the query.
14 Load the altered table into the accelerator server again.
15 Ensure that the query does not use any functionality that is not supported by the accelerator server.
17 Enable the acceleration of INSERT from SELECT statements by updating subsystem parameter
QUERY_ACCEL_OPTIONS to include option 2.
19 Update the accelerator server to enable acceleration of the SQL statement that contains the function text or
expression text.
21 Rewrite the correlated subquery that is not supported for acceleration as a JOIN expression. For some
examples, see How IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator for z/OS handles correlated subqueries.
22 Ensure the statement does not reference an accelerator-only table, or replace the accelerator-only table with a
DB2 table so that the query can be executed in DB2.
23 Remove the SELECT INTO statement, or REBIND the package with bind option
QUERYACCELERATION(NONE). If the program is an SQL PL procedure or function, use one of the
following methods instead of using BIND or REBIND PACKAGE:
v Alter the procedure or function by using ALTER PROCEDURE or ALTER FUNCTION
v Drop and then re-create the procedure or function by using CREATE PROCEDURE or CREATE
FUNCTION
SQLSTATE: 560D5
-4746 THE STATEMENT CANNOT BE PROCESSED FOR AN ACCELERATED QUERY. REASON CODE reason-code.
Explanation: The statement that involves an accelerated query cannot be processed for the reason indicated by
reason-code.
reason-code
A numeric value that indicates why the statement cannot be processed. reason-code can have one of the
following values:
1 The only FETCH statement that is allowed for a rowset cursor that is run by the accelerator is
FETCH NEXT ROWSET.
2 The FOR n ROWS clause must be specified on a FETCH NEXT ROWSET statement for a rowset
cursor that is run by the accelerator.
3 The value of n in the FOR n ROWS clause of a FETCH NEXT ROWSET statement does not match
the value in the previous FETCH NEXT ROWSET statement.
4 Target host variables must be specified for a FETCH NEXT ROWSET statement for a rowset cursor
that is run by the accelerator.
20 Option QUERY ACCELERATION or GET_ACCEL_ARCHIVE is used but is invalid because the
DB2 system parameter ACCEL is set to NO, and the DB2 subsystem is not enabled for query
acceleration.
21 Option QUERY ACCELERATION or GET_ACCEL_ARCHIVE is used but is invalid because the
DB2 table SYSACCEL.SYSACCELERATEDPACKAGES or its indexes do not exist or are not defined
correctly.
22 The DB2 table SYSACCEL.SYSACCELERATEDPACKAGES or its indexes do not exist or are not
defined correctly.
23 Option QUERY ACCELERATION or GET_ACCEL_ARCHIVE is used but is invalid because the
DB2 SYSACCEL tables or indexes do not exist or are not defined correctly.
24 The DB2 SYSACCEL tables or indexes do not exist or are not defined correctly.
Note: Reason codes 20 through 24 apply to the CREATE PROCEDURE and ALTER PROCEDURE statements for
native SQL procedures or to the CREATE FUNCTION and ALTER FUNCTION statements for SQL scalar functions.
They also apply to a remote bind request with DB2 for z/OS as the target. These reason codes map to the following
BIND or REBIND PACKAGE messages: DSNT320I, DSNT321I, DSNT322I, DSNT323I, and DSNT324I.

-16000 AN XQUERY EXPRESSION CANNOT BE PROCESSED BECAUSE THE context-component COMPONENT OF THE STATIC CONTEXT HAS NOT BEEN ASSIGNED. ERROR QNAME = err:XPST0001
Explanation: Static analysis of an expression relies on a component of the static context, context-component, that has
not been assigned a value.
System action: The XQuery expression cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Assign a value to the context-component.
SQLSTATE: 10501
-16001 AN XQUERY EXPRESSION STARTING WITH TOKEN token CANNOT BE PROCESSED BECAUSE THE FOCUS COMPONENT OF THE DYNAMIC CONTEXT HAS NOT BEEN ASSIGNED. ERROR QNAME = err:XPDY0002
Explanation: Evaluation of the expression starting with token token requires that the focus component of the
dynamic context be assigned. The token is being considered as the beginning of a path expression which does not
have an associated context item or context sequence. This might be the result of not specifying an XQuery context
item expression in the passing clause or the value of the XQuery context item expression is a null value. Another
common cause of this error is that the value in the XPath expression was intended to be a literal string but delimiting
quotation characters are missing.
System action: The XQuery expression cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Pass a value that is not null as the XQuery context item expression to XMLQuery or
XMLExists.

-16049 THE LEXICAL VALUE value IS NOT VALID FOR THE type-name DATA TYPE IN THE FUNCTION OR CAST. ERROR QNAME= err:FOCA0002
Explanation: A cast expression or function call includes a value that does not have the correct lexical form for the
type-name data type.
System action: The XQuery expression cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Try one of the following actions:
v If the error results from a function invocation, verify that the string parameters used for QNames or local names
have the correct lexical form.
v If the error results from a cast expression, verify that the source value is not one of the special float or double
values NaN, INF, or -INF.
SQLSTATE: 10602
-16051 THE VALUE value OF DATA TYPE source-type IS OUT OF RANGE FOR AN IMPLICIT OR EXPLICIT CAST TO TARGET DATA TYPE target-type. ERROR QNAME = err:error-qname
Explanation: An XQuery expression requires that the value with a data type of source-type be cast, either implicitly or
explicitly to the target data type target-type. The value is outside the defined range of values for that data type.
This error could be returned for a variety of error QNames such as FOAR0002, FOCA0001, or FOCA0003.
System action: The XQuery expression cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the XQuery expression to use a target data type with a range that supports the
specific value, or change the value to be within the defined range of the target data type.
SQLSTATE: 10602
-16052 NAN CANNOT BE USED AS A FLOAT OR DOUBLE VALUE IN A DATETIME OPERATION.  ERROR QNAME=ERR:FOCA0005.

to PT14H00M.
SQLSTATE: 10605
-16061 THE VALUE value CANNOT BE CONSTRUCTED AS, OR CAST (USING AN IMPLICIT OR EXPLICIT CAST) TO THE DATA TYPE data-type. ERROR QNAME = err:FORG0001
Explanation: An XQuery expression attempted to use the value value as a data-type value but the value is not valid
for the data type. The following situations might cause this error:
v A value was explicitly passed to a cast function or specified in a cast expression with a target data type of
data-type.
v An expression that included value implicitly cast the value to the target data type of data-type. Many XQuery
expressions use implicit casting to process the expressions. For example, implicit casting is used in general
comparisons of numeric values that require the values to be of data type xs:double.
System action: The XQuery expression cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Try one of the following actions:
v If the error occurs in an expression that casts from one primitive type to another, verify that casting from the
source type to the target type is supported. If the cast is not supported, either remove the expression or cast the
value to a different data type.
v Check for expressions that would result in implicit casting with values that may not conform to the data type of
the implicit cast and add conditions to the expression to avoid the error.
SQLSTATE: 10608
-16065 AN EMPTY SEQUENCE CANNOT BE CAST TO THE DATA TYPE data-type, ERROR QNAME = err:FORG0006
Explanation: A namespace declaration or namespace declaration attribute specifies a string value that is not a valid
URI.
System action: The XQuery expression cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Specify a string value that is a valid URI. A valid URI must conform to the generic URI
syntax specified by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

-16066 THE ARGUMENT PASSED TO THE AGGREGATE FUNCTION function-name IS NOT VALID.  ERROR QNAME = err:FORG0006
Explanation: The argument that was passed to the aggregate function function-name is not valid because the
argument does not meet any of the conditions that are required for arguments to the function function-name.
System action: The XQuery expression cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If the function is fn:sum, verify that the following conditions are met:
v All items in the input sequence must be numeric or derived from a single base type.
v The type must support addition.
v The values must all be promotable to a single common type if the input sequence contains numeric values.
SQLSTATE: 10608
-16067 THE FLAGS ARGUMENT VALUE PASSED TO THE FUNCTION function-name IS NOT VALID.  ERROR QNAME= err:FORX0001
Explanation: The function function-name includes a value that was passed to the function as a regular expression
flag parameter. However, the string that was passed to the function includes characters that are not defined as flags.
Programmer response: Modify the function call to pass in a string argument that contains only characters that are
defined as flags. Valid characters include s, m, i or x.
SQLSTATE: 10609
-16068 THE REGULAR EXPRESSION ARGUMENT VALUE PASSED TO THE FUNCTION function-name IS NOT VALID. ERROR QNAME= err:FORX0002

Explanation: The value that was specified for the pattern parameter in a call to the function function-name matches a
zero-length string. A zero-length string is not a valid pattern for this function because the pattern will never match a
substring in the input string.
Programmer response: Pass a valid pattern to the function call, or remove the function call from the expression.
SQLSTATE: 10609
-16075 THE SEQUENCE TO BE SERIALIZED CONTAINS AN ITEM THAT IS AN ATTRIBUTE NODE.  ERROR QNAME = err:SENR0001
Explanation: A request was made to serialize an XML value. The XML value is a sequence containing an item that
is an XQuery attribute node. There is no defined sequence normalization for an attribute node as an item in a
sequence and therefore the sequence cannot be serialized.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Remove any items in the sequence containing just an attribute node or do not attempt to serialize
the sequence.

ERROR QNAME=err:XUDY0023.
Explanation: An expression has introduced a new namespace binding for a prefix into an element node that
conflicts with one of the existing namespace bindings of the in-scope namespaces of that node.
expression-type
The type of expression.
prefix-string
The prefix.
uri-string
The URI in the new namespace binding.
element-name
The name of the XML element.
The element node could be the target in the updating expression or the parent of the target in the updating
expression. For example, an insert expression might insert an attribute into an existing element. If the QName of the
inserted attribute binds prefix P to some URI, but an in-scope namespace of the element node binds the same prefix
P to a different URI, a conflict is detected and this error is issued.
System action: The XQuery expression cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If the expression is intentionally introducing a new namespace binding, modify the
expression so that is uses a namespace prefix that is different from all existing prefixes of the in-scope namespaces of
the indicated element. Otherwise, modify the expression so that the binding of the prefix string uses the same URI as
the existing namespace binding of the in-scope namespaces of the indicated element.

THE PREFIX prefix-string IS BOUND TO uri-string WHILE ANOTHER BINDING OF THE SAME PREFIX USES A DIFFERENT NAMESPACE URI. ERROR QNAME=err:XUDY0024.
Explanation: The combined effect of updating expressions in the XMLMODIFY function has been to introduce
conflicting namespace bindings into an element node.
expression-type
The type of expression.
element-name
The name of the XML element.
prefix-string
The prefix.
uri-string
The URI in the current namespace binding.
Possible causes for this error include:
v Two attributes might have been inserted whose QNames have the same namespace prefix but different namespace
URIs.
v If expression-type is ¡°insert¡± or ¡°replace¡±, the conflicting namespace bindings might be between two attribute nodes
in the sequence of attribute nodes in the insertion sequence or replacement sequence.
v A namespace binding might have been introduced to the indicated element for an attribute node that was inserted
or replaced by another updating expression in the same XMLMODIFY function.
System action: The XQuery expression cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If the expression is intentionally introducing a new namespace binding, modify the
expression so that is uses a namespace prefix that is different from all other prefixes used in the updating expressions
of the same XMLMODIFY function that have the indicated element as the target or parent of an attribute node target.
Otherwise, modify the expression so that the binding of the prefix uses the same URI as the other namespace
bindings used in the updating expressions of the same XMLMODIFY function that have the indicated element as the
target or parent of an attribute node target.

-16246 INCOMPLETE ANNOTATION MAPPING AT OR NEAR LINE lineno IN XML SCHEMA DOCUMENT uri. REASON CODE = reason-code.
Explanation: The annotation mapping the XML schema item near line in uri, to a database object is missing some
information. Possible values for reason code include:
1. A rowset name is not specified or is not fully qualified.
2. Any mapping must specify either a target column or a condition. Neither a target column nor a condition is
specified.
3. The annotation has an unexpected format.
The XML schema document can be determined by matching uri to the SCHEMALOCATION column of table
SYSIBM.XSROBJECTCOMPONENTS.
The XML schema is not enabled for decomposition.
User response: Modify the annotations in the XML schema. Possible actions based on the reason-code include:
1. Specify a rowset name or fully qualify the rowset name.
2. Specify either a target column or a condition.
3. Correct the format of the annotation.
Consult annotated XML schema documentation on the specified annotation to make sure that all required
components have supplied values.
SQLSTATE: 225DE
-16247 SOURCE XML TYPE source-data-type CANNOT BE MAPPED TO TARGET SQL TYPE target-data-type IN THE ANNOTATION AT OR NEAR LINE lineno IN XML SCHEMA DOCUMENT uri
Explanation: Annotation at or around line lineno in XML schema document uri maps a XML schema type
source-data-type to an incompatible SQL type target-data-type. The XML schema document can be determined by
matching uri to the SCHEMALOCATION column of table SYSIBM.XSROBJECTCOMPONENTS.
The XML schema is not enabled for decomposition.
User response: Consult annotated XML schema documentation on compatibility between XML schema types and
SQL types. Correct the annotation appropriately.
SQLSTATE: 225DE
-16248 UNKNOWN ANNOTATION annotation-name AT OR NEAR LINE lineno IN XML SCHEMA DOCUMENT uri
Explanation: The annotated XML schema document uri contains an error in the annotation at or near the line
containing lineno. The unrecognized name given in the annotation tag is annotation-name.
The XML schema document can be determined by matching uri to the SCHEMALOCATION column of table
SYSIBM.XSROBJECTCOMPONENTS.
System action: The XML schema is not enabled for decomposition. The XSR_COMPLETE invocation fails with this
SQLCODE.
User response: Consult annotated XML schema documentation for list of legal annotations and their syntax. Correct
or remove the unknown annotation.
SQLSTATE: 225DE
-16249 THE db2-xdb:expression ANNOTATION expression AT OR NEAR LINE lineno IN XML SCHEMA DOCUMENT uri IS TOO LONG.
Explanation: String length of the specified expression exceeded the maximum allowed. The XML schema document
can be determined by matching uri to the SCHEMALOCATION column of table
SYSIBM.XSROBJECTCOMPONENTS.
The XML schema is not enabled for decomposition. The XSR_COMPLETE invocation fails with this SQLCODE.
User response: Consult annotated XML schema documentation on the limit for strings specified in db2-xdb:expression
expression annotations. Correct the expression appropriately.
SQLSTATE: 225DE
-16250 THE db2-xdb:defaultSQLSchema WITH VALUE schema-name AT OR NEAR LINE lineno IN XML SCHEMA DOCUMENT uri CONFLICTS WITH ANOTHER db2-xdb:defaultSQLSchema SPECIFIED IN ONE OF THE XML SCHEMA DOCUMENTS WITHIN THE SAME XML SCHEMA.
Explanation: There can only be one value for the db2-xdb:defaultSQLSchema annotation across all XML schema
documents that comprise an annotated XML schema. The specified SQL schema name schema-name at or near the line
number lineno in the XML schema document uri conflicts with another value for db2-xdb:defaultSQLSchema annotation
in this or another XML schema document of the XML schema. The XML schema document can be determined by
matching uri to the SCHEMALOCATION column of table SYSIBM.XSROBJECTCOMPONENTS.
The XML schema is not enabled for decomposition.
User response: Correct the annotated XML schema such that all specifications of db2-xdb:defaultSQLSchema are
consistent.
SQLSTATE: 225DE
-16251 DUPLICATE ANNOTATION DEFINED FOR object-name AT OR NEAR location IN XML SCHEMA DOCUMENT uri
Explanation: There is more than one annotation for object-name in the annotated XML schema. A duplicate
annotation has been found for this object at or around location in XML schema document uri. The XML schema
document can be determined by matching uri to the SCHEMALOCATION column of table
SYSIBM.XSROBJECTCOMPONENTS.
System action: The XML schema is not enabled for decomposition. The XSR_COMPLETE invocation fails with this
SQLCODE.
Programmer response: Correct the annotated XML schema by removing the duplicate annotation from the XML
schema documents of the XML schema.
SQLSTATE: 225DE
-16252 THE db2-xdb:rowSet NAME rowset-name SPECIFIED AT OR NEAR LINE lineno IN THE XML SCHEMA DOCUMENT uri IS ALREADY ASSOCIATED WITH ANOTHER TABLE
Explanation: A rowset in an annotated XML schema must correspond to exactly one table. The rowset declaration at
or near line lineno declares an association between rowset rowsetname and the table specified in the enclosing
db2-xdb:table annotation. The specified rowset has already been associated to a different table in another
db2-xdb:table annotation. The XML schema document can be determined by matching uri to the
SCHEMALOCATION column of table SYSIBM.XSROBJECTCOMPONENTS.
The XML schema is not enabled for decomposition.
User response: Correct the annotated XML schema such that each rowset name is uniquely associated with exactly
one table across the annotated XML schema documents of the XML schema.
SQLSTATE: 225DE
-16253 THE db2-xdb:condition ANNOTATION condition AT OR NEAR LINE lineno IN XML SCHEMA DOCUMENT uri IS TOO LONG.
Explanation: The length of the string associated with db2-xdb:condition that starts with condition exceeds the
maximum allowed. The db2-xdb:condition is found at or around line number lineno in XML schema document uri.
The XML schema document can be determined by matching uri to the SCHEMALOCATION column of table
SYSIBM.XSROBJECTCOMPONENTS.
The XML schema is not enabled for decomposition.
User response: Reduce the size of the condition string for db2-xdb:condition in the XML schema document. Consult
annotated XML schema documentation on the limit for strings specified in db2-xdb:condition annotations.
SQLSTATE: 225DE
-16254 A db2-xdb:locationPath locationpath AT OR NEAR LINE lineno IN XML SCHEMA DOCUMENT uri IS NOT VALID WITH REASON CODE reason-code.
Explanation: A value specified in the annotated schema for db2-xdb:locationPath is not valid. The XML schema
document can be determined by matching uri to the SCHEMALOCATION column of table
SYSIBM.XSROBJECTCOMPONENTS. Possible values for reason code include:
1. Some element or attribute has a namespace prefix that is not mapped to a URI. All namespace prefixes used in
the location path must have been associated with a namespace in the XML schema document containing the
annotation specifying this location path.
2. Invalid syntax for a location path.
3. The specified path does not match any possible path from a root node to a location where the element or attribute
may appear in an instance document.
System action: The XML schema is not enabled for decomposition. The XSR_COMPLETE invocation fails with this
SQLCODE
User response: Modify the annotations in the XML schema. Possible actions based on the reason-code include:
1. Ensure that namespace prefixes in the db2-xdb:locationPath are correct or add a declaration for the missing
namespace.
2. Ensure that the syntax of the value for db2-xdb:locationPath is valid syntax for a location path.
3. Ensure that the value for db2-xdb:locationPath corresponds to a possible path from the root node to the element
or attribute at the end of the location path.
SQLSTATE: 225DE
-16255 A db2-xdb:rowSet VALUE rowset-name USED AT OR NEAR LINE lineno IN XML SCHEMA DOCUMENT uri CONFLICTS WITH A db2-xdb:table ANNOTATION WITH THE SAME NAME.
Explanation: The annotated XML schema contains a db2-xdb:table annotation which declares a table named
rowsetname, but the annotated XML schema does not have any db2-xdb:rowSet annotation declaration to associate
rowsetname to any table. If a rowset is not declared in any db2-xdb:table annotation, it is implicitly associated to a
table with the same name qualified by the value of db2-xdb:defaultSQLSchema. The annotated XML schema cannot
use a db2-xdb:rowSet annotation that relies on an implicit association between a rowset and a table with the same
name of rowset-name, and at the same time declare a table named rowset-name using a db2-xdb:table annotation. The
XML schema document can be determined by matching uri to the SCHEMALOCATION column of table
SYSIBM.XSROBJECTCOMPONENTS.
The XML schema is not enabled for decomposition.
User response: Correct the annotated XML schema by adding a db2-xdb:rowSet child element to the db2-xdb:table
element with name rowset-name. This will explicitly associate the rowset to the table.
SQLSTATE: 225DE
-16257 XML SCHEMA FEATURE feature SPECIFIED IS NOT SUPPORTED FOR DECOMPOSITION.
Explanation: Decomposition on an XML schema with feature is not supported. This feature is used in the XML
schema. In some cases, the presence of the unsupported feature in the XML schema results in failure to enable for
decomposition. In other cases, having annotations in the decomposition namespace on the unsupported feature
results in failure to enable for decomposition.
System action: The XML schema is not enabled for decomposition. The XSR_COMPLETE invocation fails with this
SQLCODE.
User response: Remove the feature from the XML schema or remove the decomposition annotations associated with
the feature, as appropriate. Consult decomposition documentation on the restrictions on use of the specified XML
schema feature.
SQLSTATE: 225DE
-16258 THE XML SCHEMA CONTAINS A RECURSIVE ELEMENT WHICH IS AN UNSUPPORTED FEATURE FOR DECOMPOSITION. THE RECURSIVE ELEMENT IS IDENTIFIED AS elementnamespace : elementname OF TYPE typenamespace : typename.
Explanation: XML schemas with recursive elements are not supported for decomposition. At least one recursive
element was found identified as elementnamespace:elementname of type typenamespace:typename.
The XML schema is not enabled for decomposition.
User response: Remove the use of recursion from the XML schema.
SQLSTATE: 225DE
-16259 INVALID MANY-TO-MANY MAPPINGS DETECTED IN XML SCHEMA DOCUMENT uri1 NEAR LINE lineno1 AND IN XML SCHEMA DOCUMENT uri2 NEAR LINE lineno2.
Explanation: The two identified annotations specify an invalid many-to-many relationship between elements that
map to the same rowset. If two element declarations have a sequence model group as their lowest common ancestor
then only one of the paths from the element declaration up to that model group can have maxOccurs>1 on one or
more elements declarations or modelgroups in that path. The XML schema documents can be determined by
matching uri1 and uri2 to the SCHEMALOCATION column of catalog view SYSCAT.XSROBJECTCOMPONENTS.
The XML schema is not enabled for decomposition.
User response: Correct the annotations such that there are no many-to-many mappings. Consult annotated XML
schema documentation for rules on mapping elements and attributes.
sqlcode: -16259
sqlstate: 225DE
-16260 XML SCHEMA ANNOTATIONS INCLUDE NO MAPPINGS TO ANY COLUMN OF ANY TABLE.
Explanation: The XML schema contains no annotations that map an XML element or attribute to any column of any
table.
The XML schema is not enabled for decomposition since it provides no information for performing decomposition.
User response: Add annotations to the XML schema so that at least one XML element or attribute is mapped to a
column of a table.
SQLSTATE: 225DE
-16262 THE ANNOTATED XML SCHEMA HAS NO COLUMNS MAPPED FOR ROWSET rowsetname.
Explanation: The set of annotations involving rowset rowsetname contain no mappings to any column. In order for a
rowset to be target for decomposition, at least one column must be mapped to some XML element or attribute.
User response: Add an annotation that maps a column of the specified rowset to some XML element or attribute. If
the rowset is not intended to be a target for decomposition, remove references to the rowset from the annotated XML
schema.
SQLSTATE: 225DE
-16265 THE XML DOCUMENT CANNOT BE DECOMPOSED USING XML SCHEMA xsrobject-name WHICH IS NOT ENABLED OR IS INOPERATIVE FOR DECOMPOSITION.
Explanation: The XML schema identified by xsrobject-name is not in the correct state to perform decomposition. The
XML schema could be in one of the following states:
v Not enabled for decomposition (possibly never enabled)
v Disabled for decomposition
v Inoperative for decomposition because of changes to the definitions of one or more tables specified in the
annotations.
Decomposition can only be performed using XML schemas that are enabled for decomposition.
XML decomposition was not started.
User response: Ensure that the XML schema is enabled for decomposition before attempting to use it for
decomposition of an XML document. The decomposition status of an XML schema can be checked by selecting the
DECOMPOSITION column of SYSCAT.XSROBJECTS for the XML schema identified by xsrobject-name.
SQLSTATE: 225DE
-16266 AN SQL ERROR OCCURRED DURING DECOMPOSITION OF DOCUMENT docid WHILE ATTEMPTING TO INSERT DATA. INFORMATION RETURNED FOR THE ERROR INCLUDES SQLCODE sqlcode, SQLSTATE sqlstate, AND MESSAGE TOKENS token-list.
Explanation: An SQL error occurred during decomposition of an XML document with document identifier docid.
The error occurred while attempting an SQL insert operation based on some piece of data from the XML document.
Some possible causes: format of data is incompatible with the target column's data type; length of data exceeds
column size; providing null value for a column defined as non-null. The sqlcode, sqlstate and message token list
(each token is separated by the vertical bar character) are provided. The message tokens may be truncated. See the
corresponding message for the sqlcode for further explanation of the error.
The XML document docid was not decomposed.
User response: Check the message associated with the SQLCODE. Follow the action suggested by that message. See
db2diag.log for complete information about the error condition.
SQLSTATE: 225DE
-20003 GBPCACHE NONE CANNOT BE SPECIFIED FOR TABLESPACE OR INDEX IN GRECP
Explanation: GBPCACHE NONE was specified on an ALTER TABLESPACE or ALTER INDEX statement, but the
table space, index, or the partition to be altered is in GRECP.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Use the START DATABASE command to recover the table space or index from the GRECP then
STOP the table space or index before reissuing the ALTER statement.
SQLSTATE: 560A7
-20004 8K or 16K BUFFERPOOL PAGESIZE INVALID FOR A WORKFILE OBJECT
Explanation: This message is issued when a statement specifies an 8K or 16K pagesize in the BUFFERPOOL clause
for a workfile object. The error can occur for the following SQL statements:
v A CREATE or ALTER DATABASE statement.
v A CREATE or ALTER TABLESPACE statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Correct the statement to specify a 4K or 32K bufferpool pagesize.
SQLSTATE: 560A8
-20005 THE INTERNAL ID LIMIT OF limit HAS BEEN EXCEEDED FOR OBJECT TYPE object-type
Explanation: An internal ID is used to uniquely identify objects of type object-type. The limit for internal IDs for this
type of object is limit, and this limit has been exceeded.
This could occur during a CREATE FUNCTION, CREATE PROCEDURE, CREATE SEQUENCE, CREATE TYPE, or
CREATE or ALTER TABLE statement that defines an identity column.
System action: The SQL statement cannot be executed.
Programmer response: Drop objects of object-type that are not being used, and retry the statement.
SQLSTATE: 54035
-20008 ATTEMPT TO USE AN UNSUPPORTED FEATURE ON OBJECT object-name. REASON CODE: reason-code
Explanation: The statement attempted to use a feature or format that is not supported.
reason-code
A numeric value that identifies the unsupported feature:
1 The statement attempted use the XML schema decomposition feature. Processing continues and the
stored procedure was invoked. This situation can occur when the following stored procedures are
called:
v SYSPROC.XSR_COMPLETE with the 'issuedfordecomposition' flag set to 1
v SYSPROC.XDBDECOMPXML
v SYSPROC.XDBDECOMPXML100MB
2 The table that is indicated by object-name is defined with a format that is no longer supported by
EXPLAIN. Only one instance of this message is issued per package for EXPLAIN tables in
supported formats during bind or rebind.
3 TYPE 1 is a deprecated feature for indexes and is no longer supported. Only TYPE 2 can be
specified.
object-name
When reason-code is 2, the name of the table. Otherwise, *N.
System action: The statement or EXPLAIN operation cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change your SQL statement to avoid using the unsupported feature or format. Take the
action that corresponds to the reason-code value:
1 Update your SQL statement to change any implicit or explicit reference to the XML schema decomposition
feature so that they use the XMLTABLE function for the decomposition of an XML document.
2 Either migrate the EXPLAIN tables to the current format or redefine them by dropping and re-creating them
in the required format.
3 Update the SQL statement to remove references to the unsupported clause.

-20058 THE FULLSELECT SPECIFIED FOR MATERIALIZED QUERY TABLE table-name IS NOT VALID.
Explanation: The materialized query table definition has specific rules regarding the contents of the fullselect, and
the fullselect that was specified did not conform to these rules.
table-name
The name of the materialized query table.
General restrictions: The following restrictions apply:
v The length of each result column of the fullselect must not be 0.
v The fullselect cannot contain a column of a LOB or XML data type.
v No more than one table in the fullselect can contain a security label column.
v The fullselect must not contain a period specification.
v The object that is specified in the FROM clause of the fullselect cannot be a view with columns of length 0.
v The fullselect cannot contain a reference to a created global temporary table, a declared global temporary table, an
accelerator-only table, or another materialized query table.
v The fullselect cannot directly or indirectly reference a base table that has been activated for the row or column
access control or a base table for which a row permission or a column mask has been defined.
v The fullselect must not refer to host variables or include parameter markers.
Additional restrictions when ENABLE QUERY OPTIMIZATION is in effect:
v The fullselect must be a subselect.
v The outermost SELECT list of the subselect must not reference data that is encoded with different CCSID sets.
v The subselect cannot include the following:
¨C A special register

Explanation: The bind subcommand bind-type with bind-subtype is not valid for the type of package specified for one
of the following reasons:
v The subcommand REBIND TRIGGER PACKAGE can be used only for trigger packages.
v The subcommand BIND PACKAGE DEPLOY can be used only for SQL functions or native SQL procedure
packages.
v The subcommand FREE PACKAGE can be used only for non-trigger and non-native SQL procedures.
csect-name
The name of the control section that issued the message.
bind-type
The type of bind subcommand: REBIND or FREE.
bind-subtype
The subtype of bind subcommand: TRIGGER or DEPLOY.
authorization-id
The authorization ID that is attempting the prohibited action.
If you are using a trusted context, the token authorization-id might return a role instead of an authorization
ID. A role is returned if a role was in effect and the authorization checking is performed against the role
rather than the authorization ID of the session when the condition was encountered.
role-name
The name of the role, in the format: ¡¯Role: role-name¡¯
package-type
The type of package: trigger, SQL function, or native SQL procedure.
package-name
The name of the package, in the format ¡¯collection.package¡¯.
System action: The package that is specified is not deployed, rebound, or freed.
System programmer response: For a package that is not a trigger package, rebind using the subcommand REBIND
PACKAGE. Call the bind subcommand again, and specify a collection package that is an accepted package.

Drop the materialized query tables that reference the functions or alter the materialized query tables that reference
the functions into base tables before issuing the ALTER FUNCTION statement.
SQLSTATE: 42927
-20074 THE OBJECT object-name CANNOT BE CREATED BECAUSE THE FIRST THREE CHARACTERS ARE RESERVED FOR SYSTEM OBJECTS
Explanation: An attempt was made to create an object, but the name that was specified cannot be used because it
begins with reserved characters.
object-name
The name of the object.
The following restrictions apply to object names:
Reserved prefix ¡°SYS¡±
With a few exceptions, the string ¡°SYS¡± is not permitted in the first three characters of an object name.
This message is also issued for a GRANT statement in response to an attempt to grant the CREATEIN,
ALTERIN or DROPIN privileges on a schema with the ¡°SYS¡± prefix. The same restrictions apply in this case.
Prefix ¡°DSN¡±
A database name cannot consist of the string ¡°DSN¡± followed by five digits.
Role names
Role names cannot start with any of the following strings:
v ACCESSCTRL
v DATAACCESS
v DBADM
v DBCTRL
v DBMAINT
v NONE
v NULL
v PACKADM
v PUBLIC
v SECADM
v SQLADM

-20091 A VIEW NAME WAS SPECIFIED AFTER LIKE IN ADDITION TO THE INCLUDING IDENTITY COLUMN ATTRIBUTES CLAUSE
Explanation: The LIKE clause specified the name of a view in combination with the INCLUDING IDENTITY
COLUMN ATTRIBUTES clause. This usage is not supported.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Remove the INCLUDING IDENTITY COLUMN ATTRIBUTES clause and resubmit the
statement to copy the existing view definition without the identity column attributes.
In the case of DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE, it is possible to get the identity column attributes for a
column of a view using the AS subselect clause with INCLUDING IDENTITY COLUMN ATTRIBUTES instead. For
example:
DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE ....
AS (SELECT * FROM view-name) DEFINITION ONLY
INCLUDING IDENTITY COLUMN ATTRIBUTES
SQLSTATE: 560AD
-20092 A TABLE OR VIEW WAS SPECIFIED IN THE LIKE CLAUSE, BUT THE OBJECT CANNOT BE USED IN THIS CONTEXT
Explanation: The LIKE clause specified the name of a table or view that is not valid for one of the following
reasons:
v If the object is a view, it is not allowed in the LIKE clause because the view includes a ROWID or XML column.
This is not supported.
v If the object is a table, it is not allowed in the LIKE clause because it is defined as a clone of another table.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Specify the name of a view that does not contain a ROWID column (or distinct type column
for which the source type is ROWID), or specify the name of a table and resubmit the statement.
Specify the name of a table that is not a clone table, if you specified a table in the LIKE clause that is defined as the
clone of another table.
SQLSTATE: 560AE
-20093 THE TABLE table-name CANNOT BE CONVERTED TO OR FROM A MATERIALIZED QUERY TABLE, OR THE MATERIALIZED QUERY TABLE PROPERTY CANNOT BE ALTERED. REASON CODE = reason-code.
Explanation: The ALTER TABLE statement was not able to make one of the following changes:
v Change a table from a materialized query table to a base table.
v Change a base table to a materialized query table.
v Change the materialized query table properties.
reason-code
A numeric value that indicates the reason for the failure.
2 The table is not a materialized query table, and DROP MATERIALIZED QUERY is specified.
4 The table has at least one trigger defined.
5 The table has at least one check constraint defined.
6 The table has at least one unique constraint or index or has hash organization.
7 The table has at least one referential constraint defined.
8 The table is referenced in one of the following definitions:
v The definition of an existing materialized query table
v The definition of a view when altering to a system-maintained materialized query table
9 The table is referenced directly or indirectly (through a view, for example) in the fullselect.
10 The table is already a materialized query table.
11 The number of columns of the existing table does not match the number of columns that are
defined in the select list of the fullselect.
12 The data types of the columns of the existing table do not exactly match the corresponding columns
in the select list of the fullselect.
13 The column names of the columns of the existing table do not exactly match the corresponding
column names in the select list of the fullselect.
14 The nullability, default, or other characteristics of the columns of the existing table do not match the
characteristics of the corresponding columns in the select list of the fullselect.
15 The conversion cannot be performed if the same ALTER TABLE statement has other table
alterations.
16 The table is not a materialized query table, and alteration of materialized query table properties
was specified.
17 The table identifies a base table that is activated for row or column access control or for which a
row permission or a column mask is defined.
19 The table cannot be defined as a materialized query table because it is a system-period temporal
table or a history table.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Take the action that corresponds to the reason-code value:
2 You do not need to convert this table. No action is required.
4 Drop any triggers, and resubmit the ALTER TABLE statement.
5 Drop any check constraints, and resubmit the ALTER TABLE statement.
6 Drop any unique constraint and unique indexes, and resubmit the ALTER TABLE statement.
7 Drop the referential constraints, and resubmit the ALTER TABLE statement.
8 Drop the materialized query table that references the table, and resubmit the ALTER TABLE statement.
9 A materialized query table cannot reference itself. Modify the fullselect to remove the direct or indirect
reference to the table that is being altered.
10 The operation is not allowed since the table is already a materialized query table.
11 Modify the fullselect to include the correct number of columns in the select list.
12 Modify the fullselect so that the result column data types exactly match the data types of the corresponding
existing columns.
13 Modify the fullselect so that the result column names exactly match the column names of the corresponding
existing columns.
14 The table cannot be converted to a materialized query table unless the nullability characteristics can be
matched. Create a new materialized query table instead.
15 Perform the other table alterations in an ALTER TABLE statement that do not include the ADD
MATERIALIZED QUERY clause.
16 Take one of the following actions:
v Correct the table name to specify a materialized query table.
v Use the ALTER TABLE statement to convert the table to a materialized query table with the required
properties.
17 Take one of the following actions:
v Deactivate the access control and drop row permissions and column masks for the table.
v Choose a different base table to convert to a materialized query table.
19 Take one of the following actions:
v Correct the table name to specify a table that is not a system maintained temporal table or history table.
v Alter the system-period temporal table with an ALTER TABLE statement that includes a DROP
VERSIONING clause.

from-ccsid represents the CCSID that is currently in use for the database or table space.
to-ccsid is the CCSID that specified on the alter statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: The SQL REFERENCE contains a list of CCSIDs that can be specified on this statement. Only
these CCSIDs can be altered, and then, only to the corresponding value listed in the table. Altering the CCSID of a
database or table space to a value not listed in the table is not permitted.
SQLSTATE: 42856
-20106 THE CCSID FOR THE TABLE SPACE OR DATABASE CANNOT BE CHANGED BECAUSE THE TABLE SPACE OR DATABASE ALREADY CONTAINS A TABLE THAT IS REFERENCED IN EXISTING VIEW, OR MATERIALIZED QUERY TABLE DEFINITIONS OR AN EXTENDED INDEX
Explanation: An ALTER statement cannot be used to alter the CCSID for a table space or database that contains a
table that is referenced in an existing view, or materialized query table definitions, or a table that already has an
extended index.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: To alter the CCSID for the specified space, complete the following steps:
1. Drop any existing view or materialized query table definitions that refer to tables contained in the identified
space.
2. Drop all of the extended indexes created on the table.
3. Reissue the ALTER statement.

-20108 A RESULT SET CONTAINS AN UNSUPPORTED DATA TYPE IN POSITION NUMBER position-number FOR CURSOR cursor-name OPENED BY STORED PROCEDURE procedure-name
Explanation: Stored procedure procedure-name cannot return one or more query result sets. cursor-name indicates the
first query result set that the stored procedure cannot return. The column at position-number in the query result set
contains a data type that is not supported by the requester or the server.
System action: The CALL statement cannot be executed.
Programmer response: Modify the stored procedure at the server to return result sets that include only data types
that are supported by the requester. You may also upgrade the level of code at the requester to one that supports the
data type(s) that were returned by the server.
SQLSTATE: 56084
-20110 CANNOT IMPLICITLY CONNECT TO A REMOTE SITE WITH A SAVEPOINT OUTSTANDING
Explanation: The statement referenced an object at a remote DBMS with an alias or a three-part name when an
active savepoint exists. Such a reference requires an implicit connection to the remote DBMS, which is not allowed
when there is an outstanding savepoint.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Either release the savepoint, or move the data.
SQLSTATE: 51036
-20111 CANNOT ISSUE SAVEPOINT, RELEASE SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT FROM A TRIGGER, FROM A USER-DEFINED FUNCTION, OR FROM A GLOBAL TRANSACTION

-20117 A WINDOW SPECIFICATION FOR AN OLAP SPECIFICATION IS NOT VALID. REASON CODE = reason-code.
Explanation: The window specification (OVER clause) of an OLAP specification invocation is not correctly specified.
reason-code
The incorrect specification:
1 RANGE or ROWS is specified without an ORDER BY clause in the window specification.
2 RANGE is specified and the ORDER BY clause in the window specification includes more than one
sort key expression.
3 RANGE is specified and the data type of the range value cannot be used in a subtraction
expression with the data type of the sort key expression in the ORDER BY clause in the window
specification.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Take the action that corresponds to the reason-code value:
For reason-code:
1 Add a window ORDER BY clause to each window specification that specifies RANGE or ROWS.
2 Ensure that each window specification that includes RANGE has exactly one sort key expression in
the window ORDER BY clause.
3 For each window specification that includes RANGE, ensure that the range value can be subtracted
from the sort key expression in the window ORDER BY clause, which must be a numeric type or
datetime type. For datetime sort key expressions, the range value must be the specific datetime
duration decimal type with the correct precision and scale.

a fullselect in the RETURN statement of the TABLE function body.
SQLSTATE: 428F1
-20123 CALL TO STORED PROCEDURE procedure-name FAILED BECAUSE THE RESULT SET RETURNED FOR CURSOR cursor-name IS SCROLLABLE, BUT THE CURSOR IS NOT POSITIONED BEFORE THE FIRST ROW
Explanation: A scrollable result set for a cursor has been returned by a call to a stored procedure, and one or more
of these cursors is not positioned before the first row.
procedure-name
The name of the stored procedure.
cursor-name
The name of the cursor.
System action: The call to the stored procedure was unsuccessful. All result set cursors that are defined in the
stored procedure were closed before returning to the caller. The scrollable cursor can not be used to fetch from the
result set. Actions completed by the stored procedure are not rolled back, and any external actions initiated by the
stored procedure have completed because the error was detected upon completion of the stored procedure.
Programmer response: Modify the content of the stored procedure to ensure that the result set cursors are
positioned before the first row before returning to the caller.

-20124 OPEN CURSOR cursor FAILED BECAUSE THE CURSOR IS SCROLLABLE BUT THE CLIENT DOES NOT SUPPORT THIS
Explanation: The cursor cursor has been defined as scrollable, but the client is downlevel and does not support
scrollable cursors. The DRDA Application Requestor is not able to process scrollable result sets.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Modify the definition of the cursor to not be scrollable.
SQLSTATE: 560B2
-20125 CALL TO STORED PROCEDURE procedure-name FAILED BECAUSE THE RESULT SET FOR CURSOR cursor-name IS SCROLLABLE, BUT THE CLIENT DOES NOT SUPPORT THIS, REASON reason-code.
Explanation: A scrollable result set for a cursor has been returned by a CALL for a stored procedure, but the cursor
has an attribute or is in a state that prevents it from being returned to the calling application.
procedure-name
The stored procedure that failed.
cursor-name
The scrollable cursor.
reason-code
A numeric value that indicates the reason for the failure. Possible values are:
0 The cursor is scrollable, but the client is downlevel and does not support scrollable cursors. The
DRDA Application Requestor is not able to process scrollable result sets
1 The cursor is declared on a server different from the one on which the stored procedure executes,
and it contains one or more columns with an SQL type of XML. The calling application might be
executing on the local DB2 system or on another DRDA requester system. The stored procedure
executed one or more remote FETCH requests against the cursor, and the last remote FETCH
request had one or more binary XML targets. Because the cursor is declared on another server, the
last stored procedure FETCH request defines the format of XML data returned by the DRDA server
to be binary XML. Returning such a cursor as a result set is not allowed for the local DB2 system or
for the DRDA requester on which the calling application is executing.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. All result set cursors that are defined in the stored procedure
were closed before returning to the caller. The scrollable cursor cannot be used to FETCH from the result set. Actions
that were completed by the stored procedure are not rolled back, and any actions that were initiated by the stored
procedure have completed because the error was detected at the end of the execution of the stored procedure.
Programmer response: Take the action that corresponds to the reason-code value:
0 Modify the content of stored procedure procedure-name to not define result set cursors as scrollable.
1 Make sure that fetches performed by the stored procedure do not cause the server to return XML columns
as binary XML data.
SQLSTATE: 560B3
-20127 VALUE SPECIFIED ON FETCH STATEMENT FOR ABSOLUTE OR RELATIVE IS TOO LARGE FOR DRDA
Explanation: The value that was specified after ABSOLUTE or RELATIVE on a FETCH statement is larger than 64
bits. DRDA limits this specification to 64 bits.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Modify the scroll specification on the FETCH statement.
SQLSTATE: 54051
-20129 LOCAL SPECIAL REGISTER IS NOT VALID AS USED
Explanation: An attempt was made to reference a special register, but the syntax was invalid for the specified
special register.
The CURRENT PACKAGE PATH special register, or a local special register such as CURRENT SERVER or CURRENT
PACKAGESET cannot be referenced in an assignment statement (SET or VALUES INTO) where the special register is
part of an expression in the source value, or where multiple source values are being assigned to multiple targets.
The only valid uses of these special registers in a SET host-variable statement or VALUES INTO statement are:
v SET :hv= CURRENT SERVER;
v SET :hv= CURRENT PACKAGESET;
v SET :hv= CURRENT PACKAGE PATH;
v VALUES CURRENT SERVER INTO :hv;
v VALUES CURRENT PACKAGESET INTO :hv;
v VALUES CURRENT PACKAGE PATH INTO :hv;
These restrictions apply only when the reference to the special register appears outside of the body of a native SQL
procedure or an SQL scalar function.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the statement in one of the following ways:
v Do not use the special register in an expression as the source value of a SET or VALUES INTO statement.
v Do not assign multiple values to multiple special registers in a SET or VALUES INTO statement.
SQLSTATE: 560B5
Severity: 8 (error)
-20142 SEQUENCE sequence-name CANNOT BE USED AS SPECIFIED
Explanation: The sequence was referenced in a context in which it cannot be used.
sequence-name
The name of the sequence.
The sequence was an invalid reference to a system-generated sequence object. The sequence was generated by the
system for one of the following column types: catalog, identity, or DB2_GENERATED_DOCID_FOR_XML. These
sequences cannot be referenced in:
v An ALTER SEQUENCE statement
v A DROP SEQUENCE statement
v A COMMENT statement to specify a comment for a sequence
v A GRANT or REVOKE statement that references the sequence
v A NEXT VALUE or PREVIOUS VALUE expression.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Specify the name of a user-defined sequence object in this context.
SQLSTATE: 428FB
-20143 THE ENCRYPTION OR DECRYPTION FUNCTION FAILED, BECAUSE THE ENCRYPTION PASSWORD VALUE IS NOT SET
Explanation: The ENCRYPTION PASSWORD value is not set.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Issue the SET ENCRYPTION PASSWORD statement to set the ENCRYPTION PASSWORD
value. The length of the PASSWORD must be a minimum of 6 bytes and a maximum of 127 bytes.
SQLSTATE: 51039
-20144 THE ENCRYPTION IS INVALID BECAUSE THE LENGTH OF THE PASSWORD WAS LESS THAN 6 BYTES OR GREATER THAN 127 BYTES
Explanation: The data must be encrypted with a password length between 6 and 127 bytes.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Ensure that your password length is between 6 and 127 bytes in length.
SQLSTATE: 428FC
-20146 THE DECRYPTION FAILED. THE DATA IS NOT ENCRYPTED
Explanation: The data must be encrypted before it is decrypted.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Ensure that the data being decrypted has been encrypted using the ENCRYPT_TDES
built-in-function.
SQLSTATE: 428FE
-20147 THE ENCRYPTION FUNCTION FAILED. MULTIPLE PASS ENCRYPTION IS NOT SUPPORTED
Explanation: Data that has already been encrypted, cannot be encrypted again.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.

SQLSTATE: 55048
-20148 A RETURN STATEMENT DOES NOT EXIST OR WAS NOT INVOKED DURING THE EXECUTION OF ROUTINE routine-name WITH SPECIFIC NAME specific-name.
Explanation: The SQL function must contain at least one RETURN statement and a RETURN statement must be
processed when the function is invoked.
routine-name
The name of the routine
specific-name
The specific function name, which is unique within the schema
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Ensure that a RETURN statement is executed when the function is invoked.
SQLSTATE: 429BD
-20163 HEXADECIMAL CONSTANT GX IS NOT ALLOWED
Explanation: A hexadecimal graphic string constant, GX, was used in a statement when one of the following two
conditions was true:
v The MIXED DATA installation option is set to NO.
v The application encoding scheme is UNICODE.
v The GX constant was specified as a column default value in a WITH DEFAULT clause.
v The GX constant was specified as a limit key value in an ENDING AT clause.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If your data is not graphic, use an X hexadecimal constant instead of a GX constant. If your
MIXED DATA installation option is set to NO, contact your system administrator to set up the installation options
properly for use with the GX constant. If your application encoding scheme is UNICODE, use a UX hexadecimal
constant instead of GX.
SQLSTATE: 560B9
-20165 AN SQL DATA CHANGE STATEMENT WITHIN A FROM CLAUSE IS NOT ALLOWED IN THE CONTEXT IN WHICH IT WAS SPECIFIED
Explanation: An SQL data change statement cannot be specified in the FROM clause in specific contexts.
The SQL data change statement must be the only table-reference in the FROM clause that is used in:
v the outer fullselect of a SELECT statement (a subselect)
v a SELECT INTO statement
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the statement so that the SQL data change statement within a FROM clause is used
in a supported context or is the only table-reference in the FROM clause.
SQLSTATE: 428FL
-20166 AN SQL DATA CHANGE STATEMENT WITHIN A SELECT SPECIFIED A VIEW view-name WHICH IS NOT A SYMMETRIC VIEW OR COULD NOT HAVE BEEN DEFINED AS A SYMMETRIC VIEW
Explanation: The target view of the SQL data change statement within a SELECT statement must be defined WITH
CASCADED CHECK OPTION, or the fullselect in the view definition (or the fullselect of a view definition of a
referenced view) must be able to be defined using WITH CASCADED CHECK OPTION.
A symmetric view is a view defined implicitly or explicitly with the WITH CASCADED CHECK OPTION.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Do not use the SQL data change statement within a SELECT with the specified view.
SQLSTATE: 428FM
-20177 SET DATA TYPE CLAUSE ON ALTER TABLE SPECIFIED FLOATING POINT, BUT THIS CHANGE IS DISALLOWED
Explanation: The SET DATA TYPE clause of an ALTER TABLE statement specified floating point as the new data
type. However, there is an existing unique index or constraint that is defined on the column. This type of change is
not allowed when unique indexes or constraints are defined on the column to be changed.
Programmer response: Change the statement to specify a different compatible data type, and resubmit the
statement.
SQLSTATE: 530A1
-20178 VIEW view-name ALREADY HAS AN INSTEAD OF operation TRIGGER DEFINED
Explanation: The view view-name already has an INSTEAD OF trigger defined for the indicated operation (UPDATE,
DELETE, INSERT). Only one INSTEAD OF trigger can be defined for each operation on the view.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The INSTEAD OF trigger was not created.
Programmer response: If a new INSTEAD OF trigger is required, drop the existing trigger and then create the new
trigger.
SQLSTATE: 428FP
-20179 THE INSTEAD OF TRIGGER CANNOT BE CREATED BECAUSE THE VIEW view-name IS DEFINED USING THE WITH CHECK OPTION
Explanation: An INSTEAD OF trigger cannot be defined on a symmetric view, which is a view defined using WITH
CHECK OPTION. It also cannot be defined on a view on which a symmetric view has been defined directly or
indirectly. The view view-name might be the target view of the INSTEAD OF trigger, or it might be a view that
depends directly or indirectly on the target view of the trigger.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The INSTEAD OF trigger was not created.
Programmer response: The INSTEAD OF trigger cannot be defined on the view unless the symmetric view is
replaced by a view that is not symmetric. The view has to be dropped and re-created in order to allow an INSTEAD
OF trigger.
SQLSTATE: 428FQ
-20180 COLUMN column-name IN TABLE table-name CANNOT BE ALTERED AS SPECIFIED
Explanation: The column could not be altered.
column-name
The name of the column.
table-name
The name of the table that contains the column.
Possible reasons for this error include a violation of one of the following restrictions:
v ALTER COLUMN cannot be specified in an ALTER TABLE statement if any of the following conditions are true:
¨C The table is defined with DATA CAPTURE CHANGES.
¨C The column is involved in a referential integrity constraint (either as part of the parent key or foreign key).
¨C The column is involved in an extended index definition.
¨C The column has a field procedure defined.
¨C The column is an identity column or a row change timestamp column.
¨C The column is a LOB column that is referenced in an expression-based index, and the change would reduce the
inline length of the column.
¨C The table is defined as a history table or system-period temporal table.
¨C The column is defined as ROW BEGIN, ROW END, or TRANSACTION START ID.
¨C The column is involved in a hash key definition.
v ALTER COLUMN cannot be specified in an ALTER TABLE statement with either a SET NOT NULL or SET DATA
TYPE clause if the column is defined as part of a period definition.
v ALTER COLUMN cannot be specified in an ALTER TABLE statement with a DROP DEFAULT or SET DATA TYPE
clause if both of the following conditions are true:
¨C The table is defined with DATA CAPTURE CHANGES.
¨C The subsystem parameter RESTRICT_ALT_COL_FOR_DCC is set to YES.
v SET DATA TYPE cannot be specified in an ALTER TABLE statement if any of the following conditions are true:
¨C The table is a materialized query table.
¨C The table has an edit procedure or valid procedure.
¨C The column is involved in an extended index definition.
¨C VARBINARY was specified as the target data type and the column is defined with the following attributes:
- As CHAR FOR BIT DATA, VARCHAR FOR BIT DATA, or BINARY
- With the DESC attribute in an index
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Perform one of the following actions:
v Change the name of the column in the statement to a column that can be altered.
v Drop and re-create the table with the necessary attributes.
v If the column is used in an index that contains an expression, drop the index and alter the column with the
necessary attributes. Then, re-create the index.

method, or correct the specified procedure or function signature.
SQLSTATE: 46007
-20204 THE USER-DEFINED FUNCTION OR PROCEDURE routine-name WAS UNABLE TO MAP TO A SINGLE JAVA METHOD
Explanation: A CREATE or ALTER FUNCTION or PROCEDURE statement for routine-name specified a Java method
in the EXTERNAL NAME clause that cannot be used. The EXTERNAL NAME clause did not contain a matching
Java method, or contained more than one matching Java method.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: The EXTERNAL NAME clause of the identified function or procedure must be altered to
uniquely identify a valid Java method for the routine, or the Java class must be changed to have a single method
with the specified or implicit signature.
SQLSTATE: 46008
-20207 THE INSTALL OR REMOVE OF jar-name SPECIFIED THE USE OF A DEPLOYMENT DESCRIPTOR.
Explanation: The DEPLOY or UNDEPLOY parameter of the install or remove jar procedure for jar-name was
non-zero. Use of deployment descriptors is not supported, and this parameter must be zero.

-20210 THE SQL STATEMENT CANNOT BE EXECUTED BECAUSE IT WAS PRECOMPILED AT A LEVEL THAT IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE CURRENT VALUE OF THE ENCODING BIND OPTION OR SPECIAL REGISTER
Explanation: The SQL statement was precompiled at a level prior to Version 7, but the current value of the
ENCODING bind option or special register does not represent the system EBCDIC CCSIDs. The information that is
necessary to execute the SQL statement is unavailable for processing, and the SQL statement cannot be successfully
completed. Additional processing of the SQL statement is terminated.
An application that was precompiled prior to DB2 Version 7 may not be bound, either implicitly or explicitly, with an
ENCODING bind option of anything other than ENCODING(EBCDIC) or ENCODING(ccsid) where ccsid represents
the system EBCDIC CCSID. If the value of MIXED DATA for the system is YES, then ccsid must be the default
EBCDIC mixed CCSID. Otherwise, ccsid must be the default EBCDIC single byte CCSID.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: To correct the situation, you can:
v Precompile the program again using the current precompiler and reissue the BIND command
v Reissue the BIND command using ENCODING(EBCDIC) or ENCODING(ccsid) where ccsid represents the system
EBCDIC CCSID.

Programmer response: Correct the failing statement. If the failing statement is CREATE VIEW, specify the ORDER
BY or FETCH FIRST clause in SQL statements that refer to the view instead.
SQLSTATE: 428FJ
-20212 USER-DEFINED ROUTINE name ENCOUNTERED AN EXCEPTION ATTEMPTING TO LOAD JAVA CLASS class-name FROM JAR jar-name. ORIGINAL EXCEPTION: exception-string
Explanation: A Java exception occurred while DB2 was trying to load a Java class. The error can occur when
loading the class that is identified in the EXTERNAL NAME clause, or a referenced class.
The error can also occur when accessing the installed JAR identified in the EXTERNAL NAME clause, or an installed
JAR in the Java path of the installed JAR that referenced this class. Possible reasons why this message could occur
include:
v A class was not found.
v An I/O error occurred when the class loader reads the JAR file.
v An SQL error occurred when the BLOB that contains the JAR file from the DB2 catalog is being read by the class
loader.

Explanation: A conversion error occurred during the conversion of a string to a different coded character set.
from-ccsid
identifies the coded character set of the string to be converted.
to-ccsid identifies the coded character set to which it must be converted.
error-code
indicates the type of error as defined as follows:
v 8 - Length exception (for example, expansion required for PC MIXED data exceeds the maximum length
of the string).
v 20 -Conversion procedure error (for example, an error during Unicode/390 stage 2 conversions or an exit
set the length control field of the string to an invalid value).
v 24 - The conversion services have not been setup correctly or the conversion is not supported.
dbid.obid
gives the database id and the table obid of the object with the conversion error. This could be either the
target or the source of the conversion.
column-number
gives the column number of the failing object. This could be either the target or the source of the conversion.
csect-name
describes the reason codes returned from DB2. Reason codes returned from DB2 begin with 'DSN' and
identify the context in which the conversion was requested. Values other than those that start DSN' are
returned from other DB2 platforms and are described in the documentation for the platform.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If the error-code is 24 and the conversion request is correct, you might need to set up
character conversion.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.

-20252 DIAGNOSTICS AREA FULL. NO MORE ERRORS CAN BE RECORDED FOR THE NOT ATOMIC STATEMENT
Explanation: A statement with the NOT ATOMIC CONTINUE ON SQLEXCEPTION clause encountered more errors
than could be recorded in the diagnostics area. NOT ATOMIC processing with CONTINUE ON SQLEXCEPTION
allows DB2 to continue processing a statement after one or more errors is encountered. DB2 will continue processing
until it is no longer able to record errors in the diagnostic area (See the GET DIAGNOSTICS statement for
information on how to retrieve error information). When DB2 is no longer able to record error diagnostics, processing
of the statement is terminated, and this error is returned.
System action: The statement is terminated.
Programmer response: Analyze the warning and error conditions using the GET DIAGNOSTICS statement.
Determine how to change the statement to eliminate or reduce the number of warnings and errors. It is up to the
programmer to determine if a ROLLBACK or COMMIT should be issued for this message. Either is appropriate
depending on the application logic.

Programmer response: Drop the INSTEAD OF trigger, and reissue the statement.
SQLSTATE: 428G3
-20258 INVALID USE OF INPUT SEQUENCE ORDERING
Explanation: The ORDER BY clause specifies INPUT SEQUENCE, and the FROM clause of the fullselect does not
specify an INSERT or MERGE statement. If the input data is not specified using a VALUES clause, or a fullselect with
an ORDER BY clause on the outermost fullselect, then the ORDER BY INPUT SEQUENCE clause has no effect.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Specify a valid sort key or ensure that the input to the INSERT is a VALUES clause or an
ordered fullselect.
SQLSTATE: 428G4
-20260 THE ASSIGNMENT CLAUSE OF THE UPDATE OPERATION AND THE VALUES CLAUSE OF THE INSERT OPERATION MUST SPECIFY AT LEAST ONE COLUMN THAT IS NOT AN INCLUDE COLUMN
Explanation: The SQL data change statement specified INCLUDE columns, and the only assignments are made to
INCLUDE columns. At least one of the assignments in a data change statement must be to a column of the target of
the data change statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the statement to specify an assignment to a column of the target of the UPDATE
operation.
SQLSTATE: 428G5
-20264 FOR TABLE table-name, primary-auth-id WITH SECURITY LABEL primary-auth-id-seclabel IS NOT AUTHORIZED TO PERFORM operation ON A ROW WITH SECURITY LABEL row-seclabel. THE RECORD IDENTIFIER (RID) OF THIS ROW IS rid-number.
Explanation: primary-auth-id attempted an MLS READWRITE operation on a row without having the proper
Multilevel Security (MLS) authorization. The RID identifies this row.
The RID might be *N when a RID identifier is not available for the row.
System action: The operation that was attempted could not be performed.
Programmer response: If this user is authorized to perform this operation, ensure that this user has been properly
defined to MLS. If the row data needs to be viewed, use DSN1PRINT.
In the case of a view or cursor, where the primary authorization ID is able to access more rows than it can update or
delete, you can add the WHERE clause to limit the rows accessed, based on the security label of the primary
authorization ID. The security label can be retrieved using GETVARIABLE(SYSIBM.SECLABEL).
SQLSTATE: 429BI
-20265 SECURITY LABEL IS reason FOR primary-auth-id
Explanation: User primary-auth-id has a blank security label, or the security label is not accessible. reason is BLANK
or INACCESSIBLE.
System action: The operation that was attempted could not be performed.

-20289 INVALID STRING UNIT unit SPECIFIED FOR FUNCTION function-name
Explanation: The statement invoked a built-in function using a string unit that is not valid with the type of data
that is provided to the function. This can occur for the following reasons:
v Binary data was specified with unit. CODEUNITS16, or CODEUNITS32 are not valid with binary string data.
v Graphic data was specified with OCTETS as the string length unit. OCTETS is not valid with graphic data.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the invocation of the function to remove the invalid string length unit or change it
to a valid unit for the data type being processed.
SQLSTATE: 428GC
-20295 THE EXECUTION OF A BUILT IN FUNCTION function RESULTED IN AN ERROR REASON CODE reason-code
Explanation: The execution of a built-in function (BIF), function, resulted in an error. The reason code, reason-code,
further explains the reason for the error:
4 A string longer than allowed returned as a result of an UPPER or LOWER function execution. Correct the
usage of the function by using a varying-length string long enough to contain the expanded result.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the use of the built-in function, function.
SQLSTATE: 22531
-20300 THE LIST OF COLUMNS SPECIFIED FOR THE clause CLAUSE IS NOT ALLOWED IN COMBINATION WITH THE LIST OF COLUMNS FOR THE PARTITIONING KEY FOR THE TABLE.
Explanation: The list of columns that was specified for a clause is not valid when used with the list of columns of
the partitioning key for the table.
clause The clause that was specified
When the PARTITION BY RANGE and ORGANIZE BY KEY SEQUENCE clauses are used on the same table and the
column list for the PARTITION BY RANGE clause includes a single column, the hash key must have that column as
its first hash key column
When the PARTITION BY RANGE and ORGANIZE BY HASH clauses are used on the same table, the column list for
the PARTITION BY RANGE clause must be identical to or be a subset of the column list for the ORGANIZE BY
HASH clause and the column names must be in the same order.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Change the list of columns in the appropriate clause or clauses.
SQLSTATE: 428HK
-20304 INVALID INDEX DEFINITION INVOLVING AN XMLPATTERN CLAUSE OR A COLUMN OF DATA TYPE XML. REASON CODE = reason-code
Explanation: A column defined with a data type of XML is included (or missing) in the columns for the index. The
index definition is not valid for one of the following possible reason codes:
2 An XMLPATTERN clause is present but multiple index columns are specified.
4 An XMLPATTERN clause is present but the single index column specified is not defined with data type
XML.
5 The path expression specified for the XMLPATTERN Clause does not start with a '/' or '//'.
6 The pattern expression does not have a name test or kind test following the '/'.
7 The pattern expression uses an unsupported axis in an axis step. Only forward axes child, attribute,
descendant, self and descendant-or-self are supported.
8 The pattern expression specifies an invalid kind test or some syntax that is not a valid name test or kind test
supported in a pattern expression.
9 The pattern expression specifies a predicate (an expression enclosed in square brackets). Predicates are not
supported in a pattern expression of an XMLPATTERN clause.
10 The pattern expression includes XQuery syntax that is not supported in an XMLPATTERN clause and is not
specifically covered by one of the other reason codes.
11 On a z/OS database server, the pattern expression exceeds the limit of 50 steps if the pattern expression
does not contain a function, or 44 steps if it contains a function.
12 The argument of the function in the pattern expression does not conform to the required syntax, or the
index data type is not correct.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Modify the statement based on the reason specified by the reason-code. Use one of the following
suggestions to modify the statement:
2 If the index is intended as a key for XML data, ensure that only one column defined with a data type of
XML is specified. Otherwise, remove the XMLPATTERN clause.
4 Either remove the XMLPATTERN clause or change the specified column to a single column defined with a
data type of XML.
5 Ensure that the pattern expression begins with '/' or '//'. The XQuery syntax for which '/' or '//' is an
abbreviation is not supported in the XMLPATTERN clause of the CREATE INDEX statement.
6 Add a name test or kind test following the '/' in the pattern expression.
7 Remove any reverse axes from the pattern expression. For example, 'parent::' must not be used as an axes in
a pattern expression.
8 Check the pattern expression for kind tests or name tests that do not match the syntax specification of the
XMLPATTERN clause of the CREATE INDEX statement. Correct or remove unsupported syntax.
9 Remove any predicates from the pattern expression in the XMLPATTERN clause.
10 Change the pattern expression to remove any syntax that is not valid according to the syntax specification of
the XMLPATTERN clause of the CREATE INDEX statement. If the pattern expression includes an asterisk
character (*), ensure that the name tests in the pattern expression correctly use the wildcard. If used with a
Qname, there must be a colon before or after the wildcard character, otherwise it is considered a
multiplication operator. Remove any attempt to use the asterisk as a multiplication operator from the pattern
expression. You should also ensure that the XMLPATTERN clause does not include other XQuery operators,
XQuery functions or XQuery FLWR (for, let, where, return) expressions.
11 Reduce the number of steps in the pattern expression. If the value that is to be indexed in the XML
documents is longer than 50 steps when the pattern does not contain a function or longer than 44 steps
when the pattern does contain a function, the index cannot be created.
12 Check the argument of the function in the pattern expression that does not conform to the required syntax
of the XMLPATTERN clause of the CREATE INDEX statement, and check the index data type. Correct or
remove unsupported syntax, or modify the index data type.
SQLSTATE: 429BS
-20305 AN XML VALUE CANNOT BE INSERTED OR UPDATED BECAUSE OF AN ERROR DETECTED WHEN INSERTING OR UPDATING THE INDEX IDENTIFIED BY index-id ON TABLE table-name.  REASON CODE = reason-code
Explanation: The insertion or update of an XML value failed during insertion or update of the specified index. The
statement cannot proceed, and the table and index remain unchanged.
index-id The index ID.
table-name
The name of the table.
reason-code
A numeric value that indicates the reason for the failure.
The schema data type and schema identifier are not applicable for all reason codes. See specific reason codes
for details. The error occurred because of one of the following possible reason codes:
1 One or more XML node values in an XML value being inserted or updated exceeds a length
constraint imposed by the identified index. The index on an XML column is defined to use the SQL
type VARCHAR with a specific length specified. The length of one or more XMLPATTERN result
values exceeds the user-specified length constraint for the VARCHAR data type.
4 At least one XML node value is a valid XML value that cannot be cast to the index data type for
the identified index. That value is outside the supported range of values.
6 One or more XML node values are XML values, but those XML values span multiple records. DB2
cannot create an index key on an XML value that spans multiple records.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Use the following query to determine the table name and index ID:
SELECT NAME as IndexName,
TBNAME as TableName
FROM SYSIBM.SYSINDEXES
WHERE index-id;
Take the action indicated by the reason code:
1 Use the XML pattern information to identify the set of matching XML nodes to inspect to determine which
string values are beyond the limit of the length constraint specified by the index.
4 Use the XML pattern information to identify the set of matching XML nodes to inspect and compare against
the data type specified for the identified index. Determine which node values exceed the range of values
supported by DB2 for the index data type.
6 Use the XML pattern information to identify the set of matching XML nodes to inspect to determine which
values might be spanning multiple records. Generally, large values might lead to multiple records. Large
values might arise from a single large text node, or an element node with many descendant text nodes.
SQLSTATE: 23525
-20306 AN INDEX ON AN XML COLUMN CANNOT BE CREATED BECAUSE OF AN ERROR DETECTED WHEN INSERTING THE XML VALUES INTO THE INDEX. REASON CODE = reason-code
Explanation: The statement cannot proceed and the table remains unchanged. The schema data type and schema
identifier are not applicable for all reason codes. See specific reason codes for details. The creation of the index on an
XML column failed for one of the following possible reason codes:
1 One or more XML node values in an XML value being inserted or updated exceeds a length constraint
imposed by the index that is being created. The index on an XML column is defined to use the SQL type
VARCHAR with a specific length specified. The length of one or more XMLPATTERN result values exceeds
the user-specified length constraint for the VARCHAR data type.
4 One or more XML node values is a valid XML value but cannot be cast to the index data type for the index
being created because of DB2 limitations. DB2 does not support the entire range of XML values.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Determine the XMLPATTERN clause from the index definition.
1 Use the XML pattern information to identify the set of matching XML nodes to inspect to determine which
string values are beyond the limit of the length constraint specified by the index.
4 Use the XMLPATTERN information to identify the set of matching XML nodes to inspect and compare
against the data type specified for the index being created. Determine which node values exceed the range
of values supported by DB2 for the index data type.
SQLSTATE: 23526
-20310 THE REMOVE OF jar-name1 FAILED, AS IT IS IN USE BY jar-name2
Explanation: The JAR being removed exists in the JAVA path of another JAR.
jar-name1
The JAR being removed.
jar-name2
A JAR file that contains a JAVA path with a reference to jar-name1.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Remove the dependency by altering the JAVA path for JARjar-name2 so it does not include the
reference to jar-name1.
SQLSTATE: 4600C
-20311 THE VALUE PROVIDED FOR THE NEW JAVA PATH IS ILLEGAL
Explanation: The Java path cannot be resolved for one of the following reasons:
v The provided value for the Java path is not valid. The value must be either a blank or a zero-length string.
v The Java path does not conform to its required syntax.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Based on the specific error, correct the Java path by using one of the following solutions:
v Change the specified value to a blank or a zero-length string.
v Change the Java path to conform to its required syntax.
SQLSTATE: 4600D
-20312 THE ALTER OF JAR jar-id FAILED BECAUSE THE SPECIFIED PATH REFERENCES ITSELF
Explanation: You attempted to alter the JAR jar-id to contain a JAVA path that references the jar-id. A JAR cannot
have a path that contains a reference to itself.
jar-id The JAR file that is being altered. The reference to the jar-id also appears in a specified Java path.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Correct the specified JAVA path value so that it does not reference the JAR that is being altered.
SQLSTATE: 4600E
-20313 DEBUG MODE OPTION FOR ROUTINE routine-name CANNOT BE CHANGED
Explanation: The routine, routine-name, was originally created with DISABLE DEBUG MODE. A routine created with
this attribute cannot be changed to either ALLOW DEBUG MODE or DISALLOW DEBUG MODE with an ALTER
statement.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: To change the setting of the DEBUG MODE option, drop and re-create the routine with the correct
option.
SQLSTATE: 55058
-20314 THE PARAMETER LIST (OR AN OPTION) DOES NOT MATCH THE PARAMETER LIST (OR OPTION) FOR ALL OTHER VERSIONS OF ROUTINE routine-name
Explanation: An inconsistency exists between the parameters for the currently active version of the routine and
other versions of the routine. This error can be issued for any of the following reasons:
v The number of parameters, data types, CCSID specifications, and character data attributes (FOR BIT, SBCS, or
MIXED DATA) in the parameter list must be the same as the attributes of the corresponding parameters of the
currently active version of the routine and all of the other existing versions of the routine.
v The data type, CCSID specification, and character data attributes (FOR BIT, SBCS, or MIXED DATA) for the
RETURNS parameter must be the same as the attributes of the RETURNS parameter of the currently active version
of the routine and all of the other existing versions of the routine.
v An ALTER PROCEDURE statement was specified with the PARAMETER CCSID clause with a value that is
different from the value determined when the procedure was initially created.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Correct the specification of the parameter list or RETURNS clause, or change or remove the
PARAMETER CCSID clause.
SQLSTATE: 428GH
-20315 THE CURRENTLY ACTIVE VERSION FOR ROUTINE routine-name (routine-type) CANNOT BE DROPPED
Explanation: The ALTER statement for the SQL routine specified a DROP VERSION clause that identified the
currently active version to be dropped. You cannot drop the active version of a routine.
routine-name
The name of the routine.
routine-type
The type of routine.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: To drop all of the versions of the routine, drop the SQL routine without identifying a particular
version.
To drop the currently active version and make a different version active, complete the following steps:
1. Issue the ALTER statement for the SQL routine with the ACTIVATE VERSION clause. This statement changes
which version is active.
2. Issue the ALTER statement for the SQL routine with a DROP VERSION clause. This statement identifies and
drops the previously active version.

-20327 THE DEPTH OF AN XML DOCUMENT EXCEEDS THE LIMIT OF 128 LEVELS
Explanation: An XML document that is being parsed or validated, or an XML value that is being stored, is nested
too deep.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: For a document or constructed XML value, reduce the number of levels of elements and attributes
that are used.
SQLSTATE: 54058
-20328 THE DOCUMENT WITH TARGET NAMESPACE namespace AND SCHEMA LOCATION location HAS ALREADY BEEN ADDED FOR THE XML SCHEMA IDENTIFIED BY schema name
Explanation: This error can occur while invoking the XSR_ADDSCHEMADOC stored procedure. There cannot be
two documents with the same targetnamespace and schemalocation within an XML schema.
System action: The operation fails with this SQLCODE.
Programmer response: Change either the namespace or schemalocation of the document that is being added.
SQLSTATE: 42749
-20329 THE COMPLETION CHECK FOR THE XML SCHEMA FAILED BECAUSE ONE OR MORE XML SCHEMA DOCUMENTS IS MISSING. ONE MISSING XML SCHEMA DOCUMENT IS IDENTIFIED BY uri-type AS uri
Explanation: The XML schema registration completion processing determined that more than one XML schema
document is required for a complete XML schema. The processing also determined that at least one XML schema
document is missing from the XML schema repository. The missing XML schema document is identified by the uri
type with value uri. The reference to the missing XML schema document may be included in one of the XML schema
documents that is defined for the XML schema.
System action: The invocation of SYSPROC.XSR_COMPLETE fails with this SQLCODE.
Programmer response: Add any missing XML schema documents to the XML schema repository, and then re-invoke
SYSPROC.XSR_COMPLETE.
SQLSTATE: 428GI
-20330 THE object-type IDENTIFIED BY XML uri-type1 uri1 AND XML uri-type2 uri2 IS NOT FOUND IN THE XML SCHEMA REPOSITORY
Explanation: The processing of the statement or command required the use of an XML SCHEMA from the XML
schema repository that could not be found. uri-type1 is NAMESPACE and uri-type2 is LOCATION. If either value was
null on the request, the corresponding uri1 or uri2 is the empty string.
object-type
The type of object.
uri-type1
NAMESPACE.
uri1 The URI that corresponds to the namespace. If uri-type1 was null on the request, uri1 is an empty string.
uri-type2
LOCATION.
uri2 The URI that corresponds to the location. If uri-type2 was null on the request, uri2 is an empty string.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Add the missing XML schema to the XML schema repository, and reissue the statement.
SQLSTATE: 4274A 25532
-20331 THE XML COMMENT VALUE string IS NOT VALID
Explanation: The XML comment cannot contain two adjacent hyphens and cannot end in a hyphen.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Ensure the value for the XML comment is valid.
SQLSTATE: 2200S
-20332 THE XML PROCESSING INSTRUCTION VALUE string IS NOT VALID
Explanation: The XML processing instruction must not contain the substring "?>".
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Ensure the value for the XML processing instruction is valid.
SQLSTATE: 2200T
-20335 MORE THAN ONE xsrobject-type EXISTS IDENTIFIED BY XML uri-type1 uri1 AND uri-type2 uri2 EXISTS IN THE XML SCHEMA REPOSITORY.
Explanation: There is more than one registered XML schema that matches the URIs used to identify it.
xsrobject-type
The type of object.
uri-type1
Either NAMESPACE or null.
uri1 The XML schema target namespace. If uri-type1 was null on the request, uri1 is an empty string.
uri-type2
Either LOCATION or null.
uri2 The XML schema location. If uri-type2 was null on the request, uri2 is an empty string.
System action: The invocation of DSN_XMLVALIDATE fails with this SQLCODE.
Programmer response: Use the unique XML schema ID to identify the XML schema.
SQLSTATE: 22533
-20338 THE DATA TYPE OF EITHER THE SOURCE OR TARGET OPERAND OF AN XMLCAST SPECIFICATION MUST BE XML
Explanation: The XMLCAST specification must have one operand that has the data type XML. The XMLCAST
operation can be from one the following:
v an XML type value to an SQL type value
v from an SQL type value to and XML type value
The XMLCAST specification also accepts having both the source and target operands as XML, but if you specify the
source and target operands as XML, then no actual casting operation is performed.
System action: The expression cannot be processed.
Programmer response: If both operands are SQL data types other than XML, then use the CAST specification.
Otherwise, change the XMLCAST specification so that at least one operand is the XML data type.
SQLSTATE: 42815
-20339 XML SCHEMA name IS NOT IN THE CORRECT STATE TO PERFORM OPERATION operation
Explanation: The operation operation cannot be performed on the XML schema identified by name because it is not
in the correct state. For example, the XML schema has already been completed and the operation is attempting to
add additional XML schema documents.
System action: operation is failed with this SQLCODE.
Programmer response: If the schema has not yet been completed, invoke SYSPROC. XSR_COMPLETE and try the
operation again. If the schema has already been completed and needs to be updated, you must first remove it or
register it using a different name.
SQLSTATE: 55063
-20340 XML SCHEMA xmlschema-name INCLUDES AT LEAST ONE XML SCHEMA DOCUMENT IN NAMESPACE namespace THAT IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE OTHER XML SCHEMA DOCUMENTS
Explanation: The XML schema identified by identifier xmlschema-name includes multiple XML schema documents.
At least one of these XML schema documents is not connected to the other XML schema documents registered to this
XML schema.
System action: The XSR_COMPLETE call fails with this SQLCODE.
Programmer response: Correct the XML schema documents, or add a new XML schema document, so that all XML
schema documents in an XML schema are connected using import, include, or redefine, beginning from the primary
schema document. Use SYSPROC.XSR_REMOVE to remove the invalid schema and re-invoke the XSR stored
procedures to register it with the corrected and/or new XML schema documents.
SQLSTATE: 22534
-20345 THE XML VALUE IS NOT A WELL-FORMED DOCUMENT WITH A SINGLE ROOT ELEMENT
Explanation: DB2 attempted to use an XML value that was not well-formed.
Well-formed XML is required when:
v Storing an XML value into a table.
v Processing an XML value that has been returned from a remote site within an SQL procedural language stored
procedure.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Modify the XML value so that it is well-formed with a single root element.
SQLSTATE: 2200L
-20353 AN OPERATION INVOLVING COMPARISON CANNOT USE OPERAND name DEFINED AS DATA TYPE type-name
Explanation: The use of the value identified by name defined as data type type-name is not permitted in an operation
that involves comparisons. This error can be returned for an expression that results in a type-name data type in the
following contexts:
v A SELECT DISTINCT statement.
v A GROUP BY clause.
v An ORDER BY clause.
v An aggregate function with DISTINCT.
v A SELECT or VALUES statement of a set operator other than UNION ALL.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: The requested operation on the data type type-name is not supported. You can change the
data type of the value to a data type that is supported using a cast or some other function.
SQLSTATE: 42818
-20354 INVALID SPECIFICATION OF A ROW CHANGE TIMESTAMP COLUMN FOR TABLE table-name
Explanation: The specification of a row change timestamp column is invalid. The specification is invalid because a
row change timestamp column cannot be:
v A column of a foreign key.
v A column of a partitioning key.
v Defined for a temporary table.
The specification might also be invalid because a row change timestamp column cannot have a FIELDPROC defined
for it.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Correct the syntax and resubmit the statement.
SQLSTATE: 429BV
-20355 THE STATEMENT COULD NOT BE PROCESSED BECAUSE ONE OR MORE IMPLICITLY CREATED OBJECTS ARE INVOLVED reason-code
Explanation: The statement failed for one of the following reasons, indicated by the reason-code:
1 The statement attempted to create a table or a table space within a database that was implicitly created by
DB2.
2 The statement attempted to define a new column (using CREATE or ALTER TABLE) as LONG VARCHAR
or LONG VARGRAPHIC, but the associated table space was implicitly created by DB2.
3 The statement attempted to create an auxiliary table or auxiliary index because these objects have already
been implicitly created by DB2.
4 The statement attempted to drop a LOB table space, auxiliary table, or auxiliary index that was implicitly
created by DB2.
5 The statement attempted to alter an implicitly created hash overflow index, either by adding the clustering
option, by adding columns, or by making it padded.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Change the statement to refer to an object that is not involved with implicitly created objects.
SQLSTATE: 429BW
-20356 THE TABLE WITH DBID = dbid AND OBID = obid CANNOT BE TRUNCATED BECAUSE DELETE TRIGGERS EXIST FOR THE TABLE, OR THE TABLE IS THE PARENT TABLE IN A REFERENTIAL CONSTRAINT
Explanation: The TRUNCATE statement could not be processed for one of the following reasons:
v The TRUNCATE statement would result in the activation of DELETE triggers, but the statement specified
RESTRICT WHEN DELETE TRIGGERS, either implicitly or explicitly. This can occur when enabled DELETE
triggers exist for the table to be truncated, and the result of the TRUNCATE statement would activate the triggers.
v The table to be truncated is the parent table of a child table, regardless of whether the child table contains rows or
not, that are in a referential constraint.
dbid.obid Gives the database id and the table obid of the object with the truncation error.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: If the statement failed because of the existence of DELETE triggers, specify the IGNORE DELETE
TRIGGERS clause on the TRUNCATE statement. If the statement failed because of referential constraints, use the
ALTER TABLE statement to drop the referential integrity constraints, and then re-issue the TRUNCATE statement.
SQLSTATE: 428GJ
-20361 AUTHORIZATION ID authorization-name IS NOT DEFINED FOR THE TRUSTED CONTEXT context-name
Explanation: authorization-name attempted to reuse a trusted connection using trusted context context-name. The
trusted context name context-name cannot be used under the authorization-name.
This error can also occur for one of the following reasons:
v The authorization ID is allowed to use the trusted context, but authentication is required and the request to switch
users did not include the authentication token.
v The authorization ID is allowed to use the trusted context , but the security label for the user is not one of the
RACF SECLABEL values defined for the user.
v The authorization ID is allowed to use the trusted context, but the trusted context is disabled.
v The system authorization ID attribute of the trusted context object associated with the trusted connection has been
changed.
v The trusted context object associated with the trusted connection has been dropped.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Establish a valid authorization ID to be associated with the trusted connection.
v If the authorization ID is valid but requires authentication, provide the authentication token.
v If the trusted context object is either disabled, dropped, or its system authorization ID is altered, then only the
authorization ID that established the trusted connection is allowed. Provide this authorization ID.
v If the authorization ID is valid but requires a RACF security label, then define the security label in RACF for the
authorization ID.
SQLSTATE: 42517
-20362 ATTRIBUTE attribute-name WITH VALUE value CANNOT BE DROPPED BECAUSE IT IS NOT PART OF THE DEFINITION OF TRUSTED CONTEXT context-name
Explanation: Attribute attribute-name was specified for a trusted context, but the trusted context is not defined with
an attribute with this name.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Remove the name of the unsupported attribute and re-issue the statement.
SQLSTATE: 4274C
-20363 ATTRIBUTE attribute-name WITH VALUE value IS NOT A UNIQUE SPECIFICATION FOR TRUSTED CONTEXT context-name
Explanation: During the create or alter of a trusted context context-name, a duplicate value was specified for the
attribute-name attribute. Attribute attribute-name was specified for the trusted context with value value, but the
combination is not unique. Each pair of attribute name and value must be unique for a trusted context.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Remove the non-unique specification of attribute-name and value and re-issue the statement.
SQLSTATE: 4274D
-20365 A SIGNALING NAN WAS ENCOUNTERED, OR AN EXCEPTION OCCURRED IN AN ARITHMETIC OPERATION OR FUNCTION INVOLVING A DECFLOAT
Explanation: A signaling NaN (sNaN) was encountered in an expression, arithmetic operation, or function. This
message could also be issued because an expression, arithmetic operation, or function involving a DECFLOAT
column or value resulted in an exception. In either case, the result is a NAN, and an error is issued.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. In the case of an INSERT, MERGE, or UPDATE operation, no
data is updated or deleted. If the statement is a cursor-controlled FETCH, then the cursor will remain open, unless
the exception occurred while processing an aggregate function. If the exception occurred while processing an
aggregate function, it is indicated by an operation-type of AGGREGATE FUNCTION. If this is the case, the cursor
will be closed. If the cursor is closed, subsequent attempts to use that cursor without first doing an OPEN for it,
receive an SQLCODE-501. If the statement was a cursor-controlled OPEN, then the cursor will remain closed.
User response: Examine the expression which prompted the warning to see if the cause of the problem can be
determined. The problem might be data-dependent, in which case you must examine the data that was being
processed at the time the error occurred.
If the arithmetic expression in error was within the SELECT list of the outer SELECT statement, then you should
include an indicator variable for all expressions in the SELECT list. This allows processing to continue so that
non-error column and expression values can be returned.
See the explanation of SQLCODE -405 for allowed ranges of numeric data types.
SQLSTATE:: 22502
-20366 TABLE WITH DBID=database-id AND OBID=object-id CANNOT BE TRUNCATED BECAUSE UNCOMMITTED UPDATES EXIST ON THE TABLE WITH 'IMMEDIATE' OPTION SPECIFIED IN THE STATEMENT
Explanation: A TRUNCATE statement was issued with the IMMEDIATE option, but the statement could not be
processed.
database-id
The database ID.
object-id
The table object ID (OBID) of the object with the truncation error.
A TRUNCATE statement with the IMMEDIATE option cannot be processed if either of the following are true:
v Any table in the same table space as the target table has uncommitted CREATE, ALTER or DROP changes.
v Any table in the same table space as the target table has uncommitted data changes.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Issue a COMMIT statement, and then issue the TRUNCATE statement with the IMMEDIATE option.
SQLSTATE: 57007

-20369 AN ALTER TRUSTED CONTEXT STATEMENT FOR context-name ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE THE LAST CONNECTION TRUST ATTRIBUTE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRUSTED CONTEXT
Explanation: An ALTER TRUSTED CONTEXT statement for context-name specified the DROP ATTRIBUTES clause
that would have resulted in removing the last connection trust attribute defined for the trusted context. This result is
not allowed.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Specify the ADD ATTRIBUTES clause to specify new values for the connection trust
attributes being removed, or, use the ALTER ATTRIBUTES clause to specify new values without needing a DROP
ATTRIBUTES clause.
SQLSTATE: 428GK
-20372 THE SYSTEM AUTHID CLAUSE OF A CREATE OR ALTER TRUSTED CONTEXT STATEMENT FOR context-name SPECIFIED authorization-name, BUT ANOTHER TRUSTED CONTEXT IS ALREADY DEFINED FOR THAT AUTHORIZATION ID.
Explanation: A CREATE or ALTER TRUSTED CONTEXT statement for context-name specified SYSTEM AUTHID
authorization-name, but this authorization ID is already defined to use a different trusted context. A system
authorization ID that is defined as the SYSTEM AUTHID for a trusted context cannot be associated with any other
trusted context as the SYSTEM AUTHID.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Change the authorization ID to be the system authorization ID for the trusted context and
reissue the CREATE or ALTER statement.
SQLSTATE: 428GL
-20373 A CREATE OR ALTER TRUSTED CONTEXT STATEMENT SPECIFIED authorization-name MORE THAN ONCE OR THE TRUSTED CONTEXT IS ALREADY DEFINED TO BE USED BY THIS AUTHORIZATION ID, PROFILE NAME, OR PUBLIC.
Explanation: The statement specified that authorization-name be allowed to use the trusted context, but cannot due to
one of the following reasons:
v The specified authorization ID, profile name, or PUBLIC is already defined to use the trusted context
v The profile name or authorization ID was specified more than once in the statement
The authorization ID, profile name, or PUBLIC must not already be allowed to use the trusted context, and, it can
only be specified once within a statement for a trusted context.
The token authorization-name might return a RACF profile name. A profile name is returned as a single token in the
following format: PROFILE: profile-name.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Complete one of the following actions based on what the error is:
v If an ALTER TRUSTED CONTEXT statement that contained an ADD USE FOR clause, and the trusted context

Explanation: The XML schema document did not process.
n Location of the error in the schema document being processed.
text Additional information describing the parsing error. This information includes the XML4J parser error codes
and text. The DB2 special register value CURRENT LOCALE_LC_CTYPE is used to determine the language
of the error message from the XML parser. If this value is not set, the default language is EN_US. Attention:
For DB2 Version 9.1 for z/OS, there is not a value for n (offset), so DB2 will return *N. In the future, if there
is a value for the location, DB2 will be able to plug it in for the first token.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
User response: Correct the problem with the XML schema document and re-issue the invocation of the
SYSPROC.XSR_COMPLETE stored procedure.
SQLSTATE: 2200M
-20409 AN XML DOCUMENT OR CONSTRUCTED XML VALUE CONTAINS A COMBINATION OF XML NODES THAT CAUSES AN INTERNAL IDENTIFIER LIMIT TO BE EXCEEDED
Explanation: An internal identifier that must be associated with each XML node of an XML value cannot be
generated because the combination of the number of levels of XML nodes and the number of children nodes within
these levels causes the identifier to overflow.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: For a document or constructed XML value, reduce the number of levels of XML nodes or the
number of children nodes especially at the deeper levels of XML nodes.
SQLSTATE: 560CG
-20410 THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN NODES OF AN XML NODE IN AN XML VALUE HAS EXCEEDED THE LIMIT NUMBER OF CHILDREN NODES
Explanation: An expression generated an XML value with an XML node that has a number of children nodes. This
number exceeds the limit of 232 -1 children nodes.
System action: The XQuery expression cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Rewrite the expression generating the XML value such that the number of children nodes
does not exceed the limit.
SQLSTATE: 560CH
-20411 A FETCH CURRENT CONTINUE OPERATION WAS REQUESTED FOR cursor-name BUT THERE IS NO PRESERVED, TRUNCATED DATA TO RETURN
Explanation: The application issued a FETCH request with the CURRENT CONTINUE clause for cursor
cursor-name, however, there is no preserved, truncated data that can be returned. One of the following errors might
have occurred:
v An operation has occurred since the previous FETCH for this cursor that caused DB2 to discard the preserved,
truncated data.
v CONTINUE was specified on the FETCH statement, but the previous FETCH for this cursor did not specify the
WITH CONTINUE clause to enable preservation of truncated data.
v The cursor is open but not positioned on a row.
v A FETCH WITH CONTINUE was executed successfully, but the LOB or XML columns were not truncated.
System action: The statement is not processed. No data is written to the output host variable referenced on the
FETCH.
Problem determination: Verify that the application has successfully completed a FETCH using the WITH
CONTINUE clause, and, that it received a truncation warning for a LOB or XML column prior to performing the
FETCH CURRENT CONTINUE operation. This verification can be done by checking the SQLWARN1 field in the
SQLCA following the FETCH and by examining the output length for LOB and XML columns.
SQLSTATE: 24524
-20412 SERIALIZATION OF AN XML VALUE RESULTED IN CHARACTERS THAT COULD NOT BE REPRESENTED IN THE TARGET ENCODING
Explanation: Serialization of XML data may require conversion to an encoding different from the source UTF-8
encoding. If characters exist in the source encoding that cannot be represented in the target encoding, code page
conversion produces substitution characters which are not allowed in the result of XML serialization.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Choose a target encoding that can represent all characters in the XML value. Unicode
encodings are recommended as they can represent all characters.
SQLSTATE: 2200W
-20422 A CREATE TABLE, OR DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE STATEMENT FOR table-name ATTEMPTED TO CREATE A TABLE WITH ALL THE COLUMNS DEFINED AS HIDDEN
Explanation: A CREATE TABLE or DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE statement attempted to create a table
in which all the columns are considered hidden. This can occur when A CREATE TABLE statement specifies
HIDDEN as a part of the definition of all of the columns. This process is not allowed. At least one column in a table
must not be defined as hidden.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Verify that the resulting table definition includes at least one column that is not defined as
hidden.

-20469 ROW OR COLUMN ACCESS CONTROL CANNOT BE ACTIVATED FOR TABLE table-name FOR REASON reason-code. object-type object-name IS NOT IN A VALID STATE FOR ACTIVATING ACCESS CONTROL FOR THIS TABLE
Explanation: Row access control cannot be activated explicitly or implicitly, or column access control cannot be
activated explicitly for the table.
table-name
The name of the table.
reason-code
A numeric value that indicates the reason for the failure.
36 The object-name view is defined on the table and the view is defined with the WITH CHECK
OPTION clause.
37 The object-name trigger is defined for the table and the trigger is not defined as secure.
38 A view is defined on the table, the object-name trigger is defined for that view, and the trigger is not
defined as secure.
39 The table is directly or indirectly referenced in the definition of a materialized query table.
40 The table is a created temporary table.
41 The table has a row permission or a column mask that is not valid because a previous attempt to
regenerate it was unsuccessful.
42 The table cannot be activated for the row access control because the table contains a security label
column.
43 The table cannot be activated for the row access control or column access control, because the table
is a system-period temporal table or history table.
object-type

-20470 object-type1 object-name1 MUST BE DEFINED AS SECURE BECAUSE object-type2 object-name2 IS DEPENDENT ON IT.
Explanation: An object that must be defined as secure is not defined as secure.
object-type1 and object-name1
The type and name of the object that must be defined as secure, but that is not.
object-type2 and object-name2
The type and name of the object that depends on the object that is identified by object-name1.
The object that is identified by object-name2 depends on object-name1 for row or column access control.
In most cases, object-type2 is a row permission or column mask. But if object-type2 is a sourced user-defined function,
object-name2 must be referenced in a row permission or column mask and object-name1 must be the underlying source
of the user-defined function.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Alter the object that is identified by object-name1 to make it secure.
SQLSTATE: 428H8
-20471 THE INSERT OR UPDATE IS NOT ALLOWED BECAUSE A RESULTING ROW DOES NOT SATISFY ROW PERMISSIONS.
Explanation: Row access control is enforced for the object of the insert or update operation. Consequently, all
attempts to insert or update rows in that table are checked to ensure that the resulting rows conform to the row
permissions defined for that table.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. No insert or update operations were performed, and the
contents of the table remain unchanged.
Programmer response: Examine the definitions of the row permissions to determine why the requested insert or
update operation was not successful. This error might be a data-dependent condition.

Explanation: The statement could not be processed because of a conflict with a column mask that is defined on a
column.
mask-name
The name of the column mask.
column-name
The name of the column.
reason-code
A numeric value that indicates the reason for the failure.
1 The result table of the select is derived from a set operation that involves one of the following set
operators:
v UNION ALL
v UNION DISTINCT
v EXCEPT ALL
v EXCEPT DISTINCT
v INTERSECT ALL
v INTERSECT DISTINCT
2 The column is referenced in the select list of the scalar fullselect and the result of the scalar
fullselect expression is derived from a set operation.
3 The column is also referenced in a grouping expression of the GROUP BY clause.
4 When a table contains a column that has a column mask defined on it, each column that is in the
table must be referenced as a simple column reference in the GROUP BY clause. Such columns
must not be referenced in a grouping expression in the GROUP BY clause.
5 The select list includes an aggregate function and the column that is identified by column-name is
specified as an input argument to the function. In this case, the column mask must not reference a
scalar fullselect or an aggregate function.
6 A column in the select list maps directly or indirectly to the column column-name of a table
expression, view, or common table expression. Such a column must be referenced only as an
argument to an aggregate function in the select list.
20 The result table is derived from a recursive common table expression and the column is specified in
the fullselect of the recursive common table expression.
21 A column in the select list is an INCLUDE column for a data change statement that is derived from
the column for which the mask is defined. The column mask cannot be applied in this context.
22 The result table is derived from a table function and the column was specified as an input
argument to the table function.
23 A column in the select list is derived from an OLAP specification and the column is referenced in
the partitioning expression or sort key expression of the OLAP specification.
24 The column is referenced in a WHEN clause of a CASE expression.
26 The column is referenced in an aggregate function with keyword DISTINCT.
30 An insert or update operation uses a masked value that is returned from the mask and column that
are identified in the message, and the expression that is specified in the THEN or ELSE clause of
the column mask definition is not a simple reference to the column.
When the object table is column access control activated, for an insert or update operation, the
return expression in the column mask definition must be a simple reference to the column for
which the mask is defined.
System action: The statement cannot be processed.
Programmer response: Take the action that corresponds to the reason-code value, and reissue the statement.
1 Either do not reference the column in the select list or do not use the set operation in this context.
2 Either do not reference the column in the select list of the scalar-fullselect expression or do not use a set
operator to derive the result of the scalar-fullselect expression in this context.
3 Either do not reference the column in the select list or do not reference the column in an expression in the
GROUP BY clause.
4 Either do not reference the column in the select list or change the GROUP BY clause to include only a
simple column reference for each column of the same table that is referenced in the mask-name mask.
5 Either do not reference the column in the select list or do not specify the column as an argument to the
aggregate function.
6 Either change the query to specify the column as an argument to an aggregate function or remove the
GROUP BY clause.
20 Either remove the reference to the column of the recursive common table expression from the select list or
do not use the recursive common table expression in this context.
21 Either remove the INCLUDE column from the select list or do not derive the INCLUDE column from the
column name.
22 Either do not reference the table function or do not specify the column as input to the table function.
23 Either do not reference the column in the OLAP expression or do not use the OLAP expression in this
context.
24 Either change the query to remove the reference to the column in the CASE expression or do not reference
the CASE expression in this context.
26 Either remove the reference to the column from the definition of the aggregate function or do not specify the
DISTINCT clause in this context.
30 Either change the statement to remove the reference to the column in the insert or update operation, or
contact the security administrator to ask them to deactivate the column access control from the object table
or modify the return expression in the column mask definition.

Possible causes for this error include:
v A clause was specified on an ALTER TABLE statement, but the attribute cannot be set or changed because the table
is not defined with hash organization.
v ADD ORGANIZE BY HASH was specified on an ALTER TABLE statement, but the table is already defined with
hash organization.
v ADD ORGANIZE BY HASH was specified on an ALTER TABLE statement, but the table is already defined with a
clustering index. Hash organization cannot be added to a table with a clustering index.
v ADD ORGANIZE BY HASH was specified on an ALTER TABLE statement, but either the table is defined with
APPEND YES, or it is a materialized query table.
v ADD ORGANIZE BY HASH was specified on an ALTER TABLE statement, but the table is defined in a table space
that is defined with MEMBER CLUSTER. Or, hash organization was specified on a CREATE TABLE statement that
specifies a table space which is defined with MEMBER CLUSTER.
v HASH SPACE was specified on a table that is not defined to be organized by hash. If the table is not defined with
hash organization, the HASH SPACE keyword is invalid in a partition element.
v HASH SPACE was specified on a table that resides in a table space which is not in reordered row format.

-30000 EXECUTION FAILED DUE TO A DISTRIBUTION PROTOCOL ERROR THAT WILL NOT AFFECT THE SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF SUBSEQUENT COMMANDS OR SQL STATEMENTS: REASON reason-code (sub-code)
Explanation: A DRDA protocol error has resulted which prevented successful execution of the current SQL
statement. The error was such that it will not preclude the successful execution of further SQL statements.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The SQLCA is formatted. Message DSNL031I or DSNL032I,
which might contain additional diagnostic information, might be issued to the MVS console.
Programmer response: Notify the DBA for assistance in analysis of the SQL statement which yielded this
SQLCODE.
Problem determination: The 'reason-code' identifies the DDM code point which represents the DDM reply message
received from the remote server in response to the attempt to execute the SQL statement. These represent internal
errors detected at the remote server or possibly, by the local DB2 functions.
The 'reason-code' value is the two-byte hexadecimal code point for the DDM reply message that represents the error
and is one of the following:
v X'1254' - CMDCHKRM
v X'220A' - DSCINVRM
v X'220E' - DTAMCHRM
v X'1245' - PRCCNVRM
v X'2202' - QRYNOPRM
v X'220F' - QRYPOPRM
v X'2207' - RDBACCRM
v X'2204' - RDBNACRM
v X'124C' - SYNTAXRM
A two-byte 'sub-code' accompanies 'reason-codes' X'220A' (DSCINVRM), X'1245' (PRCCNVRM), and X'124C'
(SYNTAXRM). In all other cases, the 'sub-code' is zero.
The 'sub-code' when nonzero, consists of two bytes such that the high-order byte indicates the site at which the error
was detected. This is X'01' if the error was detected by the local DB2; it is X'02' if the error was detected by the
remote server. The low-order byte is dependent on the 'reason-code' as follows:
v Description Error Code (DSCERRCD) if 'reason-code' = X'220A' (DSCINVRM).
v Syntax Error Code (SYNERRCD) if 'reason-code' = X'124C' SYNTAXRM).
v Conversational Protocol Error Code (PRCCVNCD) if 'reason-code' = X'1245' (PRCCNVRM).

SQLSTATE: 56072
-30020 EXECUTION FAILED DUE TO A DISTRIBUTION PROTOCOL ERROR THAT CAUSED DEALLOCATION OF THE CONVERSATION: REASON reason-code (sub-code)
Explanation: A DRDA protocol error has occurred that prevented the successful execution of the current SQL
statement or command, as well as any subsequent SQL statements.
The 'reason-code' identifies the DDM code point which represents the DDM reply message received from the remote
server in response to the attempt to execute the SQL statement. These represent internal errors detected at the remote
server site or possibly, by the local DB2 functions.
The 'reason-code' value is the two-byte hexadecimal code point for the DDM reply message that represents the error
and is one of the following:
v X'1232' - AGNPRMRM
v X'1254' - CMDCHKRM
v X'220A' - DSCINVRM
v X'220E' - DTAMCHRM
v X'0010' - FDODSC
v X'1218' - MGRDEPRM
v X'1245' - PRCCNVRM
v X'241A' - QRYDSC
v X'2202' - QRYNOPRM
v X'220F' - QRYPOPRM
v X'2207' - RDBACCRM
v X'2204' - RDBNACRM
v X'124C' - SYNTAXRM
A two byte sub-code accompanies 'reason codes'. The sub-code, when nonzero, consists of two bytes such that the
high-order byte indicates the site at which the error was detected. This is X'01' if the error was detected by the local
DB2; It is X'02' if the error was detected by the remote server. The low-order byte is dependent upon the 'reason
code' as follows:
v Description Error Code (DSCERRCD) if reason code= X'220A ' (DSCINVRM).
v Syntax Error Code (SYNERRCD) if reason code = X'124C ' (SYNTAXRM).
v Conversational Protocol Error Code (PRCCVNCD) if reason code = X'1245' (PRCCNVRM).
v Manager Dependency Error Code (DEPERRCD) if reason code = X' 1218' (MGRDEPRM).
Refer to Open Group Technical Standard, DRDA Version 3 Vol. 3: Distributed Data Management Architecture for a
detailed discussion of the semantics of the DDM terms DSCERRCD, SYNERRCD, PRCCNVCD, and DEPERRCD.
System action: The statement cannot be processed. The SQLCA is formatted and the conversation on which the
error was detected is deallocated. Message DSNL031I or DSNL032I, which might contain additional diagnostic
information, might be issued to the MVS console.
Programmer response: The connection to the server has been broken, and the server has, therefore, rolled back the
unit of work. In this case, the only SQL statement that may be successfully executed is ROLLBACK. However, if the
requester detects this error on a COMMIT, then it is unknown whether the unit of work was committed or rolled
back at the server.

-30021 EXECUTION FAILED DUE TO A DISTRIBUTION PROTOCOL ERROR THAT WILL AFFECT THE SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF SUBSEQUENT COMMANDS OR SQL STATEMENTS: MANAGER manager AT LEVEL level NOT SUPPORTED ERROR
Explanation: A DRDA error occurred that prevented the successful execution of the current SQL statement or
command and any subsequent SQL statements.
A manager-level conflict was detected during the processing of the DDM EXCSAT command. Refer to the Open Group
Technical Standard, DRDA Version 3 Vol. 3: Distributed Data Management Architecture for a detailed description of
EXCSAT processing and errors.
The manager value is the 2-byte hexadecimal code point of the DDM manager class identified as not supported in the
EXCSATRD that reported the error. Refer to the DDM term MGRLVL in the Open Group Technical Standard, DRDA
Version 3 Vol. 3: Distributed Data Management Architecture for the 2-byte hexadecimal values.
The level value is the 2-byte hexadecimal value of the manager level identified as not supported in the EXCSATRD
that reported the error. Refer to the DDM term MGRLVL in the Open Group Technical Standard, DRDA Version 3 Vol. 3:
Distributed Data Management Architecture for the 2-byte hexadecimal values.

-30050 command-or-SQL-statement-type COMMAND OR SQL STATEMENT INVALID WHILE BIND PROCESS IN PROGRESS
Explanation: A remote command or remote SQL execution was attempted while a remote bind was in progress. The
only commands allowed during bind are, BIND STATEMENT, END BIND, ROLLBACK, or COMMIT.
System action: The request is rejected. The local DB2 is disconnected from remote server.
Programmer response: Ensure the remote bind has completed before attempting to execute an SQL statement or
process a remote command. COMMIT and ROLLBACK will terminate the bind processing.
SQLSTATE: 58011
-30051 BIND PROCESS WITH SPECIFIED PACKAGE NAME AND CONSISTENCY TOKEN NOT ACTIVE
Explanation: Binding of a statement or end bind was attempted while the package was not undergoing bind
processing.
System action: The bind statement request or end bind request is rejected. The local DB2 is disconnected from the
remote server.
Programmer response: Ensure that the server processing the bind request was not abending when this request was
being processed, or that the package name hasn't changed before terminating the remote bind package request.
SQLSTATE: 58012
-30052 PROGRAM PREPARATION ASSUMPTIONS ARE INCORRECT
Explanation: The program preparation assumptions in effect for binding a statement (i.e. BINDSQLSTT command)
are incorrect.
System action: The statement is rejected.
Programmer response: The creation of the package following this error is dependent on the package creation
options specified at begin bind time.
SQLSTATE: 42932
-30053 OWNER AUTHORIZATION FAILURE
Explanation: An authorization error associated with the package owner is detected. The AS, for example, has
determined that the binder has specified a package owner that the binder has no authorization to specify.
System action: The begin bind request is rejected.
Programmer response: Correct the authorization problem and reissue the request.
SQLSTATE: 42506
-30060 RDB AUTHORIZATION FAILURE
Explanation: The user is not authorized to access an RDB.
System action: The request is rejected.
Programmer response: Correct the authorization problem and resubmit the job.
SQLSTATE: 08004
-30061 RDB NOT FOUND
Explanation: An attempt was made to access an RDB which cannot be found. This usually means that a requester
specified the server location name incorrectly. The server responded by indicating that the requester's specification of
the server location name is incorrect. Requester or server changes are needed to make the location names consistent.
Location names for DB2 systems are defined in the BSDS DDF record and are also in the DSNL004I console message
when DDF is started.
System action: The request is not processed.
Programmer response: Ensure the RDB name was correctly specified and resubmit the job.

Programmer response: Ensure the object has been correctly specified and resubmit the job or reissue the command.
SQLSTATE: 58015
-30072 parameter subcode PARAMETER NOT SUPPORTED ERROR
Explanation: A particular parameter is not supported by either the application requester or the remote server.
Values for parameter
v Two byte hexadecimal DDM code point.
Values for subcode
v Two byte hexadecimal number defined as follows: This subcode is composed of two distinct parts, but may
optionally be zero. The high-order byte (when not zero) indicates the site at which the error was detected. This is
X'01' if the error was detected by the local DB2; it is X'02' if the error was detected by the remote server. The low
order byte is always zero.
Common parameters that are not supported include:
X'2450' Usually this means that the server does not support the attribute clause on prepare.
System action: The command/SQL statement is rejected. A disconnect has occurred.
Programmer response: The connection to the server has been broken, and the server has therefore rolled back the
unit of work. In this case, the only SQL statement that may be successfully executed is ROLLBACK. However, if the
requester detects this error on a COMMIT, then it is unknown whether the unit of work was committed or rolled
back at the server.
SQLSTATE: 58016
-30073 parameter subcode PARAMETER VALUE NOT SUPPORTED ERROR
Explanation: The specified parameter value is not supported by either the local DB2 or the remote server.
The parameter, is a 2-byte hexadecimal DDM code point. See Open Group Technical Standard, DRDA Version 3 Vol. 3:
Distributed Data Management Architecture for a definition of the valid code points. Common values for parameter
include:
X'0035' Usually means that a DB2 server does not support the single-byte coded character set identifier (CCSID)
sent by the requester, or a DB2 requester does not support the single-byte CCSID received from a server. See
X'119C' for more information.
X'1144' DRDA servers return this code point when a DB2 client specifies a version for a package and the DRDA
server does not support versions.
X'119C' If the subcode information contains X'01', the requester does not support the single-byte CCSID that the
server wants to use. If the subcode information contains X'02', the server does not support the single-byte
CCSID that the requester wants to use.
Determine the single-byte CCSIDs for the requester and server systems. The single-byte CCSID for DB2
subsystems is defined in the DSNHDECP module or in a user-supplied application defaults module. One or
both partners might be using an incorrect CCSID, or support might need to be added.
X'147A' DB2 servers can return this code point when a numeric input host variable is not within the range that DB2
supports. See the explanation of SQLCODE -406 for more information.
X'14AC'
DB2 servers return this code point when a DRDA client requests an authentication mechanism that is not
supported by the DB2 server. See the explanation of DB2 reason code 00D3010E for more information.
X'2110'. Usually means that a requester specified the server location name incorrectly. The server responded by
indicating that the requester's specification of the server location name is incorrect, and the length of the
location name is longer than that supported by the server. Requester or server changes are needed so the
location names are consistent. Location names for DB2 systems are defined in the BSDS DDF record and can
also be seen in the DSNL004I console message when DDF is started.
X'2120' Usually means that the server does not support the use of double quote string delimiters in SQL statements.
DB2 COBOL applications can use double quote string delimiters in SQL statements. This requires that the
program be precompiled with the SQLDELIM(QUOTESQL) option. If the server product does not support
double quote SQL statement string delimiters, then the program must be modified to use single quote SQL
string delimiters and be precompiled with the SQLDELIM(APOSTSQL) option.
X'2121' Usually means that the there is a semantic error with the string that specifies the character used as a decimal
delimiter in SQL statements.
X'213F' Means that the server was processing a bind or rebind command that specified an unsupported value for
the DYNAMICRULES bind parameter. If the server is a DB2 Version 3 system, specify
DYNAMICRULES(RUN) or omit the DYNAMICRULES parameter.
The 'subcode', which is a 2-byte hexadecimal number, consists of two distinct parts and can optionally be zero. The
high-order byte (when not zero) indicates the site at which the error was detected. If the error was detected by the
local DB2, it is X'01'. If the error was detected by the remote server, it is X'02'. The low-order byte is always zero.
System action: The command or SQL statement is rejected. A disconnect occurred.
Programmer response: The connection to the server was broken, and the server rolled back the unit of work. The
only SQL statement that can be successfully executed is ROLLBACK. However, if the requester detects this error on a
COMMIT, then it is unknown whether the unit of work was committed or rolled back at the server.

00C12850
Explanation: DB2 stored procedure DSNACICS issues this abend code when the JCL startup procedure for the
stored procedure address space in which DSNACICS runs contains a DSNDUMP DD statement. DSNACICS takes an
SVC dump when it generates an error message. At the time of the dump:
v Register 2 contains the address of the message that was being generated.
v Register 3 contains the address of the first parameter that was passed to DSNACICS.
v Register 4 contains the address of the XPL parameter area that was passed to DSNACICX.
System action: The stored procedure requests an SVC dump and terminates.
System programmer response: If the dump was requested to diagnose a problem in user exit DSNACICX, use IPCS
to examine the contents of the dump. If the dump was requested because of a possible error in the DB2 stored
procedure, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see
Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.

00C20021
Explanation: A member of a DB2 data sharing group was unable to perform a global drain because a physical close
failure occurred in a peer DB2 due to an exceptional state or CASTOUT process failure. DSNT501I is sent to the
console to report the condition.
System action: A 'resource not available' return code, reason code, and object name are sent back to the requesting
function.
00C20031
Explanation: An attempt to acquire a page latch in either shared mode or exclusive mode was rejected due to a
timeout on the agent's wait time.
System action: A 'resource not available' return code, reason code, and object name are sent back to the requesting
function.
System programmer response: A diagnostic dump with reason code 00C2010F should follow 00C20031.
00C20069.
Explanation: DB2 is unable to perform the drain function on an object (a table space, an index space, or a partition)
because a DB2 member in the data sharing group was in the process of restarting.
System action: If the problem was encountered by DB2 when trying to automatically recover a group buffer pool
recovery pending (GRECP) object following the failure of a group buffer pool (GBP), then DB2 issues message
DSNB350I or DSNB351I to the console with this reason code indicating that the object cannot be automatically
recovered.
Otherwise, a 'resource not available' return code, reason code and object name are sent back to the requesting
function. DSNT501I is sent to the console to report the condition.
System programmer response: If DSNB350I or DSNB351I messages were issued, wait for the failed DB2 member to
complete its restart processing and then recover the GRECP objects as indicated in the "System Programmer
Response" for DSNB350I or DSNB351I.
00C2006A
Explanation: DB2 was unable to perform the drain function on an object (table space, index space, or partition)
because the object was held by one or more indoubt threads.
System action: If the problem was encountered by DB2 when trying to automatically recover a group buffer pool
recovery pending (GRECP) object following the failure of a group buffer pool (GBP), then DB2 issues message
DSNB350I or DSNB351I to the console with this reason code indicating that the object cannot be automatically
recovered.
System programmer response: Use the DB2 DISPLAY DB CLAIMERS command to find the indoubt threads. If the
threads have been left indoubt because DB2 or a transaction manager was unable to automatically resolve the
indoubts, you can use the DB2 RECOVER INDOUBT command to resolve the indoubt thread and remove the
indoubt claimer on the object (the DB2 RECOVER INDOUBT command should only be used when automatic
resolution does not work).
If DSNB350I or DSNB351I messages were issued, then after you resolve the indoubt threads, recover the GRECP
objects as indicated in the "System Programmer Response" for DSNB350I or DSNB351I.

00C200C1
Explanation: The page version number in the database page header is outside the valid range of values. This can be
caused by one of the following errors:
v Copying data sets improperly from another DB2 subsystem.
v In a CREATE TABLESPACE statement, specifying a VCAT catalog name that is the same as the name of an object
in another DB2 subsystem on the same processor.
v Conditionally starting DB2 to a prior time with an invalid RBA range.
v Incorrect use of the REPAIR utility (modifying the page RBA).
v The page was damaged by a DB2 system error.
v TOD clock values are out of synch between systems in a Parallel Sysplex?.
System action: The requesting execution unit is abended. If DSNB1SWS issues the ABEND, then it is preceded by a
DSNT500I message indicating which page is in error and a DSNI004I message indicating the page set is put in
STOPE mode.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer, print the SYS1.LOGREC, and request the SVC dump.
User response: One of the following actions:
v If the data set was copied from another DB2 subsystem, run DSN1COPY with the RESET option to set the log
RBAs in each page to 0.
v If a table space was created with the wrong VCAT catalog name, drop the object and create it again.
v If DB2 was conditionally started with an invalid RBA range, correct the RBA range and restart DB2 with conditions
again.
v If the page was damaged by the REPAIR utility, restore it with the RECOVER utility using the PAGE option.
v If you are running data sharing, check the connectivity of the systems to the sysplex timers. The TOD clock values
of all systems in the sysplex should all be within one microsecond. TOD clock values will not drift more than one
microsecond apart unless a sysplex timer is malfunctioning.
v Otherwise, inform your system programmer that you suspect an error.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.

00C200E0
Explanation: A table space or index space cannot be accessed because DB2 is unable to create the referenced buffer
pool. The referenced buffer pool size was zero, which indicates to DB2 that this buffer pool should not be activated.
DB2 message DSNB602I was issued to inform the operator of the error. This reason code and the table space or index
space name are recorded in the cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in the SQLCA.
System action: An SQLCODE -904 (resource not available) is returned to the user. The SVC dump and the
SYS1.LOGREC recording are not requested.
System programmer response: Analyze the virtual storage content of the ssnmDBM1 address space to determine
further action. If appropriate, use the ALTER TABLESPACE or ALTER INDEX statement to modify the affected table
space or index to indicate a usable buffer pool. To determine a usable buffer pool, use the DISPLAY BUFFERPOOL
command. If necessary, use the ALTER BUFFERPOOL command to activate the failing buffer pool by setting its
VPSIZE to a nonzero value.
00C200E1
Explanation: The buffer manager (BM) subcomponent of DB2 is unable to open a data set that is required to be
accessed by the requesting function. An error was returned by the media manager CONNECT function, which was
invoked to open a VSAM data set. DB2 message DSNB204I was issued to inform the operator of the error condition.
This reason code and the data set name are recorded in the cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in the
SQLCA or in messages.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user. Abend status is recorded in SYS1.LOGREC.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Refer to system message IEC161I and DB2 message DSNB204I for assistance in
determining the cause of the error. Correct the situation, and notify the user to invoke the application again.
Problem determination: The unexpected media manager return code is saved in register 8. It may help determine
the cause of the failure.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v IDCAMS LISTCAT output for the ICF (VSAM) catalog that contains the DB2 subsystem catalog that defined the
failing index or table.
v VTOC listing of the disk volume on which the failing operation occurred.
00C200E2
Explanation: The buffer manager (BM) subcomponent of DB2 is unable to open a data set that is required by the
requesting function. An error was returned by the dynamic allocation function that was invoked to allocate a VSAM
data set. DB2 message DSNB207I was issued to inform the operator of the error condition. This reason code and the
data set name are recorded in the cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in the SQLCA or in messages.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user. Abend status is recorded in SYS1.LOGREC.
System programmer response: The error code returned from the dynamic allocation function was externalized in
the DSNB207I message. Refer to the appropriate MVS publication for an explanation of this error code. Correct the
situation, and notify the user to invoke the application again.
User response: Notify the system programmer. Invoke the application again after the system programmer has
corrected the error.
Problem determination: The unexpected dynamic allocation return code is saved in register 8. It may help
determine the cause of the failure.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v IDCAMS LISTCAT output for the ICF (VSAM) catalog that contains the DB2 subsystem catalog that defined the
failing index or table.
v VTOC listing of the disk volume on which the failing operation occurred.
00C200E5
Explanation: The buffer manager (BM) subcomponent of DB2 is unable to perform the I/O operation on a data set
that is required by the requesting function. A logical I/O error was detected by the buffer manager I/O functions.
The logical I/O error indicates that a requested page (read operation) resides within the error page range of the data
set. This reason code and the data set name are recorded in the cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in
the SQLCA or in messages.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user.
Operator response: Use the -DISPLAY DB command to obtain the error page range. Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: The error page range can be located from the console sheet or through the -DISPLAY
DB command. Correct the error pages with the recovery utility, and notify the user to invoke the application again. If
you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting
the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: Notify the system programmer. Invoke the application after the system programmer has corrected
the error.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v IDCAMS LISTCAT output for the ICF (VSAM) catalog that contains the DB2 subsystem catalog that defined the
failing index or table.
v VTOC listing of the disk volume on which the failing operation occurred.
00C200E6
Explanation: The buffer manager (BM) subcomponent of DB2 is unable to perform the I/O operation on a data set
that is required by the requesting function. A permanent I/O error was detected by the media manager during
preformat processing. This reason code and the data set name are recorded in the cursor table (CT) and made
available to the user in the SQLCA or in messages.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user.
System programmer response: Recover the entire data set with the recovery utility, and notify the user to invoke
the application again. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about
identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: Notify the system programmer. Invoke the application after the system programmer has corrected
the error.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v IDCAMS LISTCAT output for the ICF (VSAM) catalog that contains the DB2 subsystem catalog that defined the
failing index or table.
v VTOC listing of the disk volume on which the failing operation occurred.
Check the MVS console log for an IOS (I/O subsystem) error message indicating the type of I/O error that occurred.
If an IOS message was issued, follow the problem determination directions for that message.
00C200E8
Explanation: The buffer pool (indicated in the SQLCA) cannot be created because of insufficient virtual storage.
Message DSNB603I or DSNB605I was issued to inform the operator of the error. This reason code and the buffer pool
ID are recorded in the cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in the SQLCA or in messages.
System action: An SQLCODE -904 (resource not available) is returned to the user. The SVC dump and the
SYS1.LOGREC recording are not requested.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Analyze the virtual storage content of the ssnmDBM1 address space to determine
further action. If appropriate, use the ALTER TABLESPACE or ALTER INDEX statement to indicate use of a different
buffer pool. Otherwise, use ALTER BUFFERPOOL commands to balance virtual storage usage for all buffer pools.
00C200E9
Explanation: A buffer could not be assigned in the buffer pool (indicated in the SQLCA) because all buffers in the
buffer pool are in a nondisplaceable state. (Buffers are in a nondisplaceable state when they contain actively
referenced pages or updated pages for which writes are pending.)
Message DSNB601I was issued to inform the operator of the error. This reason code and the buffer pool ID are
recorded in the cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in the SQLCA or in messages.
System action: An SQLCODE -904 (resource not available) is returned to the user. The SVC dump and the
SYS1.LOGREC recording are not requested.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Reduce concurrent activity by reducing the number of DB2 threads, or, if necessary,
increase the size of the failing buffer pool by using the ALTER BUFFERPOOL command.
00C200EA
Explanation: DB2 is unable to perform the drain function on an object (a table space, an index space, or a partition)
because the object was held by other claimers and the drain request timed out waiting for the claim count to reach
zero.
System action: If the problem was encountered by DB2 when trying to automatically recover a group buffer pool
recovery pending (GRECP) object following the failure of a group buffer pool (GBP), then DB2 issues message
DSNB350I or DSNB351I to the console with this reason code indicating that the object cannot be automatically
recovered.
Otherwise, a 'resource not available' return and reason code are sent back to the requesting function. DB2 message
DSNT500I may be sent to the console. The reason code and the object name are recorded in the cursor table (CT) and
made available to the user in the SQLCA or in the message.
System programmer response: Take one of these actions:
v Reevaluate the utility timeout factor on installation panel DSNTIPI and increase it, if necessary.
v Find the threads holding the object through the -DISPLAY DB CLAIMERS command on the object. Either terminate
those threads or wait until no one holds the object. Then invoke the application again.
If DSNB350I or DSNB351I messages were issued, then after you take one of the actions above, recover the GRECP
objects as indicated in the "System Programmer Response" for DSNB350I or DSNB351I.
00C200EB
Explanation: A data sharing group member is not able to perform a global drain request on an object (a table space,
an index space, or a partition). One or more peer members in the group hold retained locks on the object. Message
DSNT501I is sent to the console to report the condition.
System action: A 'resource not available' return code, reason code, and object name are sent back to the requesting
function.
System programmer response: Use the DISPLAY DATABASE command with the LOCKS option to display the
member names owning the retained locks. You must restart those subsystems to remove the 'resource unavailable'
condition.
Problem determination:
00C200EC
Explanation: A member of a DB2 data sharing group was unable to perform a global drain request on an object (a
table space, an index space, or a partition). One or more peer DB2s in the group failed to drain the object because
some error occurred. Both the DB2 running the request and the peer DB2 send DB2 message DSNT500I to the console
to report the problem.
System action: A 'resource not available' return code, reason code and object name are sent back to the requesting
function.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Retrieve the DSNT501I messages from the console and analyze the corresponding
reason and error codes.
Problem determination:
00C200ED
Explanation: DB2, in a data sharing environment, detected that the requested use of a type 1 index with a
SUBPAGES value greater than 1 would have caused the index to become group buffer pool dependent. DB2 does not
allow type 1 indexes with a SUBPAGES value greater than 1 to become group buffer pool dependent.
System action: The use of the index is not allowed.
User response: If the index is to be used in group buffer pool dependent mode, then either the index should be
converted to a type 2 index or it should be converted to a type 1 index with SUBPAGES 1.
00C200EF
Explanation: DB2 was unable to open a required data set because the data set does not have the extended
addressability attribute.
System action: A ¡°resource not available¡± code is returned. This reason code and the data set name are recorded in
the SQLCA and in message DSNT500I.
System programmer response: Associate the data set with an extended addressability data class.

00C200F0
Explanation: DB2 encountered an error on an IXLCACHE request while trying to write a page to the group buffer
pool during physical lock (P-lock) negotiation.
System action: The requesting execution unit abends. The error is recorded to SYS1.LOGREC, but the dump is
suppressed and the abend is retried in the functional recovery. Another group member, requesting the P-lock that
caused the negotiation on this member, receives a resource not available code of 00C20252, and its P-lock request is
denied.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
00C200F1
Explanation: The buffer manager (BM) subcomponent of DB2 is unable to unallocate a DB2 data set. An error was
returned by the dynamic unallocation function that was invoked to unallocate a data set. This reason code and the
data set name are recorded in the cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in the SQLCA or in messages.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user. The SVC dump and the SYS1.LOGREC
recording are requested.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.

00C200F2
Explanation: The buffer manager (BM) subcomponent of DB2 is unable to close a DB2 data set. An error was
returned by the media manager DISCONNECT function that was invoked to close a data set. This reason code and
the data set name are recorded in the cursor table (CT) and in the SQLCA or in messages.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user. The SVC dump and the SYS1.LOGREC
recording are requested.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: The unexpected media manager disconnect reason code is saved in register 8 and may help
determine the cause of the failure. Locate the corresponding IEC161I message in the operator console sheet, and refer
to the appropriate MVS publication for assistance in determining the cause of the error.

00C200F3
Explanation: DB2 is unable to obtain one of the following locks:
v SYSLGRNG or SYSLGRNXrecording lock on a table space
v Group buffer pool dependent conversion lock on a page set or partition
v Group buffer pool start or stop lock
v ALTER BUFFERPOOL lock
The IRLM LOCK request detected a timeout error.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user. This reason code and the data set name are
recorded in the cursor table (CT) and are available to the user in the SQLCA or in messages.
User response: Resubmit the failing application.
Problem determination:
00C200F4
Explanation: DB2 is unable to obtain one of the following locks:
v SYSLGRNG or SYSLGRNXrecording lock on a table space
v Group buffer pool dependent conversion lock on a page set or partition
v Group buffer pool start or stop lock
v ALTER BUFFERPOOL lock
The IRLM LOCK request detected an out-of-storage condition.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user. This reason code is recorded in the cursor
table (CT) and is available to the user in the SQLCA or in messages.
User response: Resubmit the failing application.
Problem determination:
00C200F6
Explanation: The buffer manager (BM) subcomponent of DB2 is unable to open a data set that is required to be
accessed by the requesting function. The data set has been migrated by DFHSM and the data set must be recalled
before being accessed. Since the RECALL(yes) option was selected by the installation, a recall for the migrated data
set has been initiated. A recall was not complete after the amount of time specified in the RECALL option had
elapsed.
This reason code and the data set name are recorded in the cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in the
SQLCA or in messages. The data set name and the reason code indicated are the last migrated data set requested.
Other migrated data sets within the table space may exist. For each one that exists, a DSNT500I message containing
the data set name and reason code has been sent to the console.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user. A DSNT500I message is sent to the console.
User response: After the data set has been restored, rerun the application program, transaction, or query. If
necessary, contact the operator to find out the status of the migrated data set.
00C200F7
Explanation: The page found in the buffer is not the page requested by the buffer manager. The buffer manager
detected the error by comparing the page number of the page returned with the requested page number. This error
may be caused by one of the problems:
v Either the VTOC or VVDS is damaged, causing multiple data sets to occupy the same extents on DASD.
v The page was altered incorrectly by a non-DB2 facility or a DB2 service aid.
v An internal DB2 error damaged the page. The recovery log will be required for problem determination.
System action: The requesting execution unit is abended.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer, print the SYS1.LOGREC, and request the SVC dump.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: The following general purpose registers (GPRs) contain the indicated diagnostic
information:
GPR Content
7 Address of the page buffer
8 Address of the page set block (PB)
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v IDCAMS LISTCAT output for the ICF (VSAM) catalog that contains the DB2 subsystem catalog that defined the
failing index or table.
v VTOC listing of the disk volume on which the failing operation occurred.
v VVDS dump of the volumes that contain the data set.
v DB2 REPAIR dump of the requested page.
v DSN1LOGP detail report that contains log records associated with the damaged page.
00C200F8
Explanation: The buffer manager (BM) subcomponent of DB2 is unable to perform the I/O operation on a data set.
A physical I/O error was detected by the buffer manager I/O functions.
This reason code and the data set name are recorded in the cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in the
SQLCA or in messages.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user. A DSNB224I message is issued, unless it has
already been issued 10 times for the data set.
If the I/O is a write operation, or if the I/O is a read operation performed during restart or rollback, then the error
page range of the data set is updated. A DSNU086E message is issued indicating the data set name and its
corresponding I/O error page range, unless it has already been issued 10 times for the data set.
Operator response: Use the -DISPLAY DB command to obtain the error page range. Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: The error page range can be located from the console sheet or with the -DISPLAY
DB command. Correct the error pages with the recovery utility, and notify the user to invoke the application again. If
you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting
the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: Notify the system programmer. Invoke the application after the system programmer has corrected
the error.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of

If an IOS message was issued, follow the problem determination directions for that message.
00C200F9
Explanation: DB2 is unable to open a data set that the requesting function must access. The data set was migrated
by HSM and must be recalled before being accessed. DB2's attempt to initiate a recall of the migrated data set was
unsuccessful.
This reason code and the data set name are recorded in the cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in the
SQLCA or in messages. The data set name and the reason code indicated are the last requested migrated data set.
Other migrated data sets might exist. For each existing data set, message DSNT500I containing the data set name and
reason code was sent to the console.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user. A DSNT500I message is sent to the console.
User response: Issue the HSM command (HRECALL) to restore the migrated data set. Rerun your application
program, transaction, or query after the data set is restored.
Problem determination:
00C200FA
Explanation: The buffer manager (BM) subcomponent of DB2 is unable to obtain an open lock to perform a physical
open or close of a page set. A timeout error was detected by the IRLM LOCK request. The reason code and the
database and page set names are recorded in the cursor table (CT). They are made available to the user in the
SQLCA or in messages.
A common reason for this failure is when IRLMRWT is less than RECALLD, and an HSM recall for the migrated
data set exceeds IRLMRWT.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user.
User response: Resubmit the failing application.
00C200FB
Explanation: The buffer manager (BM) subcomponent of DB2 is unable to obtain an open lock to perform a physical
open or close of a page set. An out-of-storage condition was detected by the IRLM LOCK request. The reason code
and the database and page set names are recorded in the cursor table (CT). They are available to the user in the
SQLCA or in messages.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user.
User response: Resubmit the failing application.
00C200FC
Explanation: The buffer manager (BM) subcomponent of DB2 is unable to obtain an open lock to perform a physical

System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user.
User response: Resubmit the failing application.
00C200FD
Explanation: The buffer manager is unable to perform the I/O operation on a data set due to an error on page's
parity flag detected by the buffer manager's I/O function.
System action: A 'resource not available' return code is returned to the user. The related reason code 00C200FD, the
page number, the page set name, and the data base name in question are recorded in the cursor table (CT) and made
available to the user in the SQLCA.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: The error page can be found via SQLCA. Correct the error pages with the recovery
utility, and notify the user to invoke the application again.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of

00C200FE
Explanation: DB2 is unable to open a data set that the requesting function must access. The data set was migrated
by DFHSM and must be recalled before being accessed. Since the RECALL(no) option was selected by the
installation, recall for the migrated data set was not initiated.
This reason code and the data set name are recorded in the cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in the
SQLCA or in messages. The data set name and the reason code indicated are the last migrated data set requested.
Other migrated data sets within the table space might exist. For each existing data set, message DSNT500I containing
the data set name and reason code has been sent to the console.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user. A DSNT500I message is sent to the console.
System programmer response: Issue the DFHSM command (HRECALL) to restore the migrated data set.
User response: Notify the system programmer. After the data set is restored, rerun the application program,
transaction, or query.
00C200FF
Explanation: An attempted open of a page set failed because DB2 has reached the MVS limit on concurrent open
data sets.
System action: A 'resource not available' (SQLCODE -904) is returned to the user and the requested open is not
performed. This reason code and the data set name are recorded in the cursor table (CT) and made available to the
user in the SQLCA. A DSNB207I message is displayed on the operator console. The SVC dump and the
SYS1.LOGREC recording are not requested.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Reduce the number of page sets that must be kept open by DB2 by limiting the
amount of concurrent activity.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic item:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00C20101
Explanation: The sharing attribute is inconsistent between the header page of a data set and the DBD. This reason
code and the data set name are made available to the user in the SQLCA or in messages.
System action: A ¡°resource not available¡± code is returned to the user.
System programmer response: First determine whether the database is shared, and whether it is owned by this
system. This can be achieved by issuing a SELECT on the SYSIBM.SYSDATABASE catalog table, where the database
name is the database you are checking, and by examining the ROSHARE column.
If the DB2 catalog indicates that it is a ROSHARE OWNER database, the problem can be corrected by the REPAIR
utility or the -STOP DATABASE command. The -STOP DATABASE command will reformat the header page and
make it consistent with the DBD.
If the database is ROSHARE READ on this system, then check the definition of the database on the owning system.
If, on the owning system, the database is no longer defined as ROSHARE OWNER, then the table space or index
should be dropped on the system on which the error was detected, since the database has been altered to nonshared
by the owning system. However, if the database is defined as ROSHARE OWNER on the owning system, then issue
a -STOP DATABASE with the SPACENAM parameter from the owning system, which will make the header page
consistent with the owner's DBD, and force this change to DASD, making it available to other systems.
If it is a nonshared database, then the sharing attribute can only be corrected via the REPAIR utility.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00C20102
Explanation: A read-only system attempted to access an inconsistent data set. This reason code and the data set
name are made available to the user in the SQLCA or in messages.
System action: A ¡°resource not available¡± code is returned to the user.
System programmer response: On the system in which the database is defined as ROSHARE OWNER, perform the
following tasks:
v Use the -DISPLAY DATABASE command to ensure there is no exceptional state for this table space or index.
v Issue the -STOP DATABASE command with the SPACENAM parameter to stop this table space or index.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00C20103
Explanation: DB2 is unable to access a data set because its system page is inaccessible. This reason code and the
data set name are available to the user in the SQLCA or in messages.
System action: A "resource not available" code is returned to the user.
System programmer response: Determine why the system page is inaccessible by examining any error messages
that appeared on the console at the time of the error, or by issuing a -DISPLAY DATABASE command. Take the
appropriate action to correct the situation.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00C20104
Explanation: DB2 is unable to access a shared data set because it was down leveled by a DSN1COPY job, or a
REPAIR utility with REPLACE RESET specified. This reason code and the data set name are made available to the
user in the SQLCA or in messages.
System action: A ¡°resource not available¡± code is returned to the user.
System programmer response: On the system in which the database is defined as ROSHARE OWNER, perform the
following tasks:
v Use the -DISPLAY DATABASE command to ensure there is no exceptional state for this table space or index.
v Issue the -STOP DATABASE command with the SPACENAM parameter to stop this table space or index.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00C20105
Explanation: The page set creation timestamp is inconsistent between the header page and the DBD. This reason
code and the data set name are made available to the user in the SQLCA or in messages.
System action: A ¡°resource not available¡± code is returned to the user.
System programmer response: First determine whether the database is shared, and whether it is owned by this
system. This can be achieved by issuing a SELECT on the SYSIBM.SYSDATABASE catalog table, where the database
name is the database you are checking, and examining the ROSHARE column.
For a data set in a ROSHARE OWNER database, if the failure occurs on a CREATE TABLESPACE or CREATE
INDEX, the timestamp mismatch indicates that the table space or index was previously dropped, but DB2 was unable
to delete the data set. In this case, the data set must be deleted using AMS DELETE CLUSTER before the CREATE
can take place.
For a data set in a ROSHARE OWNER database at any time other than CREATE TABLESPACE or CREATE INDEX,
the inconsistent timestamp can be corrected by first stopping the table space or index via the -STOP DATABASE
command with the SPACENAM parameter, and then issuing the -START DATABASE command to start it. The -STOP
DATABASE command will reformat the header page using the information retrieved from the DBD.
For a data set in a ROSHARE READ database, a timestamp mismatch indicates that the table space or index has been
dropped and re-created on the owning system, and must also be dropped and re-created on this system.
For a data set in a nonshared database, the timestamp value in the header page can only be corrected via the REPAIR
utility.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00C20106
Explanation: An update was attempted on a database defined as ROSHARE READ. This reason code and the data
set name are made available to the user in the SQLCA or in messages.
System action: A ¡°resource not available¡± code is returned to the user.
User response: An update operation is not allowed in this database. Check to ensure that the target of the update
was correct and that the database is defined as ROSHARE READ. If the update should occur, issue the update on the
system in which the database was defined as ROSHARE OWNER.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
,
00C20107
Explanation: An update was attempted in a ROSHARE OWNER database, but the data set was opened in RO
mode. This reason code and the data set name are made available to the user in the SQLCA or in messages.
System action: A ¡°resource not available¡± code is returned to the user.
System programmer response: Issue the -STOP DATABASE command with the SPACENAM parameter to explicitly
stop this table space/index space and then issue the -START DATABASE ACCESS(RW) command.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00C20108
Explanation: An object in a ROSHARE OWNER database cannot be accessed. At least one system with the database
defined as ROSHARE READ is still accessing it. This reason code and the data set name are made available to the
user in the SQLCA or in messages.
System action: A ¡°resource not available¡± code is returned to the user.
System programmer response: Ensure that there are no systems on which the database is defined as ROSHARE
READ that are still accessing the database. Issue the -STOP DATABASE command with the SPACENAM parameter
on the ROSHARE READ systems that are accessing the database.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00C20109
Explanation: An object in a ROSHARE READ database cannot be accessed. The system with the database defined as
ROSHARE OWNER still has RW access. This reason code and the data set name are made available to the user in the
SQLCA or in messages.
System action: A ¡°resource not available¡± code is returned to the user.
System programmer response: On the system in which the database is defined as ROSHARE OWNER, perform the
following tasks:
v Use the -DISPLAY DATABASE command to ensure there are no exceptional states for this table space or index.
v Issue the -STOP DATABASE command with the SPACENAM parameter to stop this table space or index.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00C2010A
Explanation: DB2 is attempting to open a shared data set in a ROSHARE READ database, but the system cannot
locate the data set. The table space or index might already be dropped from the owning system.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user. This reason code and the data set name are
made available to the user in the SQLCA or in messages.
System programmer response: Run IDCAMS LISTCAT to verify the existence of this data set. Verify whether the
associated table space or index exists in the database defined as ROSHARE OWNER. If not, issue DROP
TABLESPACE or INDEX on all systems in which the database is defined as ROSHARE READ.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00C2010B
Explanation: DB2 is attempting to open a shared data set in a database defined for ROSHARE, but the data set
cannot be accessed because it is not defined with SHAREOPTIONS(1,3).
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user. This reason code and the data set name are
made available to the user in the SQLCA or in messages.
System programmer response: Ensure that this data set belongs to a shared database, and check the
SHAREOPTIONS using IDCAMS LISTCAT. If so, use AMS ALTER SHAREOPTIONS to alter the data set to
SHAREOPTIONS(1,3), and resubmit the failing application.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00C2010C
Explanation: DB2 was unable to update the high-used RBA in the VSAM volume data set (VVDS) when it was
ready to close a data set. VVDS must be updated to reflect data loaded by a RECOVER, LOAD, or REORG utility job.
Message DSNB200Iis issued to the console with the VSAM media manager return codes.
This reason code and the data set name are recorded in the cursor table (CT) and made available in the SQLCA or in
messages.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user. A DSNB200Imessage is issued to the console.
DB2 continues to close the data set.
System programmer response: Refer to system messages IEC161I and DB2 message DSNB200A for assistance in
determining the cause of the error. Correct the condition, and notify the user to reinvoke the application.
User response: Contact the system programmer. Restart or rerun the RECOVER, LOAD, or REORG job after the
system programmer corrects the error.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v IDCAMS LISTCAT output for the ICF (VSAM) catalog that contains the DB2 subsystem catalog that defined the
failing index or table.
v IDCAMS LISTCAT output that shows the attributes of all active log data sets for the DB2 member that failed.
00C2010D
Explanation: DB2 was unable to open a required data set because an unexpected level ID was encountered.
The reason code and the data set name are made available in the SQLCA or in messages.
System action: A 'resource unavailable' code is returned to the user. Message DSNB232I is issued to the console if it
was not already issued for the data set. DB2 failed to open the data set.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Refer to message DSNB232I for help in determining the cause of the error. Run the
utility REPAIR LEVELID or recover the table space or index, and then tell the user to rerun the application.
Problem determination:
00C2010E
Explanation: This is a DB2 internal error. DB2 encountered a problem while trying to add a page to the logical page
list (LPL).
System action: The requesting execution unit is abended.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer, print SYS1.LOGREC, and request an SVC dump.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
00C2010F
Explanation: This dump provides assistance for diagnosing the page latch timeout problem after 00C20031 is
returned as the reason code for 'resource not available'.
System action: The requesting execution unit is abended to take a diagnostic dump then recovered to return an
SQLCODE -904 (resource not available) to the user with the 00C20031 reason code. The resource name is also
provided.
User response: Contact the system programmer to determine why the resource is unavailable. Print the
SYS1.LOGREC and the SVC dump.
00C20110
Explanation: DB2 cannot access a table space, index, or partition because the highest formatted page (as recorded by
DB2 in the header page) is higher than that derived from the VSAM high-used RBA.
The reason code and the data set name for this error are available in the SQLCA or in messages.
System action: DB2 returns a 'resource unavailable' code to the user.
System programmer response: To enable access to the object, take one of the following actions:
v Restore the object to a consistent state with the RECOVER or REBUILD utility, DSN1COPY, or some other means.
v Replace the data using the LOAD REPLACE utility.
v Allow access to the data in its current state. Use the REPAIR LEVELID utility to reset the high-used page number
in the header page to be consistent with the VSAM high-used RBA. This may result in inconsistent data.
Problem determination: Determine the high-formatted page number in the header page by running DSN1PRNT
with the FORMAT option, and checking the value of HPGHPREF.
You can also determine the VSAM high-used RBA by running an IDCAMS LISTCAT on the data set.
00C20111
Explanation: DB2 attempted to access a striped data set with a page size of 8 KB, 16 KB, or 32 KB. The data set is
defined with a 4 KB control interval (CI) size. DB2 does not allow this because partial writes cannot always be
detected.
System action: SQLCODE -904 is returned. The SQLCA contains a resource-not-available reason code and the data
set name.
System programmer response: Ensure that the data set is defined with a control interval size that matches its page
size.
User response: Convert the control interval size of the associated table space from 4 KB to a control interval size
that matches the page size. The REORG TABLESPACE, LOAD REPLACE, or RECOVER utility can be used to convert
the control interval size for the table space.
Problem determination: Run access method services LISTCAT to determine the data set attributes.
00C20112
Explanation: An attempt was made to access a DB2 data set which was defined with incompatible Control Interval
(CI) size. A compatible CI size is either 4K or the page size.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user. This reason code and the data set name are
made available to the user in the SQLCA.
System programmer response: Ensure that the data set is defined with the compatible CI size.
User response: Convert the data set attribute 'control interval size' of the associated table space from 4K CI into the
one matching the page size. DB2 Utilities REORG table space, LOAD with REPLACE, and RECOVER can be used to
convert the table space.
Problem determination: Obtain an access method services LISTCAT for the named data set's attributes.
00C20113
Explanation: DB2 reached the limit for concurrent open data sets. The OPEN statement fails with this reason code
when the number of concurrent open data sets reaches the greater of 32,768 or the value of the DSMAX subsystem
parameter.
System action: SQLCODE -904 is issued and the requested open is not performed. Reason code 00C20113 and the
data set name are recorded in the SQLCA. SVC dump and SYS1.LOGREC recording are not requested.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Take one of the following actions:
v Reduce the number of data sets that must be kept open by DB2 by limiting the amount of concurrent activity.
v Increase the value of the DSMAX parameter

00C20120
Explanation: This abend reason code is issued because of an unexpected return code from IWM4MREG,
IWM4MDRG, or IWM4MCHS.
System action: A dump is requested, then DB2 retries the abend and processing continues.
00C20200
Explanation: DB2 was unable to open a required index data set because the index was formatted incorrectly. For
example, it may have been formatted as a Type 1 index when the DB2 catalog indicates that it should be Type 2.
The reason code and index data set name are made available in the SQL communication area or in related messages.
System action: A 'resource unavailable' code is returned to the user.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Use the RECOVER utility to restore the index to a consistent state.
Problem determination:
00C20203
Explanation: DB2 cannot connect to a group buffer pool. The group buffer pool is not usable by this release of DB2.
This DB2 subsystem is a member of a data sharing group containing DB2 members of different release levels. A later
release level of DB2 specified an option for this group buffer pool that is not supported by the previous DB2 releases.
The presence of this option makes the group buffer pool inaccessible to the previous DB2 releases.
System action: DB2 takes the following actions:
v Unless already issued, message DSNB301E is sent to the console with this reason code to indicate that a connect
failure occurred.
v SQLCODE -904 (resource not available) is returned to the user with this reason code. The resource type and
resource name are also returned.
System programmer response: Take one of the following actions:
v Issue the -ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command from a DB2 that is at the later release level to remove the new
option so that previous release levels of DB2 can access the group buffer pool.
v Migrate the previous release levels to the current release.
User response: Contact the system programmer.
Problem determination:
00C20204
Explanation: DB2 is unable to connect to a group buffer pool because MVS detected a problem on the IXLCONN
request.
System action: SQLCODE -904 (resource not available) and the group buffer pool name are returned to the user.
Unless already issued for the IXLCONN code, message DSNB301E, which contains this reason code and the
IXLCONN code, is issued to the console.
User response: Contact the system programmer.
Problem determination: The reason code returned by the IXLCONN request is given in message DSNB301E.
If the connection problem was caused by insufficient storage in a coupling facility, tell the MVS system administrator
to alleviate the storage constraint problem by making additional storage available to the involved coupling facility, or
by changing the active MVS CFRM administrative policy to redefine the coupling facility structure to a different
coupling facility. Another alternative is to have the database administrator reassign those inter-DB2 sharing page sets
to a different DB2 buffer pool.

DSNB301E (DB2 Messages)
00C20205
Explanation: DB2 is unable to access a group buffer pool because of a damage assessment pending (DAP) status
against the group buffer pool.
System action: The action DB2 takes depends on the situation, as follows:
v If DB2 tries to read a page from the group buffer pool and finds that the group buffer pool is in DAP status, the
following actions are taken:
¨C SQLCODE -904 (resource not available) is returned to the user with this reason code. The name of the group
buffer pool is also returned.
v If DB2 tries to read a page from the group buffer pool for rollback, backout, or restart and finds that the group
buffer pool is in DAP status, the following actions are taken:
¨C The page is added to the logical page list (LPL) for the page set.
¨C Message DSNB250E is issued to the console with this reason code.
v If DB2 tries to write a page to the group buffer pool and finds that the group buffer pool is in DAP status, the
following actions are taken:
¨C The page is added to the logical page list (LPL) for the page set.
¨C Message DSNB250E is issued to the console with this reason code.
v If DB2 detects DAP status when it tries to connect the group buffer pool, or if DB2 detects a group buffer pool
version ID mismatch after a successful connection, the following actions are taken:
¨C The damage assessment process is triggered for this group buffer pool.
¨C SQLCODE -904 (resource not available) is returned to the user with this reason code. The name of the group
buffer pool is also returned.
¨C Unless already issued, message DSNB301E, which contains this reason code, is issued to the console.
System programmer response: Message DSNB304I is issued when the group buffer pool is entered into DAP state
and message DSNB305I is issued when the DAP status is cleared. During the damage assessment process, DB2 must
determine which page sets or partitions might have had changed pages in the failed coupling facility structure and
need to be recovered. Each page set/partition fitting this criteria is entered into 'group buffer pool REBUILD pending
(GRECP)' status. A page set/partition in GRECP status remains unavailable for read or update until it is recovered.
User response: Contact the system programmer.
00C20206
Explanation: An attempt was made to access a page which is currently in the logical page list (LPL). LPL pages are
unavailable until recovery on the affected page set completes.
System action: SQLCODE -904 (resource not available) is returned to the user with this reason code. The resource
name is also given.
System programmer response: For those page sets in the LPL, use the RECOVER utility or the -START DATABASE
command.
User response: Contact the system programmer.
Problem determination:
00C20207
Explanation: DB2 is unable to connect to a group buffer pool because of a DB2 system error during connect
processing. This is an internal DB2 problem.
System action: A SYS1.LOGREC entry is produced and an SVC dump is requested for the original abend which
caused this condition. After doing resource and latch recovery, DB2 retries the abend if retry is allowed. SQLCODE -904 (resource not available) is returned to the user with this reason code and the group buffer pool name. Unless
already issued, message DSNB301E, which contains this reason code, is issued to the console.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
00C20208
Explanation: The user attempted to access a group-buffer-pool-dependent page set or partition. However, the DB2
member was unable to connect to the group buffer pool because there was not enough hardware system area (HSA)
storage in which to allocate the local cache vector (LCV).
System action: DB2 disconnects from the group buffer pool and issues message DSNB301E with this reason code, if
it has not yet been issued. DSNB301E is usually preceded by a DSNB306I message.
SQLCODE -904 is returned to the user with this reason code.
System programmer response: Refer to message DSNB306I.
User response: Contact the system programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00C20210
Explanation: An attempt was made to access a page set or partition which is currently in group buffer pool
recovery pending (GRECP) status.
System action: SQLCODE -904 (resource not available) is returned with this reason code. The resource name is also
given. GRECP page sets or partitions remain unavailable until recovery against the affected page set or partition is
complete.
System programmer response: Use the START DATABASE command with the ACCESS RW option to recover the
page set or partition and remove the GRECP status. In extreme or unusual circumstances, you can also remove
GRECP status as follows:
v RECOVER, either to currency, or to a prior point in time
v REPAIR SET with NORCVRPEND
v LOAD REPLACE
v START DATABASE with ACCESS FORCE (Not recommended. Specifying this option can result in inconsistent
data.)
User response: Contact the system programmer to determine when the resource will be available for use.
00C20211
Explanation: DB2 is unable to access a group buffer pool because the group buffer pool is rebuilding, and the
attempt to access the group buffer pool timed out waiting for the rebuild to complete.
System action: 'Resource not available' return and reason codes are sent back to the requesting function.
System programmer response: Use the DB2 DISPLAY GROUPBUFFERPOOL command or the MVS D XCF,STR
command to monitor the status of the rebuild. Also, monitor the status messages that the DB2 members issue as the
rebuild progresses (refer to messages DSNB331I, DSNB332I, and DSNB338I). If the rebuild is not progressing
satisfactorally, you can use the MVS command SETXCF,STOP,REBUILD to stop the rebuild.
User response: Resubmit the request.
00C20220
Explanation: While DB2 was accessing a group buffer pool, MVS detected an environmental error during an
IXLCACHE request from DB2.
System action: The requesting execution unit abends.
Problem determination: The IXLCACHE reason code saved in register 8 can help determine the cause of the error.
Refer to MVS/ESA Programming: Sysplex Services Reference for the MVS IXLCACHE reason code.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
00C20221
Explanation: While accessing a group buffer pool, DB2 received an unexpected error from MVS, which detected an
invalid parameter on an IXLCACHE request from DB2. This code usually indicates a DB2 internal problem. However,
the problem can result from errors in other products.
System action: The requesting execution unit abends.
Problem determination: The IXLCACHE reason code saved in register 8 can help determine the cause of the error.
Refer to MVS/ESA Programming: Sysplex Services Reference for the MVS IXLCACHE reason code.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
00C20222
Explanation: While accessing a page in a buffer pool, DB2 received an unexpected error from MVS, which detected
an invalid parameter on an IXLVECTR request from DB2. This code usually indicates a DB2 internal problem.
However, the problem can result from errors in other products.
System action: The requesting execution unit abends.
Problem determination: See the IXLVECTR return code in register 8 to help determine the cause of the error. Refer
to MVS/ESA Programming: Sysplex Services Reference for the MVS IXLVECTR reason code.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
00C20223
Explanation: DB2 encountered an error while invoking the IXLCACHE macro.
System action: The requesting execution unit abends. DB2 terminates abnormally causing MVS to reset the castout
locks.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
00C20224
Explanation: DB2 received an unexpected return and reason code from the MVS IXLFCOMP macro for a group
buffer pool.
System action: DB2 abends the agent and requests a dump. If the group buffer pool is in duplex mode, then DB2
may stop duplexing for the group buffer pool in response to this error.
System programmer response: If the group buffer pool was duplexed and is entered back into simplex mode as a
result of this error, and duplexing is not automatically reestablished, then use the MVS SETXCF command to enter
the group buffer pool back into duplex mode if duplexing is needed. If DUPLEX(ENABLED) is specified in the active
CFRM policy for the group buffer pool, then the system attempts to automatically reestablish duplexing for the
structure.
Problem determination: See MVS/ESA Programming: Sysplex Services Reference for an explanation of the MVS
IXLREBLD reason code.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
00C20230
Explanation: DB2 could not establish duplexing for a group buffer pool because a coupling facility with CFLEVEL =
5 functionality was not available in which to allocate the secondary group buffer pool.
System action: The group buffer pool is entered back into simplex mode. Message DSNB741I is issued indicating
the reason code as the reason why the process to establish duplexing failed.
System programmer response: Upgrade the coupling facilities to CFLEVER = 5 or above. Or change the PREFLIST
for the group buffer pool to name only coupling facilities that have CFLEVER = 5 functionality.
00C20231
Explanation: DB2 could not establish duplexing for a group buffer pool because the primary structure instance of
that group buffer pool is allocated in a coupling facility that does not have CFLEVEL = 5 functionality.
System action: The group buffer pool is entered back into simplex mode. Message DSNB741I is issued indicating
the reason code as the reason why the process to establish duplexing failed.
System programmer response: Upgrade the coupling facilities to CFLEVER = 5 or above. Or change the PREFLIST
for the group buffer pool to name only coupling facilities that have CFLEVER = 5 functionality.
00C20232
Explanation: DB2 could not establish duplexing for a group buffer pool because the group buffer pool is defined
with GBPCACHE(NO). DB2 does not allow GBPCACHE(NO) group buffer pools to be duplexed.
System action: The group buffer pool is entered back into simplex mode. Message DSNB741I is issued indicating
the reason code as the reason why the process to establish duplexing failed.
System programmer response: If duplexing is needed for the group buffer pool, issue the DB2 ALTER
GROUPBUFFERPOOL command to specify GBPCACHE(YES) before trying to initiate duplexing.
00C20233
Explanation: DB2 detected a version id mismatch for the secondary group buffer pool when connecting to a
duplexing group buffer pool. The version ID mismatch indicates that the process to establish duplexing completed
prematurely (for example due to a system failure), and the secondary group buffer pool is not in synch with the
primary.
System action: DB2 stops duplexing for the group buffer pool. The group buffer pool is entered back into simplex
mode. Message DSNB743I is issued indicating the reason code as the reason why the process to establish duplexing
was stopped. If DUPLEX(AUTO) is specified for the group buffer pool in the active CFRM policy, then duplexing is
automatically reinitiated.
System programmer response: If duplexing is needed for the group buffer pool and duplexing is not automatically
reinitiated, then use the MVS SETXCF command to initiate duplexing for the group buffer pool.
00C20250
Explanation: A conditional pageset P-lock request failed.
User response: Contact IBM Software Support.
00C20251
Explanation: DB2 is unable to obtain a physical lock (P-lock) because of an out-of-storage condition detected by
IRLM.
System action: SQLCODE -904 is returned to the user with this reason code. This reason code and the resource
name are returned in the cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in the SQLCA.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: IRLM exhausted the amount of virtual storage available to it to represent locks.
Refer to code 00C90092 for methods to reduce the storage needed by IRLM.
Problem determination:
00C20252
Explanation: DB2 is unable to obtain a physical lock (P-lock). Another DB2 holds the P-lock in an incompatible
state, but is unable to downgrade because it does not have access to the corresponding group buffer pool.
System action: SQLCODE -904 (resource not available) is returned to the user. The other DB2 produces additional
diagnostic information in the form of messages, trace records, SYS1.LOGREC entries, and/or an SVC dump. This
reason code and the resource name are returned in the cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in the
SQLCA.
Problem determination:
00C20254
Explanation: DB2 is unable to acquire or upgrade a physical lock (P-lock) because of an incompatible retained lock
held by one or more other DB2 subsystems in the DB2 data sharing group. Retained locks are locks that persist
across DB2 abnormal terminations.
System action: SQLCODE -904 is returned to the user. This reason code and the resource name are returned in the
cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in the SQLCA.
System programmer response: Use the -DISPLAY DATABASE command to display the DB2 member names owning
the retained locks. You must restart those subsystems to remove the 'resource unavailable' condition. To show the
status of the DBMS and IRLM subsystems, you can use the following command:
F irlmproc,STATUS,ALLD
00C20255
Explanation: DB2 is unable to obtain a physical lock (P-lock) because another member holding the lock has not
responded to the P-lock request. This is a DB2 internal error.
System action: SQLCODE -904 (resource not available) is returned to the user. This reason code and the resource
name are returned in the cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in the SQLCA. The other DB2 produces
additional diagnostic information in the form of messages, trace records, SYS1.LOGREC entries and/or an SVC
dump.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
00C20256
Explanation: DB2 is unable to obtain a physical lock (P-lock). This is a DB2 internal error.
System action: SQLCODE -904 (resource not available) is returned to the user. This reason code and the resource
name are returned in the cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in the SQLCA. The other DB2 produces
SYS1.LOGREC entries, and, depending on the type of abend, might also produce an SVC dump.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
00C20257
Explanation: DB2 is unable to obtain a physical lock (P-lock) because of an 'out of record list storage' condition that
IRLM detected. The record list is that part of the coupling facility lock structure that IRLM uses to record 'modify
locks' (those locks that would be retained in case of a failure).
System action: SQLCODE -904 is returned to the user with this reason code. This reason code and the resource
name are returned in the cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in the SQLCA.
System programmer response: Allocate a larger coupling facility lock structure by using the MVS SETXCF,REBUILD
command. Make sure that the active MVS CFRM policy specifies a larger structure size for the IRLM coupling facility
lock structure before you initiate the rebuild. You can use the MVS SETXCF,STOP,POLICY and SETXCF,START,POLICY
commands to change the active MVS CFRM policy. If lock size is not already at the current POLICY maximum size,
you can increase lock size with the SETXCF START, ALTER, STRNAME=lock_structure, SIZE=new_size command.
00C20258
Explanation: DB2 is not able to obtain a physical lock (P-lock) until a peer member restarts. Another DB2 holds the
P-lock in an incompatible state but cannot downgrade until it completes its restart.
System action: SQLCODE -904 (resource not available) is returned to the user. This reason code and the resource
name are made available to the user in the SQLCA.
User response: Resubmit the failing application. The P-lock becomes available after the peer member completes its
restart processing.
Problem determination:
00C20259
Explanation: This is a DB2 internal error. This reason code and the group buffer pool name are recorded in the
cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in the SQLCA or in messages.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user. Abend status is recorded in SYS1.LOGREC.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer, print the SYS1.LOGREC, and request the SVC dump.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
00C2025A

00C20262
Explanation: This is a DB2 internal error. Castout was unsuccessful due to errors in writing a page to DASD.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination:
00C20263
Explanation: This is a DB2 internal error. Castout was unsuccessful due to an unexpected error.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user. An SVC dump and the SYS1.LOGREC
recording were requested.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination:
00C20264
Explanation: DB2 is unable to acquire or upgrade a physical lock (P-lock) because at least one other DB2 subsystem
in the data sharing group is holding an incompatible retained lock. The amount of time this DB2 can wait for a
locked resource was exceeded. This reason code is only issued if the RETLWAIT installation parameter in DSN6SPRM
is set to 'YES'. If RETLWAIT is set to 'NO' (this is the default), then any IRLM lock that conflicts with a retained lock
will not wait, but instead will be immediately rejected (see reason code 00C20254).
System action: An SQLCODE -904, -911 , -913 or -923 is issued, and message DSNT501I is issued. Also, message
DSNT378I is issued.
System programmer response: Refer to the 'System Programmer Response' in message DSNT378I.
Problem determination:
00C20267
Explanation: DB2 is unable to recover GRECP status for a table space or index because one or more sharing group
members could not perform a global drain request on the object.
System action: A DB2 message of DSNB350 or DSNB351 is issued.
System programmer response: Refer to the 'System Programmer Response' in message DSNB350 or DSNB351.
User response: Issue a START DB command to explicitly recover the page set from GRECP/LPL status.
00C20268
Explanation: DB2 is unable to recover GRECP status for a table space or index because one or more sharing group
members could not perform a global drain request on the object. One or more peer DB2s in the group failed to drain
the object because some error occurred.
System action: A DB2 message of DSNB350 or DSNB351 is issued.
System programmer response: Refer to the 'System Programmer Response' in message DSNB350 or DSNB351.
User response: Issue a START DB command to explicitly recover the page set from GRECP/LPL status.
00C20269
Explanation: An application or utility is attempting to access DB2 data, but this is not allowed because DB2 was
started in System Recover Pending mode. When DB2 is started in System Recover Pending mode, nothing other than
the Restore System utility is allowed to access DB2 data.
System action: The application fails with a "resource unavailable" condition.
System programmer response: The application cannot be run while DB2 is in System Recover Pending mode.
00C2026A
Explanation: DB2 is unable to obtain a physical lock (P-lock), because another member holding the lock has been in
DB2 shutdown mode for an extended amount of time.
System action: SQLCODE -904 (resource not available) is returned to the user. This reason code, as well as the
resource name, are returned in the cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in the SQLCA.
Problem determination: Check the other members of the data sharing group to find the one which is stalled in
shutdown. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying
and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference. Resubmit
the failing application after the member has come down.
00C2026B
Explanation: DB2 is unable to obtain a physical lock (P-lock), because another member holding the lock has had
logging suspended for an extended amount of time. The logging has been suspended because the active logs are full,
or because there is an outstanding SET LOG SUSPEND command.
System action: SQLCODE -904 (resource not available) is returned to the user. This reason code, as well as the
resource name, are returned in the cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in the SQLCA.
Problem determination: Check the other members of the data sharing group to find the one that has logging
suspended. Then take the appropriate action by either issuing the SET LOG RESUME command or freeing up the
active log data sets. Resubmit the failing application after the logging situation is resolved.
00C2026C
Explanation: DB2 is unable to obtain a physical lock (P-lock), because another member holding the lock has
encountered an abend in its P-lock exit.
System action: SQLCODE -904 (resource not available) is returned to the user. This reason code, as well as the
resource name, are returned in the cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in the SQLCA. The other DB2
produces additional diagnostic information in the form of messages, trace records, SYS1.LOGREC entries, or an SVC
dump.
Problem determination: Collect the SYS1.LOGREC and SVC dump, if available, from the other DB2. If the problem
persists, it might be necessary to recycle this member to resolve the P-lock failure.
00C202A1
Explanation: DB2 encountered an unexpected error while trying to read from or write to the shared
communications area (SCA).
System action: The requesting execution unit abends. A SYS1.LOGREC entry is written and an SVC dump is
requested.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
00C202A2
Explanation: MVS returned an unexpected error from an IXLDISC request to disconnect a group buffer pool.
System action: The requesting execution unit abends. A SYS1.LOGREC entry is written and an SVC dump is
requested. The IXLDISC reason code is saved in register 8 for SYS1.LOGREC recording and the SVC dump.
System programmer response: Refer to MVS/ESA Programming: Sysplex Services Reference for the MVS IXLDISC
reason code.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
00C202A3
Explanation: MVS returned an unexpected error from an IXLFORCE request to deallocate a group buffer pool.
System action: A SYS1.LOGREC entry is written and an SVC dump is requested. The IXLFORCE reason code is
saved in register 8 for SYS1.LOGREC recording and the SVC dump.
System programmer response: Refer to MVS/ESA Programming: Sysplex Services Reference for the MVS IXLFORCE
reason code.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
00C202A4
Explanation: MVS detected an error on an IXLCONN request from DB2.
System action: A SYS1.LOGREC entry is written and an SVC dump is requested. Unless already issued, message
DSNB301E, which contains this reason code, is issued to the console. The IXLCONN reason code is saved in register
8 for SYS1.LOGREC recording and the SVC dump. This reason code and the group buffer pool name are returned to
the user in the SQLCA.
System programmer response: Refer to MVS/ESA Programming: Sysplex Services Reference for the MVS IXLCONN
reason code.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
00C202A5
Explanation: The cache coupling facility structure attributes passed back by MVS on an IXLCONN request were
incorrect.
System action: A SYS1.LOGREC entry is written. The newly-connected group buffer pool is disconnected.
If this is a non-rebuild connect, then message DSNB301E, which contains this reason code, is issued to the console
(unless it has already been issued). In the message this reason code and the group buffer pool name are returned to
the user in the SQLCA.
If this is a rebuild connect, then message DSNB330E, which contains this reason code, is issued to the console and
this reason code is used to stop the rebuild.
Problem determination: Check the SYS1.LOGREC variable recording area (VRA) for which bit is set in ¡°VRARRK30
- Error mask¡±:
X'04' If bit X'04' is set, the number of allocated data elements was not sufficient to hold a single data page.
VRARRK31 contains the allocated number of data elements. The number of required data elements depends
on the page size of the buffer pool:
Page size Number of data elements
4KB 1
8KB 2
16KB 4
32KB 8
X'10' If bit X'10' is set, the allocated vector was not long enough to cover the corresponding buffer pool.
VRARRK31 contains the requested vector length, and VRARRK32 contains the allocated vector length.
X'20' If bit X'20' is set, the data element size was not allocated as DB2 requested. VRARRK31 contains the
requested data element size, and VRARRK32 contains the allocated data element size.
00C202A6
Explanation: This is a DB2 internal error. Unless already issued, message DSNB301E, which contains this reason
code, is issued to the console.
System action: A SYS1.LOGREC entry is written and an SVC dump is requested. The newly-connected group buffer
pool is disconnected. This reason code and the group buffer pool name are returned to the user in the SQLCA.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
00C202A7
Explanation: While processing an ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command request, DB2 encountered an unexpected
return code from the MVS IXCQUERY service.
System action: The requesting execution unit abends. A SYS1.LOGREC entry is written. An SVC dump is requested
if it appears to be a DB2 problem (return code 8 from IXCQUERY). Command processing is terminated.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
00C202A8
Explanation: In connection to a group buffer pool structure, DB2 determined that insufficient space is allocated to
hold any data pages. For example, the group buffer pool GBP32K contains only 16 KB or four 4 KB pages, which are
not large enough to support one 32 KB buffer.
System action: DB2 disconnects from the structure, issues a DSNB301E message with this reason code (if not
already issued), and returns this reason code and the GBP name to the user in the SQLCA. If this is a rebuild
connect, then DB2 issues message DSNB335I, which contains this reason code, and this reason code is used to stop
the rebuild.
System programmer response: Modify the z/OS coupling facility resource management (CFRM) policy to make the
group buffer pool structure larger, or use the -ALTER GROUPBUFFERPOOL command to reduce the value of the
RATIO option to assign more space for data.

00C50109
Explanation: An error probably occurred in DB2 while it attempted to process a TERMINATE request from the DSN
command processor. DSN received an unexpected return code (FRBRC1 or FRBRC2) from DB2.
System action: Immediately after writing this message, DSN abends with an abend code of X'04E' and an abend
reason code of '00C50109'.
System programmer response: See the Problem Determination section of this message.
User response: If the problem persists, notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Rerun the job with DSN tracing turned on. You may need a SYSUDUMP from the TSO
address space. You probably need a DB2 dump. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the
problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2
Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v SYSABEND, SYSUDUMP, or SYSMDUMP output.
v Listing of the DSNTRACE data set for the DSN (TSO attachment facility) session involved in the problem.

Explanation: This is a DSN command processor error. It occurs when the DSN STAX routine (DSNEBP01) is entered
and the DSN control blocks cannot be located; the AEPLUSR field did not contain the CIB address.
System action: The DSN command processor abended.
User response: If you allocated a SYSUDUMP or SYSABEND dump data set, collect the dump. Otherwise, allocate
SYSUDUMP and DSNTRACE data sets, turn on DSN tracing, and try to re-create the error. Save these data sets.
Severity: 4
00C50111
Explanation: Your application program made an instrumentation facility component application program interface
(instrumentation facility interface) call to DB2 language interface module DSNELI, but your application program was
not running under the DSN command processor. You must run all application programs using DSNELI under DSN.
To do this, first issue the DSN command, then start your application using the RUN subcommand of the DSN
command processor, and finally, when the application completes, stop DSN with an END subcommand.
System action: Control returns to the application. Your application can continue processing. Further attempts at
instrumentation facility interface (IFI) calls will continue to produce this return and reason code.
Operator response: Notify your system programmer.
System programmer response: Modify the job to invoke DSN. Initiate? the application program using the RUN
subcommand of the DSN command processor.
User response: Rerun your application under the DSN command processor.
00C60001
Explanation: DB2 received return code X'20' when issuing a WTO request to display a DB2 console message. MVS
sets this return code when there are no message buffers for either Multiple Console Support (MCS) or JES3, or when
there is a JES3 WTO staging area excess. The WTO request is terminated. The current DB2 console message and all
subsequent DB2 informational console messages are ignored until the MVS problem is corrected.
At the time of the abend, general register zero contains the return code from WTO request.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC. A retry is requested and execution continues. DB2 resumes
issuing console messages when the condition is corrected.
00C89011
Explanation: An internal parser consistency check failed. The parser received a token code of 0 from a lexical scan.
A lexical scan refers to a scan of words rather than syntax.
System action: An S04E abend is generated. The error type and reason code are found in register 15 of the dump.
System programmer response: Obtain the SVC dump and a copy of the application program source.
00C89012
Explanation: An internal precompiler or parser consistency check failed. An error occurred in storage suballocation
control blocks. This error can be caused by a DB2 SQL statement exceeding limitations. For example:
v An SQL statement might be referencing, creating, or declaring more columns than the DB2 defined maximum
number allowed for an SQL statement.
v Too many host variables might be referenced in an SQL statement.
System action: An S04E abend is generated. The error type and reason code are found in register 15 of the dump.
System programmer response: Obtain the SVC dump and a copy of the application program source.
00C89013
Explanation: An internal precompiler or parser consistency check failed. An error occurred in storage suballocation
request. Possible causes for this error include:
v Storage constraints when building the DBRM entry for the SQL statement
v An SQL statement exceeding the DB2 maximum statement length.
System action: An S04E abend is generated. The error type and reason code are found in register 15 of the dump.

System action: An S04E abend is generated. The error type and reason code are found in register 15 of the dump.
System programmer response: Obtain the SVC dump and a copy of the application program source.
00C89015
Explanation: An internal precompiler or parser consistency check failed. The host variable information in the
precompiler or parser dictionary or in the DBRM is not consistent with host variable information for an SQL
statement. This error might occur when the precompiler misinterprets an invalid host variable declaration.
System action: An S04E abend is generated. The error type and reason code are found in register 15 of the dump.
System programmer response: Obtain the SVC dump, a copy of the application program source, and a copy of the
DBRM that is being bound (IEBCOPY).
00C89016

available.
System action: An S04E abend is generated. The error type and reason code are found in register 15 of the dump.
System programmer response: Obtain the SVC dump and a copy of the application program source.
00C89041
Explanation: More storage is needed, but could not be obtained during the precompiler execution. An S04E abend
occurs. The error type and reason code are found in register 15 of the dump.
System programmer response: The storage required for the current statement could not be acquired or exceeds the
maximum (64KB) for a single request. If the region is full, determine if the region can be expanded. If it cannot be
expanded, the SQL statement is too large to be processed.
00C9000A
Explanation: A resource was unavailable in one of the following circumstances:
v The DB2 database manager attempted to read the log for a READS request for IFCID 0306.
v Information about the maximum length of LOB column data in the SPT01 directory table space was not available
because the DB2 catalog and directory was undergoing point-in-time recovery. This reason code is generated as
part of DISPLAY GROUP output.
User response: If the resource was unavailable when the database manager attempted to read the log for a READS
request for IFCID 0306, reissue the request. If the problem persists, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
If the resource was unavailable because information about the maximum length of LOB column data in the SPT01
directory table space was not available, no action is necessary.

Explanation: This message is used internally to pass back the condition to RDS and Utilities. This message is an
internal reason code. No response is necessary.
00C90060
Explanation: On a READS request, the return area supplied was not large enough to hold one log record. No log
record is returned, but the position is held in the log.
System action: The requested operation (decompression) is not performed.
User response: Increase the size of the return area.
Problem determination: The system returns the size of the return area that is required in field IFCABSRQ of the
IFCA return area.
00C90063
Explanation: On a READS request for IFCID 306, log records are returned, but data is not decompressed as
requested.
Problem determination: See the reason code in field QW0306DG to determine why decompression was not
performed. For example, if you receive 00C90064, it means that the decompression dictionary changed since the log
record was written.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
00C90064
Explanation: The decompression dictionary changed since the log record was written. The log record is returned
with compressed data.
System action: The requested operation (decompression) is not performed.
User response: Specify a valid WQALLRBA value and reissue the request.
Problem determination: The specified RBA/LRSN value might be too old.
00C9006D
Explanation: This code is used internally between components. Look for prior abends and messages on the console
to determine the cause of the problem.
System programmer response: Locate the cause of the problem using the system dump, the LOGREC data set, the
console log, or the job output. If you cannot determine the cause of the problem using these resources, contact an
IBM service representative.

Problem determination: The requested operation is not performed. An SQLCODE -904 or -923 is issued, and/or
message DSNT501I is issued. The resource allocated to the DB2 utility function might be either in use by a utility or
reserved for a utility. If the resource is reserved for a utility, but not currently in use, the -DISPLAY UTILITY
command will indicate that no utilities are operating on that object. To access a resource that is reserved for a utility,
use the -TERM UTILITY command.

Explanation: An attempt was made to allocate a resource for update operations. However, the resource is already
allocated to a DB2 utility function that allows other users to have read-only access.
System action: DB2 determines whether there is a utility function that would prohibit allocation of the resource. If it
finds an indication of a such a utility, the allocation of the resource is not allowed.
User response: Determine when the resource is no longer restricted by a utility and is started for read/write access,
and rerun the job.
Problem determination: The requested operation is not performed. An SQLCODE -904 or -923 is issued, and/or
message DSNT501I is issued.
The resource allocated to the DB2 utility function might be either in use by a utility or reserved for a utility. If the
resource is reserved for a utility, but not currently in use, the -DISPLAY UTILITY command will indicate that no
utilities are operating on that object. The -DISPLAY DATABASE command shows which restrictive states DB2
assigned to the resource in question. Utilities set a restrictive state (for example, UTRO) on the resource that they are
processing, and then remove this state when the utility successfully completes. Therefore, if the -DISPLAY
DATABASE command is issued after the successful completion of the utility, the restrictive state set by the utility is
not displayed. To access a resource that is reserved for a utility, use the -TERM UTILITY command.

Explanation: The environmental descriptor manager (EDM) function of the data manager subcomponent did not
have enough storage in its pool or data space to retrieve the object. The object can be either a database descriptor
(DBD), a skeleton cursor table (SKCT), or a skeleton package table (SKPT). The object is identified by a DBD ID,
SKCT plan name, or SKPT package name.
System action: The requested operation is not performed.
User response: Invoke the application again. If, after several attempts, EDM still reports that not enough space is
available, take the following actions to reduce EDM storage requirements:
v Reduce the number of concurrent users that are using DB2.
v Try reducing the number of SQL statements in the plan or package and rebind.
v Try to simplify the database design. For example, reduce the number of partitions in the database.
If EDM storage shortage is a recurring problem, change the relevant subsystem parameters on installation panel
DSNTIPC to increase the EDM pool size definition. Increase the number of concurrent users and the number of
currently active databases. Then, restart DB2.
If a utility that uses a LISTDEF list was run and that list includes a large number of databases, the EDM DBD pool
might be full. To see the size of each database DBD, use the DISPLAY DATABASE command. If the EDM DBD pool
is full, decrease the size of your LISTDEF contents to eliminate this condition. If this condition occurs frequently,
increase the size of your EDM DBD pool. For guidance, see Calculating EDM pool size (DB2 Installation and
Migration).

Explanation: An attempt to lock a required resource failed.
System action: The operation is not performed.
User response: Wait for all jobs which hold a lock on the resource in an incompatible lock state to complete before
reissuing the failing statement.
Problem determination: The requested operation is not performed.
If the resource type is table space, table, or index, then issue the -DISPLAY DATABASE command with the LOCKS
option to get a list of jobs which currently hold locks on the required resource.
If the resource type is a package, then wait for BIND activity on that package to complete before reissuing the failing
request.

Explanation: DB2 received an out-of-storage indication from IRLM resulting from a lock, unlock, or lock change
request.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC only when an abend is issued. No dump is requested.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: IRLM has exhausted the amount of virtual storage available to it to represent locks.
Insufficient virtual storage remains to satisfy this request. You can use the IRLM startup procedure to determine the
amount of storage space available.
The current mix of transactions caused all available storage to be used. You can find the number of locks held by a
particular transaction by either using the DB2 performance trace facility or by performing IRLM tracing.
Determine what transactions were running and the number of locks they held. You might want to schedule some of
these transactions at a different time.
You can reduce the total number of page or row locks that applications concurrently hold by changing the locking
protocol on one or more table spaces. Use one of the following statements:
v ALTER TABLESPACE...LOCKSIZE ANY
v ALTER TABLESPACE...LOCKSIZE TABLESPACE
v LOCK TABLE
If application logic permits, reduce the number of page or row locks concurrently held for SELECT statements by
re-binding application plans with isolation level of cursor stability instead of repeatable read or read stability.
You can reduce the total number of LOB locks that applications concurrently hold by changing the locking protocol
on one or more LOB table space. Use one of the following statements:
v ALTER TABLESPACE...LOCKSIZE TABLESPACE
v LOCK TABLE statement

Explanation: A data set is in a different state than DB2 expects, which might occur as a result of the following
situations:
v A data set was deleted and redefined, but DB2 does not recognize the redefined data set.
v A previous DB2 failure damaged the data set in some way.
System action: The requested action is not performed. If the invoker of this module abends, a record is written to
SYS1.LOGREC, and the invoker might initiate a dump. If the invoker does not abend, no record is written, and no
dump is requested. If this occurs, an SQL return code is issued, or message DSNT500I is issued, or both. The data set
is placed in a stopped status unless the invoker of the module is a utility.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you do not have the current level of the data set, you must perform DB2 recovery
to return the data set to its expected state. See the Problem Determination section of this message to learn how to
determine the name of the data set to be corrected. Use the DISPLAY command to check the status of the data set. If
the data set is stopped, use the START command before performing recovery.
User response: If the code was received while processing a user table, DB2 determined that the data set is empty. A
DROP TABLESPACE statement followed by a CREATE TABLESPACE statement and a CREATE TABLE statement
defines the dropped table to DB2. Use the IDCAMS LISTCAT for the failing DB2 data set. Check the HI-USED-RBA
for this data set; if HI-USED-RBA = 0, the data set is empty.
Problem determination: This error is detected at a time when DB2 cannot determine the specific name of the data
set involved. However, the SQL return code or message DSNT500I provides the name of the table space or index
space where the data set resides. When the table or index space consists of a single data set, this is specific.
Otherwise, the system programmer must find the particular data set within the table or index space.

Explanation: An attempt was made during DB2 restart to access a page in order to apply a log record but DB2 was
unable to access the page. This abend reason code appears as the reason code in message DSNI001I.
System action: The restart of the named table space, index space, or partition is deferred by the subsystem.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Correct the problem, and then use either the -START DATABASE command or the
RECOVER utility to make the table space, index space, or partition available.
Problem determination: Examine previous messages on the console to determine why DB2 could not access the
page. One possible reason is that a back-level pack was mounted. That is, the page to which the log record applies
was not yet formatted by VSAM. DB2 does not extend data sets during restart.

Explanation: The page or row lock on the page or subpage identified by the NAME resource-name value in message
DSNT500I or DSNT501I caused the total number of page or row locks concurrently held to reach the installation
maximum number of page or row locks (NUMLKUS) allowed for a single agent in the system.
System action: The operation that encountered this condition is not executed. If a utility job encountered this
condition, the utility is stopped. Otherwise, any database updates for the statement that was executing are backed
out. Any database reads for the statement that was executing are not executed. The position of the cursor is
unpredictable.
Operator response: If a utility job encountered this resource unavailable condition, terminate the utility and restart
it after the cause of the resource unavailable condition has been corrected.
System programmer response: If the application should be able to run with the current page or row or locking
protocol and SQL statements, increase the NUMLKUS value for the installation to allow a higher limit of page or row
to be concurrently held by a single application. If a utility job encountered this resource unavailable condition, the
NUMLKUS value must be increased to accommodate the utility, because utilities are programmed to use the
minimum number of page or row locks possible.
User response: Rerun the application after correcting the cause of this resource unavailable condition.
Programmer response: Reduce the total number of page or row locks that the application concurrently holds by
changing the locking protocol on one or more of the table spaces to table space level locking. To do this, use the
ALTER ... LOCKSIZE TABLESPACE or LOCK TABLE statements.
Review the application to see if a different choice of SQL statements can be used to perform the same operation with
less concurrent access to multiple tables with page or row locking.
If application logic permits, reduce the number of page or row locks concurrently held for SELECT statements by
rebinding the application plan with isolation level of cursor stability instead of repeatable read or read stability, or
add more frequent commits.

Explanation: An attempt was made to allocate to a table space for update operations. However, the table space was
marked as 'image copy' required, and updates are not allowed. This condition occurs as a result of any of the
following operations:
v Running a REORG LOG NO or LOAD LOG NO utility on the table space without running a copy that specifies
FULL YES.
v Execution of a RECOVER utility which specifies the TORBA or TOCOPY options, without following it with the
required COPY utility.
v Execution of a -TERM UTILITY command on a COPY utility that failed during the copy phase or was active in the
copy phase. Until the COPY utility completes, SQL updates are not allowed because the the integrity of the data
would be compromised.
v Execution of a MODIFY RECOVERY utility after all back up copies of the table space or data set were deleted from
the SYSCOPY catalog table.
v Execution of an ALTER TABLESPACE LOGGED command after updates on a not logged tablespace.
System action: The allocation process is not allowed.
User response: Run the COPY utility. However, if the table space is to be used for read-only access, or if
recoverability of the data is not required, instead of taking a full image copy you can run the REPAIR utility and
request that the image copy required condition be removed.
Problem determination: The requested operation is not performed. An SQLCODE -904 and/or message DSNT501I
is issued.

Explanation: An attempt was made to increase read-only or write-access counts of the utility in process beyond the
maximum (255) allowed.
System programmer response: Determine why active utilities are in the stopped state. Use the -TERM UTILITY
command to terminate utilities and reduce the UIP (utility in process) counts. If no active utilities are indicated, then
use the -DISPLAY DATABASE command to show which table spaces or partitions are in a UTRO or UTRW state.
User response: Use the -DISPLAY UTILITY command to determine how many utility jobs are currently active. If a
number of utility jobs are active but not in the stopped state, notify the system programmer. If the utility jobs are
running, resubmit your job after they complete.
Problem determination: Message DSNT500I is issued. For more information, refer to the explanation of message
DSNT500I.
00C90099
Explanation: An attempt was made to load data into a partition, but the partition is full. Based on the high key
value specified in the index for each partition, utilities instructed Data Manager to load a record into the proper
partition. This required Data Manager to build a new page with a page number one higher than the last page in the
partition. However, this new page is in the next partition.
This situation usually occurs when a very large partition undergoes inserts and updates. When the table space or
partition is reorganized, the page set is deleted and redefined, and the free space and PCTFREE cause the partition to
expand. It might attempt to fit more data in the partition than the partition can now hold.
System action: The requested action is not performed.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Use the -TERM UTILITY command to terminate the load utility and reduce the UIP
(utility in process) counts.
User response: Redefine the high key values in the index and retry the load.
If you receive this code during a reorganization, query the catalog to check the PCTFREE and FREEPAGE values. You
might be able to decrease the amount of free space to allow the REORG utility to complete successfully.
Alternately, you can terminate the utility and recover the table space. This approach can be time-consuming, but does
not cause additional problems. When the recovery is complete, you can alter the partition key and run the
reorganization again.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v SYSPRINT output, including JCL, for the application program or batch job, and system messages that were issued.
Make sure that MSGLEVEL=(1,1) on the JOB statement so that all diagnostic information is sent to SYSPRINT.

Explanation: An attempt was made to create a system database which, according to the DBID space map, has
already been created. However, the catalog shows the database was not created. This discrepancy between the catalog
and the space map for DBIDs may be due to an unsuccessful migration.
System action: Database is not created.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Drop the database, then create it again. If this fails to resolve the error, follow the

Explanation: An attempt was made to place data into a partitioned table space, partition-by-growth table space,
index space, or fixed hash space, but the partition is full.
For a table space partition, the data to be inserted is based on the high-key value that is specified in the cluster
index. For an index space partition, the index entry to be inserted is also based on the high-key value that is
associated with the index.
System action: A ¡°resource not available¡± code is returned and the requested action is not performed. The SVC
dump and the SYS1.LOGREC recording are not requested.
System programmer response: Take one of the following actions:
v If you received this reason code with message DSNT501I, redefine the partition that is identified in that message
and resubmit the job.
v If you received this reason code for a hash table, new system pages cannot fit in the fixed hash space. To correct
this problem, reorganize the table space that contains the hash table to make room for system pages.
v If you received this reason code for a partition-by-growth table space, the problem might be that the number of
partitions cannot grow beyond the limit that is specified by MAXPARTITIONS. In this case, change the limit for
MAXPARTITIONS.
User response: Notify the system programmer.

Explanation: An attempt was made to insert data into a nonpartitioned table space or index space, but the table
space or index space is full. A nonpartitioned table space, index space or LOB table space can contain a maximum of
64GB of data. A LOB table space can contain as many as 254 data sets per table space.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user and the requested action is not performed. The
SVC dump and the SYS1.LOGREC recording are not requested.
System programmer response: The table space, index space, or LOB table space name is identified in the DSNT501I
message. If the object is a table space or LOB table space, run the REORG TABLESPACE utility to attempt to reclaim
additional free space. If the object is an index space, drop and re-create the index with a fewer number of SUBPAGEs.
If free space cannot be reclaimed, notify the database administrator to redistribute the data into different table spaces,
LOB tables spaces, or index spaces.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.

Explanation: The DB2 subsystem currently serves as a remote site tracker system. Users cannot have write access for
tracker systems, and a tracker DB2 will not allow the use of any SQL statement that requires write access.
System action: DB2 cannot process the operation.
System programmer response: None.
Problem determination: A tracker DB2 does not allow the use of any SQL statement that requires write access, such
as DDL, GRANT/REVOKE, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, or MERGE. DB2 issues SQLCODE -904 in conjunction with
this message. You can also find more information in the description for message DSNT501I, which DB2 issues along
with this reason code.
Additionally, a tracker DB2 does not allow the START DATABASE command to perform LPL/GRECP recovery. If
you attempt a START DATABASE command on a tracker DB2, DB2 will issue message DSNI005I with this reason
code.

Explanation: An attempt was made to decompress a compressed index page when moving the page to the
bufferpool. The compressed index page was in an inconsistent state.
System action: The decompression that was requested is not performed.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Recover the index page listed in the DSNT408I message and rerun the job. If the job
is still unsuccessful, then recover the entire index and rerun the job. If the job is still unsuccessful, then rebuild the
index.
Problem determination: The requested operation is not performed because the index page is in an inconsistent
state. An SQLCODE -904 is issued and message DSNT408I is issued. For more information, refer to the SQL return
code in SQL return codes, or to the description of the DSNT408I message in DB2 Messages.

Explanation: Access to the index is not allowed if the index is defined with the DESC attribute on a VARBINARY
column or a column with a distinct type that is based on a VARBINARY data type. Drop the index or alter the
column data type to a compatible data type such as CHAR FOR BIT DATA, VARCHAR FOR BIT DATA or BINARY,
and then rebuild the index.
System action: The operation is not allowed.
User response: Drop the index or alter the column data type, and then rebuild the index.
00C900BA
Explanation: A request for a drain lock for the resource identified by NAME in messages DSNT500I and DSNT501I
could not be granted. The request waited for a period longer than the maximum specified by the installation.
System action: The requested action is not performed. The Data Manager function that detected this condition
returns 'resource not available' to its caller.
System programmer response: See SQLCODE -913 or -911 and/or message DSNT501I, which accompany this abend
reason code.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: Wait for all jobs that hold a drain lock on the resource in an incompatible state to complete before
reissuing the failing statement. To display drain locks, issue a DISPLAY DB LOCKS command. In order to avoid a
potential deadlock, the application should either commit or roll back to the previous COMMIT.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.

00C900BC
Explanation: The statement depleted the record identifier (RID) storage available.
System action: The requested action is not performed.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Restructure the SQL statement so that fewer RIDs are needed. The best way to do
this is to split the statement into two or more SQL statements equivalent to the original statement. Also, in some
cases, increasing the virtual storage might eliminate the times when storage is depleted.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: SQL return code -904 and/or message DSNT500I is issued. For more information, refer to
the explanation of message DSNT500I.
00C900BE
Explanation: DB2 is unable to acquire a lock on a resource because a DB2 subsystem in the DB2 data sharing group
holds an incompatible retained lock on that resource. Retained locks are locks that persist across DB2 abnormal
terminations. After a successful restart of a DB2 member, retained locks can continue to exist for that member until
all postponed abort threads have been processed.
System action: The requested action is not performed. SQLCODE -904 is issued. A 'resource not available' code is
returned to the user. This reason code and the resource name are returned in the cursor table (CT) and made
available to the user in the SQLCA.
Problem determination: SYS1.LOGREC contains information in the variable recording area (VRA) of the system
diagnostic work area (SDWA). Significant fields for this code are: VRARRK13, VRARRK14, and VRARRK15.
00C900BF
Explanation: DB2 is unable to obtain a lock because IRLM detected an 'out of record list' storage condition. The
record list is that part of the coupling facility lock structure that contains the 'modify locks' (those locks that would
be retained in case of a failure).
System action: SQLCODE -904 is returned to the user with this reason code. This reason code and the resource
name are returned in the cursor table (CT) and made available to the user in the SQLCA. If it is active, an IFCID 0021 trace record is written and might contain additional diagnostic information.
System programmer response: If this becomes a prevalent problem, you will need to redistribute the coupling
facility lock structure storage resource to make more room for the record list. You can do this in one of two ways:
v Issue a rebuild.
v Dynamically change the lock structure size.

Explanation: A request for an internal lock could not be granted. The request waited for a longer period than is
allowed.
System action: The request action is not performed. A 'resource not available' reason code is returned to the caller.
System programmer response: See SQLCODE -911 or -913 and/or message DSNT500I, which accompany this
reason code. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying
and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: If the user is a DB2 utility, rerun or restart the utility. If it is a DB2 command, reissue the command.
DB2 applications should either commit or roll back to the previous commit, then retry from the commit point.
00C900C1
Explanation: An attempt was made to allocate an index that has one or more logical partitions in a rebuild pending
state.
System action: Use of the object is not allowed.
Operator response: Determine when the REBUILD utility should be run to complete recovering the object. Only the
logical partitions marked as rebuild pending need to be recovered.
User response: Determine when the resource is available for use and rerun the job.
Problem determination: The requested operation is not performed because the index might be in an inconsistent
state. An SQLCODE -904 or message DSNT501I is issued. For more information, refer to the SQL return code in
Part 1, ¡°SQL codes,¡± on page 1, or to the description of the DSNT501I.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and

Explanation: An attempt was made to access a table space that is in the auxiliary check pending state (ACHKP).
System action: The operation is not allowed. DB2 returns 'resource not available' to its invoker.
System programmer response: Use the CHECK DATA utility to identify the invalid LOBs. Use the SQL UPDATE
statement to replace the invalid LOBs or the SQL DELETE statement to remove the rows with the invalid LOBs. After
rectifying all invalid LOBs, run CHECK DATA again to clear the ACHKP state from the table space.
Problem determination: An SQLCODE -904 is issued. Message DSNT500I or message DSNT501I might also be
issued.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.

Explanation: DB2 detected an uncommitted read or write claim on an index being altered in the same commit
scope. When you use the PIECESIZE or COPY clause with the ALTER INDEX statement, then you need to have the
read or write claim committed BEFORE you complete the operation.
PIECESIZE does not allow an uncommitted write or read claim on the index.
COPY, set to YES or NO, does not allow an uncommitted write on the index.
Commit or rollback all changes to the index before using ALTER INDEX with one of these clauses.
System action: The ALTER INDEX statement is not allowed.
System programmer response: The requested operation is not performed and SQLCODE -904 is issued. For more
information, refer to the SQLCODE in "Section 2. SQL Return Codes". Commit or rollback changes to the index and
retry the ALTER INDEX statement.
Problem determination: The requested operation is not performed and SQLCODE -904 is issued. For more
information, refer to the SQL return code in "Section 2. SQL Return Codes."
00C900C7
Explanation: The requested function was either:
v not supported by the current release or maintenance level of DB2, or
v deactivated by a modified the system parameters.
In the former case, the NAME field of the accompanying message indicates the required level of maintenance. In the
latter case, the NAME field indicates the deactivating system parameter.
System action: The requested action is not performed.
System programmer response: To permit the use of the function, take the appropriate actions according to the
situation. Apply the indicated maintenance, migrate to the indicated release of DB2, or use an alternate setting for the
indicated system parameter.
User response: Inform the system administrator.
00C900C8
Explanation: Access to the index is disallowed within the same commit scope as an ALTER TABLE statement that
alters the key column in the index. If the ALTER TABLE statement failed, then commit the changes to the index and
retry the ALTER TABLE statement. If an INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, MERGE or SELECT statement failed, then
commit the ALTER and retry the statement.
System action: The operation is not allowed.
User response: Commit and then retry the operation.
00C900C9
Explanation: After being expanded to process triggers, a row has grown too large to fit into a 32K page of a
workfile.
System action: DB2 does not perform the requested operation.
Programmer response: Drop and re-create triggers to use less LOB columns as transition variables, or eliminate the
use of the ROWID column as a transition variable. For a table with LOB columns or a ROWID column whose row
size is very close to 32K, it may not be possible to use transition tables with triggers.
Problem determination: DB2 does not perform the requested operation. DB2 issues SQLCODE -904, and may also
issue message DSNT500I or DSNT501I.
Collect the following information:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of

Explanation: The data manager detected an internal error within DB2. Possible causes for this error include:
v Improper migration or fall back procedures.
v The DB2 directory and DB2 catalog have been restored to different points in time.
v A table space was restored improperly.
v An error in internal DB2 control structures or code.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested.
Operator response: Collect the console output from the system on which the job was run for the period of time
spanning the failure. Save this output for use in problem determination.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: If this abend occurred while processing data in one or more pages, message DSNI014I is
issued to identify each page involved. In general, the data in these pages is valid. However, if problems are reported
that repeatedly involve the same pages or if the same pages are reported by other abends, analyze the set of pages
specified.
Run the CHECK INDEX utility to determine the extent of index inconsistency if:
v The page type indicated in message DSNI014I is index.
v The page type indicated in message DSNI014I is data.
v An index is defined on a table in the indicated page set.
The LOC keyword in the dump title gives the load-module.csect-name:qualifier of the location where the abend
occurred. The value of qualifier is a unique, 4-digit hexadecimal number that identifies the place within the source
control module (CSECT) where the abend was issued.
SYS1.LOGREC contains information in the variable recording area (VRA) of the system diagnostic work area
(SDWA). Significant fields for this abend code are: VRARRK5, VRARRK6, VRARRK7, VRARRK8, and VRARRK9. The
name of the CSECT involved is given in VRARRK5. The full CSECT name given in the dump title.
The csect-name value in the associated message can indicate possible causes or actions:
DSNGxxxx
If the csect-name value begins with DSNG, regardless of the xxxx portion of the name, make a copy of
DSNDB01.DBD01, DSNDB01.SCT02, and DSNDB01.DSNSCT02 on tape with DSN1COPY. This might be a
large copy.
DSNIDBMF:5016
An object is already in UTUT status, and a utility is trying to place UTUT status on the same object. The
operation is denied with an abend. Two possible causes for this condition are:
v SYSUTILX was re-initialized and the pending states were not resolved for each object by running the
appropriate utility.
v Two utilities ran against the same object with UTUT status.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v Detailed description of events immediately prior to and during the abend.
v SYSPRINT output, including JCL, for the application program or batch job, and system messages that were issued.
Make sure that MSGLEVEL=(1,1) on the JOB statement so that all diagnostic information is sent to SYSPRINT.
v DB2 log output, including any DB2 recovery log archive tapes.
v DB2 REPAIR dump of the pages identified in DSNI014I messages.
v CHECK utility output.

00C90103
Explanation: Bad data was returned from either the edit or the validation exit.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: SYS1.LOGREC contains the same diagnostic information in the variable recording area
(VRA) as in abend reason code '00C90101'. Refer to the table accompanying that abend reason code for details.
The '00C90103' abend reason code was issued because one of the checks described in the following list failed:
v Save first and last byte of the input record. On return from exit, see if either group has been modified. If so, abend.
v Check length of edited data. If greater than maximum allowed for this row, or less than one, abend.
v Store a special character in the first byte past the end of the output area (place for edit procedure to put edited or
(original unedited) row), to make sure the exit doesn't overrun this area. On return, check if it is still the same
special character. If not, abend.
SYS1.LOGREC contains information in the variable recording area (VRA) of the system diagnostic work area
(SDWA). Significant fields for this code are: VRARRK5, VRARRK6, VRARRK7, VRARRK8, and VRARRK9.
00C90105
Explanation: An inconsistent page was detected. This has been caused by a DB2 internal error.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC, an SVC dump is requested, and the page will be scheduled for
automatic recovery. If automatic recovery is successful, message DSNB215I is issued. If automatic recovery fails,
message DSNI012I is issued, and an abend '04E' with reason code 00C90102 will occur.
Note: If the resource required for automatic recovery is in use, automatic recovery will be delayed until the resource
is available.
System programmer response: Check whether an application issues an ALTER TABLE statement and an INSERT
statement in the same commit scope. In such cases, you might resolve the situation by adding a COMMIT statement
between the ALTER TABLE and INSERT statements.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: SYS1.LOGREC contains information in the variable recording area (VRA) of the system
diagnostic work area (SDWA). Significant fields for this code are: VRARRK5, VRARRK6, VRARRK7, VRARRK8, and

00C90110
Explanation: The data manager detected an inconsistent data condition. This may be caused by an inconsistency in
either the DB2 catalog or the DB2 directory. In this case, the OBD for the requested OBID cannot be located in the
database descriptor (DBD). The DBD in storage may be inconsistent. Specifically, the OBDDMAP(OBID) array
element should contain an offset into the DBD where the OBD should be located. However, in this case the OBD
expected was not at the indicated offset.
To prevent further damage and possible loss of data, the inconsistency must be corrected before any further SQL
access is attempted to this database.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Determine which databases were being used when the error occurred. Prevent
further SQL access to the databases. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: The DBD in use at the time of the abend is inconsistent in storage and may be inconsistent
on DASD. Since the nature and extent of the damage done to the DBD is not immediately known, an analysis of the
entire DBD must be done.
The inconsistency may be due to:
v Incomplete recovery of DB2 catalog and/or DB2 directory.
v Invalid restore of DB2 catalog and/or DB2 directory to a prior point in time.
v A conditional restart which bypassed recovery of either the DSNDB01.DBD01 page set or the DSNDB06.SYSDBASE
page set.
v A DB2 internal error.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v Unformatted DSN1PRNT output of the DSNDB01.DBD01 page set. Use the method described in Part 5 of Diagnosis
Guide and Reference to locate the inconsistent DBD in the DSNDB01.DBD01 page set.
v The results of the following SQL statements, where dbid is the DBID of the damaged DBD:
SELECT * FROM SYSIBM.SYSINDEXES
WHERE DBID=dbid ORDER BY OBID;
SELECT * FROM SYSIBM.SYSINDEXES
WHERE DBID=dbid ORDER BY ISOBID;
SELECT * FROM SYSIBM.SYSTABLES
WHERE DBID=dbid ORDER BY OBID;
SELECT * FROM SYSIBM.SYSTABLESPACE
WHERE DBID=dbid ORDER BY OBID;
SELECT * FROM SYSIBM.SYSTABLESPACE
WHERE DBID=dbid ORDER BY PSID;
Use the results to compare the information in the DB2 catalog with the DBD. Determine which OBDs are
inconsistent with the DB2 catalog. Use Diagnosis Guide and Reference to analyze the DBD.
v DSN1LOGP output with DBID (1) OBID (1F) covering the period of time in which the DBD inconsistency might
have occurred. This period of time is approximately from the time of the abend back to the time when the DB2
catalog and DBD were believed to be consistent.
v Copy of the log for this period, so that additional DSN1LOGP reports can be produced for problem determination.
00C90111
Explanation: The data manager detected an inconsistent data condition. In this case, the OBD for the requested
OBID does not exist. This may be caused by an inconsistency in either the DB2 catalog or the DB2 directory.
Specifically, the OBDDMAP(OBID) entry is zero rather than an offset to an OBD within the DBD.
To prevent further damage and possible loss of data, the inconsistency must be corrected before any further SQL
access is attempted to this database.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Determine which databases were being used when the error occurred. Prevent
further SQL access to the databases. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Since the DB2 directory does not agree with the DB2 catalog, either of these may be
inconsistent. Since the nature and extent of the inconsistency between the DB2 catalog the DBD is not immediately
known, an analysis of the entire DBD must be done.
The inconsistency may be due to:
v Incomplete recovery of DB2 catalog and/or DB2 directory.
v Invalid restore of DB2 catalog and/or DB2 directory to a prior point in time.
v A conditional restart which bypassed recovery of either the DSNDB01.DBD01 page set or the DSNDB06.SYSDBASE
page set.
v A DB2 internal error.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of

v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v Unformatted DSN1PRNT output of the DSNDB01.DBD01 page set. Use the method described in Part 5 of Diagnosis
Guide and Reference to locate the inconsistent DBD in the DSNDB01.DBD01 page set.
v The results of the following SQL statements, where dbid is the DBID of the damaged DBD:
SELECT * FROM SYSIBM.SYSINDEXES
WHERE DBID=dbid ORDER BY OBID;
SELECT * FROM SYSIBM.SYSINDEXES
WHERE DBID=dbid ORDER BY ISOBID;

SELECT * FROM SYSIBM.SYSTABLESPACE
WHERE DBID=dbid ORDER BY OBID;
SELECT * FROM SYSIBM.SYSTABLESPACE
WHERE DBID=dbid ORDER BY PSID;
Use the results to compare the information in the DB2 catalog with the DBD. Determine which OBDs are
inconsistent with the DB2 catalog. Use Diagnosis Guide and Reference to analyze the DBD.
v DSN1LOGP output with DBID (1) OBID (1F) covering the period of time in which the DBD inconsistency might
have occurred. This period of time is approximately from the time of the abend back to the time when the DB2
catalog and DBD were believed to be consistent.
v Copy of the log for this period, so that additional DSN1LOGP reports can be produced for problem determination.
00C90112
Explanation: The data manager detected an inconsistent data condition. There may be more than one object with the
same OBID in the DB2 Catalog. To prevent further damage and possible loss of data, the inconsistency must be
corrected before any further SQL access is attempted to this database.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC and an SVC dump is requested.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Determine which databases were being used when the error occurred. Prevent

Problem determination: Since the extent of this inconsistency is not immediately known, an analysis of the entire
DBD must be done.
The inconsistency may be due to:
v Incomplete recovery of the DB2 Catalog and/or the DB2 Directory.
v Invalid restore of the DB2 Catalog and/or the DB2 Directory to a prior point in time.
v A conditional restart which bypassed recovery of the DSNDB01.DBD01 or DSNDB06.SYSDBASE table spaces.
v A DB2 internal error.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v Unformatted DSN1PRNT output of the DSNDB01.DBD01 page set. Use the method described in Part 5 of Diagnosis
Guide and Reference to locate the inconsistent DBD in the DSNDB01.DBD01 page set.
v The results of the following SQL statements, where dbid is the DBID of the damaged DBD:
SELECT * FROM SYSIBM.SYSINDEXES
WHERE DBID=dbid ORDER BY OBID;

WHERE DBID=dbid ORDER BY PSID;
Use the results to compare the information in the DB2 catalog with the DBD. Determine which OBDs are
inconsistent with the DB2 catalog. Use Diagnosis Guide and Reference to analyze the DBD.
v DSN1LOGP output with DBID (1) OBID (1F) covering the period of time in which the DBD inconsistency might
have occurred. This period of time is approximately from the time of the abend back to the time when the DB2
catalog and DBD were believed to be consistent.
v Copy of the log for this period, so that additional DSN1LOGP reports can be produced for problem determination.

Explanation: An attempt was made to apply prior-version/release DB2 log records other than checkpoint records.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested.
Operator response: Collect the console output from the system on which the job was run for the period of time
spanning the failure. Save this output for use in problem determination.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: This abend can occur in migration/remigration when some necessary migration/
remigration steps are skipped. It indicates that some DB2 activity occurred or was pending after the last complete
checkpoint on the prior system. If this was the cause of the problem, it can be corrected by falling back to the prior
version/release long enough to bring DB2 up, then bring it down while conforming to all migration/remigration
steps. Pay specific attention to resolving all indoubts and to performing a stop mode quiesce.

Explanation: The data manager has detected an inconsistent data condition. Either the length of a record in a table
space is longer than the maximum-defined record length as defined in the DB2 directory or a variable-length column
has a longer length than the length defined in the DB2 directory.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Message DSNI013I is issued to identify the data page that contains the record that is longer
than allowed by its corresponding record definition. This could occur if the DB2 directory was recovered to a
previous point, allowing new object creations (with a shorter record length) to be created having record identifiers
identical to objects previously created in the table space. Also the table space may have been improperly restored by
using DSN1COPY or the wrong data set may have been copied for the given table space.

00C9021C
Explanation: While running a utility, the data manager detected an inconsistent data condition. A row was
encountered that is not represented by a record OBD in the database descriptor (DBD). This abend may indicate an
internal DB2 error, but most likely occurs due to a user error. Possible user errors may include:
v Data from a DB2 subsystem was copied to another DB2 subsystem incorrectly. This is the most common error.
v DSNDB01.DBD01 was regressed to a time prior to a table being created.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC and an SVC dump is requested. The dump is required in the
event that the problem is determined to be a DB2 internal error.
System programmer response: Determine if improper procedures were used to restore the table space or DBD that
would lead to the inconsistency.

00C9021D
Explanation: During a LOAD/REORG utility or termination of a utility, the data manager detected an inconsistent
data condition. A space map page was missing from the table space. This abend may indicate an internal DB2 error
(caused by the utilities subcomponent passing a bad start position to the data manager), but most likely occurs due
to a user error. Possible causes are that the table space data set has been deleted and redefined without DB2's
knowledge, or that the table space was incorrectly restored from an improper DSN1COPY of the table space.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested. The dump is required in the
event that the problem is determined to be a DB2 internal error.
System programmer response: Determine if the data set was improperly restored or deleted and redefined by the
user. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Message DSNI013I will be issued. If the message information describes page 'xx0001'X of
the table space, this indicates that the data set was deleted and redefined without DB2's knowledge.

00C90222
Explanation: While starting DB2, the data manager detected a utility in process (UTUT, UTRO or UTRW) state on
an object that originated from Version 2 Release 3. This abend might indicate an internal DB2 error, but most likely
occurs because of a user error. A possible user error is a result of not terminating all utilities before migrating to this
release.
System action: The -START DB2 command fails. A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC and an SVC dump is
requested. The dump is required if the problem is determined to be a DB2 internal error.
System programmer response: Determine if an improper procedure was used to migrate to this release. If the
utilities were not terminated before migrating, fall back to Version 2 Release 3 and restart DB2. Use the -TERM
UTILITY command to terminate utilities, use the -DISPLAY UTILITY command to make sure no utility job is
currently active, stop DB2, and remigrate to this release.

Explanation: An attempt to make the database exception table (DBET) consistent failed after an agent failure.
System action: The DB2 subsystem abends, a record is written to SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested.
Problem determination: Restarting the member rebuilds the local DBET. Analyze SYS1.LOGREC and the dump to
determine why the agent failed and why the attempt to make the DBET consistent failed.
00C90304
Explanation: START DATABASE recovery of GRECP cannot proceed because the recover base RBA value in the
header page for the object is invalid. The following might have occurred:
v The data set was restored from an earlier release backup that does not have a starting RBA or LRSN in the header
page.
v DSN1COPY RESET utility command.
System action: The GRECP recovery for this object is terminated; all other objects being recovered by this START

is determined by the zparm keyword MAXTEMPS.
System action: The SQL statement was terminated with an SQLCODE -904 and this reason code.
User response: Examine the application and determine why the limit was exceeded.
Problem determination: An application used too much work file storage space. Examine the limit set for
MAXTEMPS. Adjust the limit as appropriate.
00C90306
Explanation: DB2 detected that Environmental Descriptor Manager (EDM) real-time statistic (RTS) information
cannot be externalized. The probable cause for this error is that the SYSTSPKG (or SYSPACKAGE, in CM8 or CM9
conversion modes) table space is in a state that does prevents updates.
System action: Statistics are discarded because they cannot be externalized.
A DSNT500I message is issued to identify the resource type and reason. Other messages might be issued, including
other instances of DSNT500I. The messages indicate that the EDM RTS cannot be externalized because SYSTSPKG is
in a state other than update.
User response: Make sure that the SYSTSPKG (or SYSPACKAGE, in CM8 or CM9 conversion modes) table space is
in a state that does not prevent updates. If it is in a state that does not prevent updates and this condition persists,
collect the information that is identified in the problem determination section.

00C90635
Explanation: An attempt was made to allocate to a table space partition for update operations. However, the table
space partition is in a Persistent Read Only (PRO) restricted status, and updates are not allowed. This condition
occurs as a result of using the REPAIR utility to set the PRO restricted status for the purpose of prohibiting updates.
System action: The allocation process is not allowed.
User response: Check with the DB2 system administrator and the database administrator. Do not remove the PRO
restricted status without their consent, because updates to the data might cause data loss.
Problem determination: The requested operation is not performed. SQL error code -904 or message DSNT501I is
issued.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.

Explanation: A specific table version record was not retrieved from the system page because the header page was
not available. This situation typically happens because of lock contention in a high concurrency environment.
System action: SQLCODE -904 is issued, and processing stops.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Lock contention usually resolves itself. Resubmit the job. If the problem persists, you
might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data

Explanation: DB2 detected an inconsistent condition. An entry in the auxiliary index was not found. The error is
probably caused by not recovering all table spaces in a table space set to the same point-in-time.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC and an SVC dump is requested.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis

00D10010
Explanation: The DB2 stand-alone log services OPEN processing macro (DSNJSLR) issues this reason code. The
RANGE parameter on the OPEN request specifies the address of a 12-byte area containing the log relative byte
address (RBA) range to be processed by subsequent GET requests. However, the RBA specified in the second six
bytes of the RANGE parameter (which indicates the end of the log RBA ) is less than or equal to the RBA specified in
the first six bytes of the RANGE parameter (which indicates the start of the log RBA).
System action: In response to the DSNJSLR FUNC=OPEN call, DB2 places a return code of 8 in register 15 and a
reason code of 00D10010 in register 0. No abend is issued by the stand-alone log services CSECT (DSNJRS01), and no
information is written to SYS1.LOGREC data set.
The stand-alone log services program is under the control of a user-written program that uses the DSNJSLR macro.
The user application program must therefore anticipate and react to a nonzero return code and a nonzero reason
code, possibly by terminating the execution of the user program.
System programmer response: Correct the RANGE RBA parameter input, and resubmit the request.

00D10011
Explanation: The DB2 stand-alone log services OPEN and GET processing macro (DSNJSLR) issued this reason
code. During the initial processing of a FUNC=OPEN or FUNC=GET request, storage is obtained to contain the
control blocks and other information required to process this request. An MVS GETMAIN failed when attempting to
obtain the required storage.
System action: In response to the DSNJSLR FUNC=OPEN or FUNC=GET call, DB2 places a return code of 8 in
register 15 and a reason code of 00D10011 in register 0. No abend is issued by the stand-alone log services CSECT
(DSNJRS01), and no information is written to SYS1.LOGREC data set.
The stand-alone log services program is under the control of a user-written program that uses the DSNJSLR macro.
The user program must therefore anticipate and react to a nonzero return code and a nonzero reason code, possibly
by terminating the execution of the user program.
System programmer response: In all likelihood, the REGION parameter on the EXEC statement for the user
program is too small. Increase the REGION size, and resubmit the user program.

00D10012
Explanation: The DB2 stand-alone log services OPEN processing macro (DSNJSLR) issued this reason code. The Job
Control Language (JCL) for the user program that uses the DSNJSLR macro must specify either the use of the
bootstrap data set (BSDS) or, in the absence of the BSDS, the active or archive data set(s) that is used in the
processing. The FUNC=OPEN request failed because the BSDS or a log data set is not allocated for the job.
If ACTIVEn or MxxACTn data sets are used, the supplied DD names must start with the number 1 and increment by
1. For example, you must use ACTIVE1, ACTIVE2, ACTIVE3, and so on. You cannot use ACTIVE2, ACTIVE7, and
ACTIVE9.
System action: In response to the DSNJSLR FUNC=OPEN call, DB2 places a return code of 8 in register 15 and a
reason code of 00D10012 in register 0. No abend is issued by the stand-alone log services CSECT (DSNJRS01), and no
information is written to SYS1.LOGREC data set.
The stand-alone log services program is under the control of a user-written program that uses the DSNJSLR macro.
The user program must therefore anticipate and react to a nonzero return code and a nonzero reason code, possibly
by terminating the execution of the user program.

Explanation: The DB2 stand-alone log services OPEN processing macro (DSNJSLR) issued this reason code. A
VSAM OPEN error occurred while opening the bootstrap data set (BSDS).
System action: In response to the DSNJSLR FUNC=OPEN call, DB2 places a return code of 12 in register 15 and a
reason code of 00D10013 in register 0. No abend is issued by the stand-alone log services CSECT (DSNJRS01), and no
information is written to SYS1.LOGREC data set.
Information about the results of the OPEN request is also returned in the stand-alone log GET Feedback Area (SLRF).
The VSAM OPEN error return code is placed in SLRFRG15. The ACB error code (ACBERFLG) is placed in
SLRFERCD.
The stand-alone log services program is under the control of a user-written program that uses the DSNJSLR macro.
The user program must therefore anticipate and react to a nonzero return code and a nonzero reason code, possibly
by terminating the execution of the user program.
System programmer response: Determine the meaning of the VSAM OPEN error returned in SLRFRG15, and the
ACB error code returned in SLRFERCD. Take appropriate action, and resubmit the FUNC=OPEN request.

00D10014
Explanation: The DB2 stand-alone log services OPEN processing macro (DSNJSLR) issued this reason code. The Job
Control Language (JCL) associated with the user-written application determines how access to the DB2 log data is
achieved. Access can either be through the bootstrap data set (BSDS), or through the explicit inclusion of ddnames in
the JCL for the active or archive log data set(s) which are to be examined. If the BSDS method is used, the user must
specify a RANGE parameter on the FUNC=OPEN call. This reason code indicates that the user used the BSDS
method, but did not specify the range of RBAs to be examined.
System action: In response to the DSNJSLR FUNC=OPEN call, DB2 places a return code of 8 in register 15 and a
reason code of 00D10014 in register 0. No abend is issued by the stand-alone log services CSECT (DSNJRS01), and no
information is written to SYS1.LOGREC data set.
The stand-alone log services program is under the control of a user-written program that uses the DSNJSLR macro.
The user program must therefore anticipate and react to a nonzero return code and a nonzero reason code, possibly
by terminating the execution of the user program.
System programmer response: Two choices are available:
1. Continue to use the BSDS method of access. If this choice is made, then the FUNC=OPEN invocation must
specify a range of RBAs to be examined by use of the RANGE parameter.
2. Replace the use of the BSDS method of access. This can be done be using explicit archive data set ddnames
and/or active log data set ddnames in the JCL used to invoke the user-written application program.

00D10015
Explanation: The DB2 stand-alone log services OPEN processing macro (DSNJSLR) issued this reason code. The
VSAM OPEN of the bootstrap data set was successful but the record format of the BSDS is invalid. An invalid BSDS
is the result of a failure during a prior attempt to run conversion program DSNJCNVB.
System action: In response to DSNJSLR FUNC=OPEN call, DB2 places a return code of 12 in register 15 and a
reason code of 00D10015 in register 0. No abend is issued by the stand-alone log services CSECT (DSNJRS01), and no
information is written to SYS1.LOGREC data set.
The stand-alone log services program is under the control of a user-written program that uses the DSNJSLR macro.
The user program must, therefore, anticipate and react to a nonzero return code and a nonzero reason code, possibly
by terminating the execution of the user program.
System programmer response: The procedure for running program DSNJCNVB includes making a copy of the
BSDS before conversion. Restore the BSDS to the original pre-conversion copy, and try the conversion again. When
the BSDS data set is successfully converted, rerun the original application program.

00D10016
Explanation: The DB2 stand-alone log services OPEN processing macro (DSNJSLR) issued this reason code. In the
job control language (JCL) associated with the user-written application, MxxARCHV and/or MxxACTn DD
statements were specified for a DB2 member while MxxBSDS was also specified for the same member. However, the
specification of MxxARCHV and MxxACTn DD statements is mutually exclusive with the specification of MxxBSDS
DD statement for the same member.
System action: In response to DSNJSLR FUNC=OPEN call, DB2 places a return code of 12 in register 15 and a
reason code of 00D10016 in register 0. No abend is issued by the stand-alone log services, and no information is
written to SYS1.LOGREC data set.
User response: Correct the JCL and rerun the job. Specify either the DD statements for the log data sets
(MxxARCHV and MxxACTN) or the DD statement for the BSDS (MxxBSDS) for a given member; do not specify
both.

00D10017
Explanation: The DB2 stand-alone log services OPEN processing macro (DSNJSLR) issued this reason code. The job
control language (JCL) associated with the user-written application indicated that the logs from more than one DB2
member were to be read in CI mode. However, CI mode is allowed only when reading the log of a single DB2
system.
System action: In response to DSNJSLR FUNC=OPEN call, DB2 places a return code of 12 in register 15 and a
reason code of 00D10017 in register 0. No abend is issued by the stand-alone log services, and no information is
written to SYS1.LOGREC data set.
User response: Either remove the CI mode from the OPEN request to read log records of more than one member or
change the JCL to specify only one system's log to read its log in CI mode.

Explanation: The DB2 stand-alone log services OPEN processing macro (DSNJSLR) issued this reason code. In the
job control language (JCL) associated with the user-written application, more than one DB2 system's logs were
identified. However, on the OPEN request an RBA range was specified. When reading logs from more than one DB2
system, you cannot specify an RBA range; you must specify an LRSN range.
System action: In response to DSNJSLR FUNC=OPEN call, DB2 places a return code of 12 in register 15 and a
reason code of 00D10018 in register 0. No abend is issued by the stand-alone log services, and no information is
written to SYS1.LOGREC data set.
User response: Correct the range specification on the OPEN request, and rerun the job. If range is specified when
reading log records from multiple members, LRSN=YES must also be specified. Also range must be specified if
GROUP DD or a MxxBSDS (BSDS) DD is specified in the JCL.

Explanation: The DB2 stand-alone log services GET processing macro (DSNJSLR) issued this reason code. A gap in
the log RBA range has been encountered when switching log data sets, indicating missing log records.
This condition may or may not be intentional on the part of the user. Normally, a continuous set of log records are
supplied as input by the ACTIVEn and ARCHIVE ddnames in the user's JCL. If a log data set was intentionally (or
unintentionally) removed, this condition will arise.
System action: In response to the DSNJSLR FUNC=GET call, DB2 places a return code of 4 in register 15 and a
reason code of 00D10021 in register 0. No abend is issued by the stand-alone log services CSECT (DSNJRS01), and no

Information about the results of the GET request is also returned in the stand-alone log GET Feedback Area (SLRF).
A pointer to the next log record following the gap is placed in SLRFFRAD.
The stand-alone log services program is under the control of a user-written program that uses the DSNJSLR macro.
The user program must therefore anticipate and react to a nonzero return code and a nonzero reason code, possibly

System programmer response: The DD statements in the user's Job Control Language (JCL) must specify the log
data sets in ascending log RBA range order. If both ARCHIVE and ACTIVEn DD statements are included, the first
archive data set must contain the lowest log RBA value.
Use the print log map (DSNJU004) utility to obtain a listing of the RBA ranges associated with each archive log data
set and active log data set. If necessary:
v Adjust the concatenation sequence of the archive data sets in the user's JCL to ensure that the log records are read
in ascending RBA sequence.
v Adjust the order of the active log data sets such that the RBA range is arranged in ascending order, starting with
the ACTIVE1 ddname, and progressing through the ACTIVEn ddname.
Following the above adjustments, resubmit the user's JCL.

00D10026
Explanation: The DB2 stand-alone log services GET processing macro (DSNJSLR) issued this reason code. The GET
processing was unable to locate a log data set containing the requested RBA.
There could be several reasons for this error:
v The RBA range supplied in the RANGE parameter may have exceeded the upper or lower bound of RBAs
available on all active log data sets and all archive log data sets. This will normally occur when the user has
specified the bootstrap data set (BSDS) method in the JCL.
v The RBA range supplied in the RANGE parameter may have exceeded the upper or lower bound of RBAs
available on the active log data sets and/or archive log data sets supplied in the user's JCL. This will occur when
the user has supplied log data sets using the ACTIVEn and ARCHIVE ddnames.
System action: In response to the DSNJSLR FUNC=GET call, DB2 places a return code of 8 in register 15 and a
reason code of 00D10026 in register 0. No abend is issued by the stand-alone log services CSECT (DSNJRS01), and no
information is written to SYS1.LOGREC data set.
Information about the results of the GET request is also returned in the stand-alone log GET Feedback Area (SLRF).
The RBA for which the GET request failed is placed in SLRFRBA.
The stand-alone log services program is under the control of a user-written program that uses the DSNJSLR macro.
The user program must therefore anticipate and react to a nonzero return code and a nonzero reason code, possibly
by terminating the execution of the user program.
System programmer response: To resolve the problem, use the print log map (DSNJU004) utility to obtain a listing
of the archive and active log data sets, and their corresponding RBA ranges. Check the user's JCL and the user's
RANGE parameter to ensure that they are in harmony with one another. Correct the JCL and RANGE parameters as
necessary, and rerun the application.

Explanation: The DB2 stand-alone log services OPEN processing macro (DSNJSLR) issued this reason code. Both
LRSN range and CI mode read were specified on the OPEN request when reading the log of a DB2 system. However,
when reading the log in CI mode, range can be specified only in RBA.
System action: In response to DSNJSLR FUNC=OPEN call, DB2 places a return code of 12 in register 15 and a
reason code of 00D10028 in register 0. No abend is issued by the stand-alone log services, and no information is
written to SYS1.LOGREC data set.

00D10029
Explanation: The DB2 stand-alone log services OPEN processing macro (DSNJSLR) issued this reason code. The
BSDS data set of a member named in the BSDS data set pointed to by the GROUP DD statement cannot be allocated.
System action: In response to DSNJSLR FUNC=OPEN call, DB2 places a return code of 12 in register 15 and a
reason code of 00D10029 in register 0. No abend is issued by the stand-alone log services, and no information is
written to SYS1.LOGREC data set.
User response: Make sure the BSDS data set of every member named in the BSDS data set pointed to by the
GROUP DD statement is available for allocation. If the missing BSDS data set belongs to a member that is no longer
active and its BSDS data set does not exist any more, then do not use GROUP DD to allocate required BSDS and log
data sets. To read log records of other active members, specify a MxxBSDS DD statements for each active member.
The print log map (DSNJU004) utility can be used to find the name of every member's BSDS data set.

00D1002B
Explanation: The DB2 stand-alone log services GET processing macro (DSNJSLR) issued this reason code. The GET
processing has requested an RBA in an active log data set which was previously not opened. A VSAM OPEN error
occurred while opening the active log data set. The error was determined to be one which could be corrected;
however, a system error occurred while executing an MVS TESTCB macro to determine whether the active log data
set which had just been opened was a VSAM ESDS data set or a VSAM LDS data set.
System action: In response to the DSNJSLR FUNC=GET call, DB2 places a return code of 12 in register 15 and a
reason code of 00D1002B in register 0. No abend is issued by the stand-alone log services CSECT (DSNJRS01), and no
information is written to SYS1.LOGREC data set.
Information about the results of the GET request is also returned in the stand-alone log GET Feedback Area (SLRF).
The VSAM return code from the original VSAM OPEN error is placed in SLRFRG15. The ACB error code
(ACBERFLG) from the ACB used in the original VSAM OPEN operation is placed in SLRFERCD. The ddname of the
data set on which the activity occurred is placed in SLRFDDNM.
The stand-alone log services program is under the control of a user-written program that uses the DSNJSLR macro.
The user program must therefore anticipate and react to a nonzero return code and a nonzero reason code, possibly

System programmer response: Determine the meaning of the VSAM OPEN error returned in SLRFRG15, and the
ACB error code returned in SLRFERCD. Take appropriate action, and resubmit the application job.
If the SLRFERCD field contains X'1001' (decimal 4097), then the error is the result of an inconsistency between the
TESTCB parmlist generated in DSNJRS03 and the level of MVS under which the application program was executed.

Explanation: The DB2 stand-alone log services GET processing macro (DSNJSLR) issued this reason code. The GET
processing has requested an RBA in an active log data set which was previously not opened. A VSAM OPEN error
occurred while opening the active log data set. The open error was corrected by use of an access method services
VERIFY, but a subsequent attempt to reposition the VSAM pointer back to the beginning of the active log data set
(via access method services POINT) failed.
System action: In response to the DSNJSLR FUNC=GET call, DB2 places a return code of 12 in register 15 and a
reason code of 00D1002D in register 0. No abend is issued by the stand-alone log services CSECT (DSNJRS01), and
no information is written to SYS1.LOGREC data set.
Information about the results of the GET request is also returned in the stand-alone log GET Feedback Area (SLRF).
The VSAM return code from the original VSAM OPEN error is placed in SLRFRG15. The ACB error code

00D10030
Explanation: The DB2 stand-alone log services GET and CLOSE processing macro (DSNJSLR) issued this reason
code. The stand-alone log services uses a request block to establish communication between itself and the invoking
application program. The address to the request block is returned to the application program on a FUNC=OPEN call,
and is required for all subsequent stand-alone FUNC=GET and FUNC=CLOSE calls in the RBR parameter. This
reason code is returned to the invoking application when the RBR does not address a valid stand-alone request block.
Subsequently, the application program's request cannot be processed.
System action: In response to the DSNJSLR FUNC=GET or FUNC=CLOSE call, DB2 places a return code of 8 in
register 15 and a reason code of 00D10030 in register 0. No abend is issued by the stand-alone log services CSECT
(DSNJRS01), and no information is written to SYS1.LOGREC data set.
The stand-alone log services program is under the control of a user-written program that uses the DSNJSLR macro.
The user program must therefore anticipate and react to a nonzero return code and a nonzero reason code, possibly
by terminating the execution of the user program.
System programmer response: On a FUNC=OPEN call, the RBR value is returned in register 1. The application
program must preserve this value for all subsequent stand-alone FUNC=GET and FUNC=CLOSE calls. Due to an
application program logic error in the program which invokes the stand-alone log services, the RBR value has been
compromised. Repair the application program, and resubmit the application job.

00D10031
Explanation: The DB2 stand-alone log services GET processing macro (DSNJSLR) issued this reason code. The GET
processing has requested an RBA in a log data set which was previously not opened. The user's Job Control
Language (JCL) has specified that the bootstrap data set (BSDS) be used as the guide to determining which log data
sets are required. An attempt to dynamically allocate the appropriate log data set (via MVS SVC 99) failed.
System action: In response to the DSNJSLR FUNC=GET call, DB2 places a return code of 12 in register 15 and a
reason code of 00D10031 in register 0. No abend is issued by the stand-alone log services CSECT (DSNJRS01), and no
information is written to SYS1.LOGREC data set.
Information about the results of the GET request is also returned in the stand-alone log GET Feedback Area (SLRF).

00D10040
Explanation: The DB2 stand-alone log services GET processing macro (DSNJSLR) issued this reason code. The GET
processing has requested an RBA in an archive log data set which was previously not opened. An attempt is made to
open the second file on the archive log tape (the first file normally contains the bootstrap data set, while the second
is normally the archive log data set). If this first attempt failed because the archive log data set was not the second
file on an archive tape, then the RDJFCB macro is used to change the data set sequence number from the default
value of 2 to a value of 1, before the OPEN is attempted again. This reason code is generated when an error was
returned from the RDJFCB macro.
System action: In response to the DSNJSLR FUNC=GET call, DB2 places a return code of 12 in register 15 and a
reason code of 00D10040 in register 0. No abend is issued by the stand-alone log services CSECT (DSNJRS01), and no
information is written to SYS1.LOGREC data set.
Information about the results of the GET request is also returned in the stand-alone log GET Feedback Area (SLRF).

Explanation: The DB2 stand-alone log services GET processing macro (DSNJSLR) issued this reason code. The
bootstrap data set (BSDS) was erroneously specified as one of the ARCHIVE data sets in the user's Job Control
Language (JCL). Consequently, the GET request failed.
System action: In response to the DSNJSLR FUNC=GET call, DB2 places a return code of 8 in register 15 and a
reason code of 00D10050 in register 0. No abend is issued by the stand-alone log services CSECT (DSNJRS01), and no

00D10061
Explanation: The DB2 stand-alone log services GET processing macro (DSNJSLR) issued this reason code. The log
record control interval (CI) requested by the application program was read successfully from an active log data set or
an archive log data set. However, the physical record length returned from reading the CI is not the expected length.
The GET function will complete, but will issue this reason code as a warning.
The length of a log CI in an active log data set is expected to be 4089 bytes. The length of a log CI in an archive log
data set is expected to be 4096 bytes.
System action: In response to the DSNJSLR FUNC=GET call, DB2 places a return code of 4 in register 15 and a
reason code of 00D10061 in register 0. No abend is issued by the stand-alone log services CSECT (DSNJRS01), and no
information is written to SYS1.LOGREC data set. The GET function will complete, but will issue this reason code as a
warning.
Information about the results of the GET request is also returned in the stand-alone log GET Feedback Area (SLRF).
The length and address of the CI are placed in fields SLRFRCLL and SLRFFRAD, respectively. The RBA associated
with the CI is placed in SLRFRBA. The 'ddname' of the data set on which the activity occurred is placed in
SLRFDDNM.
The stand-alone log services program is under the control of a user-written program that uses the DSNJSLR macro.
The user program must therefore anticipate and react to a nonzero return code and a nonzero reason code, possibly
by terminating the execution of the user program.
System programmer response: The RDF/CIDF control information in the CI has been compromised. If the
SLRFRCLL field indicates a value greater than expected, then the data within the CI can still be used by the
application program. If the SLRFRCLL field indicates a value less than expected, then the data within the CI in all
likelihood can still be used, but with caution (additional error checking routines may be required by the user
program).

System programmer response: Several possibilities exist for the cause of this condition:
v The Recovery Log Manager component of DB2 did not originally construct the LRH properly.
v The log record header (LRH) for the log record segment was damaged after it was written by the DB2 subsystem.
v The application program continued to process after receipt of a 00D10021 reason code (gap in the log).
If the error was caused by the application program, modifications to the application program may be required.
If the error is a suspected DB2 problem, run the log print (DSN1LOGP) utility, specifying a range of RBAs which
would encompass the problem RBA. Determine if the LRH of the log record segment is truly in error by looking at
the record segments directly preceding and after the record segment in question.

Explanation: A request to disable data sharing failed.
System action: DB2 startup terminates.
Operator response: Collect an SVC memory dump, and contact the system programmer.
System programmer response: Obtain the SVC memory dump for the return code. To disable data sharing, you
must run the disable data sharing job (DSNTIJGF) and then restart DB2.
Problem determination: General register 2 contains a return code. Explanation of the return code is as follows:
2 A request to disable data sharing is in the BSDS, but a conditional restart record is not present. You must
use job DSNTIJGF for the correct conditional restart control record.
4 A request to disable data sharing is recorded in the BSDS, but the conditional restart record is not correct.
You cannot request a normal conditional restart with a disable request. You must use job DSNTIJGF.
8 Update of the BSDS failed. Data sharing was not disabled. See DB2 code 00D10411 for problem
determination. After the BSDS problem is fixed, run DSNTIJGF to disable data sharing, and then restart
DB2.
10 A delete in the BSDS failed. Data sharing was not disabled. See DB2 code 00D10413 for problem
determination. After the BSDS problem is fixed, run DSNTIJGF to disable data sharing, and then restart
DB2.

Explanation: Recursive abends were detected while trying to reinitialize an archive log read service task.
System action: An execution unit writes a record to SYS1.LOGREC and requests an SVC dump. The DB2 subsystem
then terminates to avoid leaving an execution unit in a state of indefinite suspension.
Operator response: Collect the SYS1.LOGREC, SVC dump, and console output. Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Obtain the SYS1.LOGREC, the SVC dump, and a listing of the BSDS by running the
print log map (DSNJU004) utility. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: RLM standard diagnostic information is provided in Chapter 9, ¡°X'D1......' codes,¡± on page 485.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v Contents of the BSDS (both copies if dual BSDS in use) obtained by using the DB2 print log map (DSNJU004)
utility.
v SYSPRINT output, including JCL, for the application program or batch job, and system messages that were issued.
Make sure that MSGLEVEL=(1,1) on the JOB statement so that all diagnostic information is sent to SYSPRINT.
00D10261
Explanation: While scanning the records and record segments in a log control interval (CI), it was discovered that
the forward record chain was broken. This condition is the result of an incorrect record length in the log record
header of some record in the log CI.
System action: This reason code can be issued by an active DB2 subsystem as the log buffers are scanned before
they are written to the active log, or by the DB2 stand-alone log services GET processing macro (DSNJSLR) as a CI is
retrieved from a user-specified active or archive log data set.
If the reason code is issued by an active DB2 subsystem, then an abend is issued. A diagnostic record is written to
SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested.
v If the error was detected by DSNJOFF1, then the archiving of the active log data set is terminated and the faulty
active log data set is marked 'stopped'.
v If the error was detected by DSNJR005, then message DSNJ012I is issued and the calling agent is terminated.
v If the error was detected by DSNJW009, then message DSNJ012I is issued and the DB2 subsystem is terminated.
v If the error was detected by DSNJW107, then the DB2 subsystem is terminated.
If this reason code is issued as the result of DB2 stand-alone log services GET processing, no abend is issued by the
stand-alone log services CSECT (DSNJRS01), and no information is written to SYS1.LOGREC data set. Rather, in
response to the DSNJSLR FUNC=GET call, DB2 places a return code of 4 in register 15 and a reason code of 00D10261 in register 0. Information about the results of the GET request is also returned in the stand-alone log GET feedback area (SLRF). The RBA of the record in error is placed in SLRFRBA. The address and length of the CI which contains the errant log record header are placed in SLRFFRAD and SLRFRCLL, respectively. The ddname of the data set on which the activity occurred is placed in SLRFDDNM.
Operator response: If the reason code is issued by an active DB2 subsystem, collect the SYS1.LOGREC and SVC
dump, and notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If the reason code is issued by an active DB2 subsystem, obtain the SYS1.LOGREC
and the SVC dump from the operator.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v Contents of the BSDS (both copies if dual BSDS in use) obtained by using the DB2 print log map (DSNJU004)
utility.
Problem determination: If the reason code is issued by an active DB2 subsystem, obtain a DSN1LOGP detail report
containing the log record(s) associated with the failure.
If the reason code is issued upon return of an invocation of the DB2 stand-alone log services macro (DSNJSLR), then
an additional user-written exit or diagnostic routine may have to be written.

System action: The DSNL030I message is issued at the server. The database access agent is not allocated.
Operator response: Notify the communications database administrator.
System programmer response: Make sure the USERNAMES column in SYSIBM.LUNAMES has been specified
correctly for the indicated LUNAME. If you intend to use remote authorization IDs that differ from the DB2
authorization IDs, verify that the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table has rows that correctly specify the DB2 authorization
IDs to be used for each possible remote authorization ID.
Problem determination: Analyze the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table for an incorrect or missing entry.
00D3001E
Explanation: The SYSTEM PARAMETER section (DSN6SYSP) in the DB2 installation parameter module does not
exist.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested. DDF is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: This is probably an installation error. Obtain a listing of the DSNZPARM module
used.
Problem determination: Ensure that DSN6SYSP was installed correctly.
00D3001F
Explanation: ACCRDBRM received from the remote server indicates incompatible server.
System action: The TYPDEFNAM or TYPDEFOVR values returned from the remote server in the DDM
ACCRDBRM reply require data type and/or code page translations that cannot be supported by the local DB2. The
local DB2 has disconnected the conversation with the remote server. DB2 requests neither a SVC dump nor a
SYS1.LOGREC record.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference. Notify the system programmer at the remote location that the remote server may not be usable.
User response: Notify the system programmer. Invoke the application after the problem has been corrected.
Problem determination: Determine the server being accessed by examining the SQLCODE -30041 message text.
Refer also to the DDM documentation of the ACCRDB command and the ACCRDBRM reply message.
00D30020
Explanation: The processing of the CONNECT statement at a remote server has failed. This is because acceptable
CONNECT information was not conveyed in the distributed relational database architecture (DRDA) EXCSAT
command sent by the local DB2 to the remote server.
System action: The remote server database access agent (DBAA) sends a DRDA reply message (for example,
MGRLVLRM) to the local DB2 which indicates the specific nature of the problem. The above reason code is sent in
the server diagnosis area of the reply message. The DBAA awaits further DRDA commands from the local DB2.
Operator response: Operator will not detect this problem.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
User response: The SQLCA returned in response to the CONNECT statement indicates what DRDA reply message
was sent by the remote server. The user should contact the local DB2 system administrator with this information.
Problem determination: This represents a DRDA configuration mismatch between the local DB2 and the remote
server. The precise mismatch is determined from the reply message sent from the remote server to the local DB2. The
reply message may be determined by examining the SQLCODE and the SQLCA tokens returned for the CONNECT
statement.
The remote server and local DB2 system administrators should consult together to determine if this is a system
configuration error, or if an internal error exists at either the local DB2 or remote server.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
Collect the following local DB2 diagnostic items:
v Application source code and run time listing.
v Relevant error and system logs spanning the time of the failure.
00D30021
Explanation: The processing of the CONNECT statement at a DB2 remote server has failed. This is because
acceptable CONNECT information was not conveyed in the distributed relational database architecture (DRDA)
ACCRDB command sent by the local DB2 to the remote server.
System action: The remote server database access agent (DBAA) sends a DRDA reply message (for example,
VALNSPRM) to the local DB2 which indicates the specific nature of the problem. The above reason code is sent in
the server diagnosis area of the reply message. The DBAA awaits further DRDA commands from the local DB2.
Operator response: Operator will not detect this problem.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
User response: The SQLCA returned in response to the CONNECT statement indicates what DRDA reply message
was sent by the remote server. The user should contact the local DB2 system administrator with this information.
Problem determination: This represents a DRDA configuration mismatch between the local DB2 and the remote
server. The precise mismatch is determined from the reply message sent from the DB2 remote server to the local DB2.
The reply message may be determined by examining the SQLCODE and the SQLCA tokens returned for the
CONNECT statement. It could indicate any one of the following problems (but is not limited to these):
v The EXCSAT command was not successfully processed prior to receipt of the ACCRDB command.
v The TYPDEFNAM parameter (specifies local DB2 data types) in the ACCRDB command is not supported.
v The TYPDEFOVR parameter (specifies local DB2 CCSIDs) in the ACCRDB command is not supported.
v The local DB2 product is not recognized/supported by the remote server.
The system administrators for the two locations should consult together to determine if this is a system configuration
error or if an internal error exists at either location.
Collect the following diagnostic items at the remote server:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run and a listing of SYSLOG data set for the period of time
spanning the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v The system CCSIDs.
Collect the following diagnostic items at the local DB2:
v Application source code and run time listing.
v Relevant error and system logs spanning the time of the failure.
v The system CCSIDs.
00D30022
Explanation: The processing of the CONNECT statement at the remote server has failed and the local DB2 Data
Base Access Agent (DBAA) has been abended. This is because authorization checking has failed at the remote server.
System action: The conversation with the local DB2 is terminated by the remote server with an LU6.2 SNA sense
code. The DBAA is abended. A DSNL030I message is written to the MVS console at the remote server, and an alert is
generated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Either the user does not have the proper authority to execute at the remote server, or there
is a security configuration mismatch in the communication database between the local DB2 and the remote server.
(For example, a row might be missing in the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table at the remote server.)
Examine the DSNL030I message or the alert for a more specific reason code describing the failure. Consult with the
two system administrators if necessary to fix the problem. No dump is generated for this abend.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.

00D3002D
Explanation: The connection to the remote server failed. The SYSIBM.USERNAMES table did not contain an
outbound row and did not specify the remote authorization ID for the plan owner DB2 authorization ID. When the
USERNAMES column in SYSIBM.LUNAMES or SYSIBM.IPNAMES is specified as 'O' or 'B', outbound name
translation is in use. The SYSIBM.USERNAMES table must contain entries that describe the remote authorization IDs
that are used for each DB2 authorization ID that communicates with the LU or the TCP/IP address.
System action: A response is sent to the application to indicate that the resource is unavailable. The request is not
sent to the remote site.
Operator response: Notify the communications database administrator.
System programmer response: Make sure the USERNAMES column in SYSIBM.LUNAMES or SYSIBM.IPNAMES is
specified correctly for the indicated LUNAME or IPADDR. If you intend to use remote authorization IDs that differ
from the DB2 authorization IDs, verify that the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table has rows that specify the remote
authorization ID to be used for each possible DB2 authorization ID. These rows must specify 'O' in the TYPE column
of the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table.
Problem determination: Analyze the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table for an incorrect or missing entry.

00D3003B
Explanation: A distributed thread was canceled because the timeout value in the DB2 startup parameters module
(usually DSNZPARM) was exceeded. This value is specified by the IDLE THREAD TIMEOUT value in the DSNTIPR
installation panel or the IDTHTOIN value in the DSN6FAC macro, which is used to build the DB2 start up
parameters module.
System action: The execution unit abends.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: The server thread was holding DB2 resources and the requester application did not
make a request to the DB2 server thread for an extended period of time. The server thread is terminated in order to
releases resources that might affect other threads.
This usually occurs for one of these reasons:
v The ACTIVE thread option was specified in the DDF THREADS field of the DSNTIPR installation panel, and a
requester application or its user did not make a request to the DB2 server for an extended period. This can
happen, for example, during a lengthy user absence. As a result, the server thread becomes susceptible to being
canceled because of the timeout value.
Determine why the requester application has not made a request to the DB2 server in the specified time. If the
design or use of the application requires additional time, increase the IDLE THREAD TIMEOUT value or set it to
zero to deactivate the function.
v The INACTIVE thread option was specified in the DDF THREADS field of the DSNTIPR installation panel, and a
requester application or its user:
¨C Failed to commit before an extended dormant period (such as user absence), or
¨C Committed before an extended dormant period (such as user absence), but database resources are still held
because of other existing conditions.
As a result, the server thread cannot be moved to the inactive state and becomes susceptible to being canceled
because of the timeout value.
Determine why the server thread was not moved to the inactive state. If the design or use of the application
requires additional time, increase the IDLE THREAD TIMEOUT value or set it to zero to deactivate the function.

Explanation: A connection or thread that is running under KEEPDYNAMIC refresh rules was actively in use for
more than one hour. A unit-of-work was completed and only packages bound with the KEEPDYNAMIC(YES) option
are causing the thread to remain active with its connection.
This condition might normal if the client connected to DB2 indicating that it uses KEEPDYNAMIC(YES) packages
and it is enabled for either:
v Sysplex workload balancing.
v Seamless failover.
Under the support for KEEPDYNAMIC refresh rules from the following drivers, when a client socket is closed from
the server, the client attempts to reconnect back to the same server and marks that all statements managed under the
connection need to be prepared.
v IBM Data Server Driver for Java
v IBM Data Server Driver for ODBC/CLI/.NET
System action: The connection or thread is terminated.

Explanation: An invalid or incomplete DDF communication record was found in the BSDS.
System programmer response: Use the DSNJU003 change log inventory utility to add a valid DDF communication
record to the BSDS.
00D30041
Explanation: An invalid subsystem IPv4 address was found the BSDS. The specified address does not conform to
dotted decimal form.
System programmer response: Use the DSNJU003 change log inventory utility to correct or remove the BSDS DDF
communication record subsystem IPv4 address. See the IPV4 and NOIPV4 keywords of the DDF statement for more
information.
00D30042
Explanation: An invalid subsystem IPv6 address was found the BSDS. The specified address does not conform to
colon hexadecimal form.

Explanation: An invalid group IPv6 address was found the BSDS. The specified address does not conform to colon
hexadecimal form.
System programmer response: Use the DSNJU003 change log inventory utility to correct or remove the BSDS DDF
communication record group IPv6 address. See the GRPIPV6 and NGRPIPV6 keywords of the DDF statement for
more information.
00D30045
Explanation: An subsystem IPv4 or IPv6 address is invalid with respect to the specified group IPv4 or IPv6 address.
Data sharing members require subsystem or member and group pairs. That is, if a subsystem or member IP address
is specified, a corresponding group address is also required since the DB2 subsystem is a member of a data sharing
group.
System programmer response: Use the DSNJU003 change log inventory utility to add a corresponding group
address or to remove the subsystem or member address. See the GRPIPV4, GRPIPV6, NOIPV4, and NOIPV6
keywords of the DDF statement for more information.
00D30046
Explanation: A value was found for the IPNAME field of the BSDS DDF record but only zero values were found for
the PORT and RESPORT fields in the BSDS DDF record. If an IPNAME value is specified, DDF will only attempt to
activate its TCP/IP communications support which needs values for PORT and RESPORT in the BSDS DDF record.
System programmer response: Use the DSNJU003 change log inventory utility to add non-zero values for the PORT
and RESPORT fields of the BSDS DDF record or to remove the IPNAME value if SNA/APPC communication is
needed.
00D300F1
Explanation: The DSNLTOKS macro was invoked to extract error information from the DTMF block using the
CHECK_SQLCODE keyword and the DTMF block was either uninitialized or contained an SQL return code that was
not negative. This is a DB2 internal error.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC and an SVC dump is requested. The execution unit is
abnormally terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: This is a DB2 internal error. Obtain a copy of SYS1.LOGREC and the SVC dump.
Determine the failing environment (DB2, IMS, CICS, or TSO). If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to
report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting
data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: This name of the module that invoked the function given as the abending module name.
This is not the module in error. An earlier failing module neglected to report error information in the DTMF block.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00D300F2
Explanation: EXCSATRD reply received from a remote server indicates an incompatible server.
System action: The manager levels returned from the local DB2 in the DDM EXCSATRD reply were too low for the
local DB2 to support. The local DB2 has disconnected the conversation with the remote server. DB2 requests neither
an SVC dump nor a SYS1.LOGREC record written.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference. Notify the system programmer at the remote location that the remote server is not usable.
User response: Notify the system programmer. Invoke the application after the problem has been corrected.
Problem determination: Determine the server being accessed by inspecting the SQLCODE -30041 message text.
Refer to the DDM documentation of the EXCSAT command.
00D300F3
Explanation: The connection to the remote server failed. The SYSIBM.USERNAMES table did not contain an
outbound row and did not specify the remote authorization ID for the new user primary DB2 authorization ID.
When the USERNAMES column in SYSIBM.LUNAMES or SYSIBM.IPNAMES is specified as 'O' or 'B', outbound
name translation is in use. The SYSIBM.USERNAMES table must contain entries that describe the remote
authorization IDs that are used for each DB2 authorization ID that communicates with the LU or the TCP/IP
address.
System action: A response is sent to the application to indicate that the resource is unavailable. The request is not
sent to the remote site.
Operator response: Notify the communications database administrator.
System programmer response: Make sure the USERNAMES column in SYSIBM.LUNAMES or SYSIBM.IPNAMES is
specified correctly for the indicated LUNAME or IPADDR. If you intend to use remote authorization IDs that differ
from the DB2 authorization IDs, verify that the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table has rows that specify the remote
authorization ID to be used for each possible DB2 authorization ID. These rows must specify 'O' in the TYPE column
of the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table.
Problem determination: Analyze the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table for an incorrect or missing entry.
00D300F4
Explanation: A DRDA protocol error occurred. Either a reply chain is broken but there is no DDM reply with a high
enough severity to break the chain, or a message chain is unbroken in spite of a high severity code, or a conversation
expected to be available has been terminated. The problem, though detected by DB2, is believed to have originated at
the remote server. The server might not be a DB2 subsystem.
System action: This reason code is returned to the application. A request message has likely been sent to the remote
site but the outcome is uncertain. A DSNL031I message may have been written to the console. Refer to the
description of this message for more information. If this reason code is returned for an SQL 'COMMIT' statement,
determine if manual recovery of the unit of work is necessary.
Operator response: Notify the operator or systems programmer for the remote server.
System programmer response: Determine the product type of the server. The DISPLAY THREAD command may be
used. Refer to the server products' diagnostic recommendations. If the server DBMS is DB2, contact your IBM
representative to report the problem and open an APAR.
Problem determination: The problem originated with the remote server. Follow the diagnostic recommendations
published for the server DBMS product, which might not be DB2.
00D300F5
Explanation: DDM command chaining is in use.
System action: The DTM module returns to its invoker with a return code = 4.
00D300F6
Explanation: A valid but unexpected DDM reply was received from a remote server during a connect, commit, or
abort operation. For a connect, the expected DDM reply is EXCSATRD (for EXCSAT command) or ACCRDBRM (for
ACCRDB command). For a commit or abort, the expected DDM reply is ENDUOWRM. (The DDM command for a
commit is RDBCMM. For a rollback, it is RDBRLLBCK).
System action: The local DB2 tried to access a remote server and the server replied with an unexpected DDM
answer. The remote server may have suffered permanent damage. The local DB2 may or may not subsequently
disconnect the conversation to the server. This is an internal-only DDF reason code. The local DB2 requests neither a
SVC dump nor a SYS1.LOGREC record.
System programmer response: If the SQLCA is available, examine all fields in the SQLCA. Using this information,
try to determine what DDM reply was received. Contact the system programmer at the server site with this
information. This is probably a programming error at the server database system, although it may be a DB2 error.
The server database system may have recorded diagnostic information for the problem. If this is a DB2 error, write
an APAR.
User response: Contact the system programmer
Problem determination: Examine the SQL return code in the SQLCA. It should give further indication of the real
cause.
00D300F7
Explanation: A DDM reply message was too big to fit in the DTM reply buffer.
System action: The requesting allied agent is terminated. A SYS1.LOGREC record is written and an SVC dump is
requested at the local DB2.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: This error should never occur. Write an APAR.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v SVC dump (or system dump), taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, as result of an operator-initiated dump command
or SLIP trap exit.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00D300F8
Explanation: An attempt was made to access data at a remote location that has been started in restricted access
mode. When a DB2 system is started in restricted access mode, no remote inbound or outbound access is allowed.
System action: Remote access is not allowed.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Determine the remote location where the remote data access was attempted. Retry
the request when the remote location and/or the local DB2 has been restarted in full access mode.
00D300F9
Explanation: The DB2 server was unable to allocate a database access agent since the maximum number allowed
was zero (ZPARM MAXDBAT value was zero).
System action: The DB2 server terminates the conversation with a 084B6031 SNA sense code for application-directed
access and a 00D300F9 DB2 code for system-directed access. A DSNL030I message containing this reason code is
written to the MVS operator console at the DB2 server site.
System programmer response: At the server, currently no data base access agents are allowed because the
MAXDBAT value in the ZPARM is zero. If access to this site from a remote site is desirable, change the MAXDBAT
parameter in ZPARM to the maximum number of database access agents needed. Restart DB2 at the server. Notify
the user to rerun the application.
00D300FA
Explanation: You attempted a COMMIT statement for a plan that specified ISOLATION (RR) and update operations
were performed either at the local site or at a remote site. The COMMIT operation could not be performed because
the COMMIT request could not be transmitted to a remote site where Repeatable Read operations had been
performed.
System action: All update operations were backed out.
System programmer response: Determine why the COMMIT failed and retry the application.
00D300FB
Explanation: A resource was not available during database access agent allocation at a remote site.
System action: The allocation of the database access agent was unsuccessful. A 'resource not available' code is
returned to the user. DB2 requests neither a SVC dump nor a SYS1.LOGREC record.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
User response: Notify the system programmer. Invoke the application after the problem has been corrected.
Problem determination: Determine the name of the resource being allocated and correct the problem.
00D300FC
Explanation: You attempted to allocate a resource at a remote site using an invalid name.
System action: The allocation of the database access agent was unsuccessful. A 'resource not available' code is
returned to the user. DB2 requests neither a SVC dump nor a SYS1.LOGREC record. This reason code is returned
only for system-directed access (DSNLTMRA).
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
User response: Notify the system programmer. Invoke the application after the problem has been corrected.
Problem determination: Determine the resource being allocated and correct the problem.
00D300FD
Explanation: An attempt was made to disconnect a connection with a specified location, but the transaction has not
yet been connected to that location. This is a DB2 internal error.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC and an SVC dump is requested. The execution unit is
abnormally terminated.
Problem determination: Obtain a copy of SYS1.LOGREC and the SVC dump. Determine the failing environment
(DB2, IMS, CICS, or TSO). If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
The name of the module that invoked the function incorrectly is given as the abending module name.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00D300FE
Explanation: You executed a COMMIT statement and update operations were performed at a remote site. The
success of the COMMIT operation could not be determined because a failure occurred at the remote site or in the
communication link with the remote site after the request to commit the operation had been transmitted.
System action: The remote updates have been committed or backed out, depending on when the error occurred.
User response: After communication has been reestablished with the remote site, use SQL to query the updated
data to determine whether the updates were committed. If the updates were not committed, rerun the application
and perform the updates again.
00D300FF
Explanation: You attempted a COMMIT statement and update operations were performed at a remote site. The
attempt failed.
System action: The updates at the remote site have been backed out.
User response: Rerun the application.
Problem determination: Determine why the COMMIT failed and retry the application.
00D30100
Explanation: A COMMIT statement was chained to a set of commands sent to an remote server. The remote server
stopped processing the chained commands before it reached the COMMIT. COMMIT was NOT performed.
System action: Any updates performed within the current unit of Work have been backed out.
Operator response: Operator will not detect this problem.
System programmer response: See aProblem Determinationa section below.
User response: Notify the system programmer of the failure.
After the problem causing the chain to be broken at the remote server is fixed, rerun the application and perform the
updates again.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items from the local DB2 system.
v Listing of application program and output from application program.
v Console output and a listing of SYSLOG data set for the period of time spanning the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
Consult with the remote server system programmer to determine the cause of the error.
The remote server system programmer may need to collect the following remote server diagnostic items:
v Relevant error and system logs spanning the time of the failure.
v Any relevant remote server dumps.
00D30101
Explanation: A COMMIT was attempted but failed due to a prior error. Communications to a remote site have been
lost. The COMMIT operation cannot be performed because the COMMIT request could not be transmitted to a
remote site. If the program has performed updates, the updates have been backed out to the prior COMMIT point.
System action: All update operations were backed out.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Restart DDF at the affected sites and rerun the application.
00D30103
Explanation: This reason code may be returned for a failed distributed commit using DRDA protocols. It indicates
that commit has failed because an ABNUOWRM reply message was received from the server for a prior SQL
statement, but an abort had not been driven at the DB2 requester prior to this commit and after the receipt of the
ABNUOWRM.
An ABNUOWRM reply message is sent by the server when it has rolled back its unit-of-work in response to an
unusual situation at the server (for example, deadlock or operator intervention). When an ABNUOWRM reply
message is received by the requester, an abort must be driven at the requester to synchronize the distributed systems.
Until an abort is driven, all subsequent SQL statements will receive an SQLCODE -906. After an abort is driven,
further SQL statements will be accepted.
System action: The commit at the DB2 requester fails.
Operator response: The operator will not detect this problem.
System programmer response: Determine the cause of the problem represented by the SQLCODE returned with the
ABNUOWRM and if necessary, work with the system programmer at the server to resolve it. If you suspect an error
in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see
Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: Scan backwards in your application for the first non -906 SQLCODE prior to the commit. This
SQLCODE was returned with the ABNUOWRM from the server system. Use the server product reference manuals to
determine and correct whatever problem this SQLCODE represents on the server and rerun your application. This
may involve contacting your system programmer if the situation at the Server cannot be corrected or improved by
changes to the application program.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v User's application output, including SQLCAs returned for each SQL statement.

DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference
00D30104
Explanation: The unit-of-work disposition (commit or rollback) received from a DRDA server is inconsistent with
the command sent (commit or rollback), and the SQLCODE returned from the server. For example, if a commit is
sent to the server, and the reply message indicates the unit of work (UOW) was committed, but the SQLCODE
returned is negative, then this reason code will be contained in the alert sent to NetView?.
System action: An alert is generated and sent to NetView. Two trace records, IFCID 0191 and IFCID 0193, may be
written to the Statistics Class 4 trace, and two DSNL031I messages may be written to the console. The trace records
and messages will not be written if this error was previously detected within the last 5 minutes. The Statistics Class 4
trace must be active for the trace records to be written.
An SQLCODE +30100, -30020, or -30030 is returned to the application. An SQLCODE -30020 indicates a rollback was
sent to the DRDA server, but a commit unit-of-work disposition was received. An SQLCODE +30100 or -30030
conveys the unit-of-work disposition reported by the server, and replaces the original SQL return code sent by the
server, which was not consistent with the UOW disposition. The original SQL return code and SQLSTATE returned
by the server are saved as tokens in the SQLCA.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: This is a DRDA distributed protocol problem. Once the nature of the inconsistency is
known, the server system programmer may have to be contacted to help resolve the problem. If you suspect an error
in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see
Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Listing of the user's application program output, including printouts of the SQLCAs received for all SQL
statements.
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of SYSLOG data set for the period of time
spanning the failure.
v Listing of the Statistics Class 4 trace records for the LUWID associated with the failing request.
If no DSNL031I messages were written at the same time as the alert, then scan the log backwards for previous
DSNL031I messages. A DB2 filter function prohibits multiple occurrences of the same problem detected within a 5
minute period from flooding the console and trace data set with diagnostic information. You will have to find an
earlier occurrence of the same problem to start diagnosing it.
Once you have found the two DSNL031I messages, locate the IFCID 0191 and 0193 trace records written for the
problem by using the IFCID sequence numbers from the DSNL031I messages.
The IFCID 0193 trace record will document the nature of the inconsistency (command sent, UOW disposition
received, SQL return code received).
The IFCID 0191 trace record will document the exact data stream returned from the Server. Use this information to
determine if the reply message from the server was correctly converted into the UOW disposition and the SQL return
code reported in the IFCID 0193 record. If the data stream was correctly converted, then the problem lies at the
server and you should contact the system programmer at the server and have him or her analyze the data stream
produced by the server.

00D30105
Explanation: A distributed commit has failed because the allied agent was canceled as a result of a STOP DDF
MODE(FORCE) command during a previous execution of DDF which has terminated. When an allied agent does not
issue database requests for more than 2 minutes after a STOP DDF MODE(FORCE) command is issued, DDF will
come down without terminating the allied agent. The agent is canceled when it makes its next request to DB2.
System action: The commit operation is failed and the agent is canceled. The last unit of work was rolled back at all
server systems when the STOP DDF MODE(FORCE) command was processed.
Operator response: Re-start DDF.
User response: Contact the operator to re-start DDF. After DDF is re-started, continue your application's work
starting with the last unit of work that was rolled back.
00D30106
Explanation: The result of a DRDA distributed commit could not be determined because the reply message from the
server either was invalid or could not be deciphered.
System action: An alert is generated and sent to NetView. An IFCID 0191 trace record may be written to the
statistics class 4 trace, and a DSNL031I message may be written to the console. The trace record and message will not
be written if this error was previously detected within the last 5 minutes. The statistics class 4 trace must be active
for the trace records to be written.
The requester disconnects from the server system. The state of the unit of work at the server is unknown. It may
have been committed, or it may have been rolled back. An SQLCA indicating the nature of the DRDA reply message
distortion is given to the application.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer whenever a DSNL031I message is written to the MVS console.
System programmer response: This is a DRDA distributed protocol problem. Once the nature of the problem is
known, the server system programmer may have to be contacted to help resolve the problem.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: Notify the system programmer. After the problem has been resolved, re-connect to the server site to
determine whether the last unit of work was committed or rolled back. Continue your application after correcting the
server database (if necessary).
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Listing of the user's application program output, including printouts of the SQLCAs received for all SQL
statements.
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of SYSLOG data set for the period of time
spanning the failure.
v Listing of the statistics class 4 trace records.
If no DSNL031I message was written at the same time as the alert, then scan the log backwards for a previous
DSNL031I message. A DB2 filter function prohibits multiple occurrences of the same problem detected within a 5
minute period from flooding the console and trace data set with diagnostic information. You will have to find an
earlier occurrence of the same problem to start diagnosing it.
Once you have found the DSNL031I message, locate the IFCID 0191 trace record written for the problem by using the
IFCID sequence number from the DSNL031I message.
The IFCID 0191 trace record will document the exact data stream returned from the server. Use this information to
determine if the reply message from the Server was correct, and if so, the error resides with the DB2 AR.
If the data stream is incorrect, then the problem lies at the server and you should contact the system programmer at
the server and have he or she analyze the data stream produced by the server.
00D30109
Explanation: Phase 1 of a distributed commit failed. One or more remote servers did one of the following actions:
v Voted NO
v Voted heuristic mixed
v Experienced a communications error
v Made an error in their use of commit protocol
System action: The commit fails. The unit of work is backed out.
For communication errors, message DSNL406I is written to the system console, alert A006 is generated, and trace
record IFCID 0209 is produced to record the server affected (LUWID of the unit of work, and other information).
For protocol errors, message DSNL413I is written to the system console, alert A005 is generated, and trace record
IFCID 0208 is produced to describe the nature of each server's protocol violation.
System programmer response: For protocol errors, contact the system programmer for the remote site. The invalid
sync point message is recorded in the IFCID 0208 trace record. The system logic error that causes the invalid sync
point message must be corrected at the remote site.
User response: Contact the DB2 systems programmer. If the commit failed for other than a commit protocol
violation by a remote server, resubmit your application. Otherwise, wait for resolution of the protocol error.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00D3010A
Explanation: This might occur when a version of IMS that does not support the COMMIT VERIFY exit is running
an IMS MODE=MULTI application with one or more non-DB2 servers. This is probably a user error, since this
scenario is not supported by DB2 and IMS unless the IMS version is 4 or later.
IMS requested a new user SIGNON without an immediately preceding commit or abort, and your application was
connected to one or more remote non-DB2 servers. In order to preserve the consistency of database updates made at
several different servers, when at least one server is a non-DB2 server, a commit or abort must precede any new user
SIGNON.
System action: The execution unit writes a record to SYS1.LOGREC. No dump is requested. The IMS application
terminates as a result of the abend.
Operator response: Collect the SYS1.LOGREC. Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Determine if the IMS version and release being used invokes the DB2 COMMIT
VERIFY exit, which is available in DB2 Version 3 and later. Obtain the SYS1.LOGREC.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00D3010B
Explanation: Cached information was used to determine whether updates are allowed at the server. From the time
of the execution of the CONNECT statement to the time that the first SQL statement was sent to the server, the
conversation SYNC_LEVEL supported by the partner changed from a cached value of SYNC to the current of value
NONE.
SYNC_LEVEL NONE servers are not allowed to update in the current unit of work. Since an update might have
been performed by the partner during execution of the first statement at the server, the application must roll back
(abort).
This reason code is returned as a token in the SQLCODE -904.
System action: The connection to the server is deallocated. The server's portion of the current unit of work is rolled
back at the server. The application is placed in a must-abort state. All subsequent operations except rollback or abort
fail with an SQLCODE -918. The remainder of the current unit of work is backed out when rollback or abort is
performed or when the application terminates.
User response: If your application does not do any work at a server for a long time after issuing a CONNECT,
consider rewriting it to perform the CONNECT immediately before performing any work at the server. This
minimizes the possibility of the server system going down and coming back up at a different SYNC_LEVEL.
Rerun your application starting with the unit of work containing the SQL statement that received an SQLCODE -904.
00D3010C
Explanation: Cached information was used to determine whether updates are allowed at the server. From the time
of the execution of the CONNECT statement to the time that the first SQL statement was sent to the server, the
partner was started with a program that does not support two-phase commit.
Such servers are not allowed to update in the current unit of work. Since an update might have been performed by
the partner during execution of the first statement at the server, the application must roll back.
This reason code is returned as a token in the SQLCODE -904.
System action: The connection to the server is deallocated. The server's portion of the current unit of work is rolled
back at the server. The application is placed in a must-abort state. All subsequent operations except rollback or abort
fail with an SQLCODE -918. The remainder of the current unit of work is backed out when rollback or abort is
performed or when the application terminates.
User response: If your application does not do any work at a server for a long time after issuing a CONNECT,
consider rewriting it to perform the CONNECT immediately before performing any work at the server. This
minimizes the possibility of the server system going down and coming back up at a different level.
Rerun your application starting with the unit of work containing the SQL statement that received the SQLCODE -904.
00D3010D
Explanation: DB2 requested updates at multiple servers, but at least one server does not support distributed
two-phase commit.
System action: If the application is using TSO or BATCH attach, then DB2 rolls back the UOW. If the application is
using CICS or IMS attach, then CICS or IMS rolls back the UOW after receiving the NO commit vote from DB2.
User response: Change the application so that updates to multiple servers (including the local server) are not
performed within a single UOW unless all the update servers in the UOW support distributed two-phase commit.
Problem determination: In the UOW that was not committed, the first SQL statement that performed an update
that was not allowed received an SQLCODE -919. All subsequent SQL statements also received an SQLCODE -919
until a ROLLBACK or a static ROLLBACK SQL statement was executed (if either occurred).
00D3010E
Explanation: The DRDA server system does not support the authentication mechanism specified in the
communications database. For example, the communications database specified that RACF passtickets were supposed
to be used, but the server does not support it.
System action: The attempt to access the remote server fails. An SQLCODE -30073 is returned to the application.
System programmer response: Modify the row in SYSIBM.LUNAMES or SYSIBM.IPNAMES to specify a security
mechanism in the SECURITY_OUT column that the remote server supports.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
00D3010F
Explanation: DB2 was unable to authenticate the DRDA user, due to an error detected by RACF or DCE.
System action: The user's attempt to connect is rejected. An SQLCODE -30082 is returned to the application.
System programmer response: Correct the error detected by DCE or RACF. Both products write messages to the
MVS console describing the error.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
00D30110
Explanation: A DRDA error occurred. The DB2 crypto security component detected an error and could not process
the encryption security tokens used to authenticate the user.
System action: The attempt to connect to DB2 fails, the failure is reported to the SQL application with an SQLCODE
of -30082, and the connection is terminated.
System programmer response: Determine the reason for the failure by verifying the DRDA data stream and by
reviewing the server diagnostic work area returned in the DRDA security check reply message.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
00D30111
Explanation: DB2 SAF Identity Mapping service encountered an error when a request was made to process a user
registry name.
System action: The DB2 SAF Identity Mapping service request is not processed. Normal connection authentication
continues.
System programmer response: Verify that the z/OS system is running at z/OS Version 1.8 or higher.
00D30112
Explanation: Integrated Cryptographic Service Facility (ICSF) detected an error and could not process the DRDA
request.
System action: A DSNL045I or DSNL046I message might have been written to the console. Refer to the description
of the message for more information.
If ICSF fails during connection processing at the DB2 requester, the connection attempt fails, and the failure is
reported to the application with SQLCODE -904. The connection is terminated.

00D30115
Explanation: Authentication of a remote user was rejected by DB2. The TCPALVER (TCP/IP Already Verified)
subsystem parameter has been changed, and the security mechanism that was provided is no longer allowed.
Possible causes for this error include:
v A user ID only (no password required) security mechanism is not allowed because the TCPALVER value has been
changed to a value that requires a password.
v A user ID and password security mechanism is not allowed because the TCPALVER value has been changed to a
value that requires security credentials to be properly encrypted.
v A change of password security mechanism is not allowed because the TCPALVER value has been changed to a
value that requires security credentials to be properly encrypted.
v DES-based encrypted security mechanisms are not allowed because the TCPALVER value has been changed to a
value that requires a more secure form of encryption.
The security mechanism will remain restricted unless the DB2 TCP/IP already verified rules are modified to
accommodate the security mechanism.
System action: The remote attempt to access DB2 is rejected, and the connection is terminated.
System programmer response: Change the TCPALVER subsystem parameter to a value that supports the security
mechanism, and try the remote request again. Or, modify the security mechanism to meet the security requirement
that is defined by the TCPALVER subsystem parameter setting, and try the remote request again.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information

00D3101C
Explanation: DB2 has detected an error while processing a connection request from DDCS. A DB2RA connection
request was received from DDCS.
System action: A DDM reply message (SYNTAXRM) is returned to the DRDA client.
Operator response: Notify the DDCS system administrator.
System programmer response: This is probably not a DB2 problem. This error is most likely caused by an incorrect
entry in the DCS directory on DDCS. Refer to IBM Distributed Database Connection Services Installation and
Configuration Guide for information on configuring your DDCS system.
00D31020
Explanation: An attempt was made to use SNA/APPC communications to create an outbound DRDA protocol
connection. However, this DDF, as identified by the corresponding resource-type of 00001000 and its DB2 subsystem
ID as the corresponding resource-name, was started with an IPNAME value. This process caused DDF to only start its
TCP/IP communications support.
System action: Notification of the failure is returned to the application. The conversation is not allocated.
System programmer response: An outbound DRDA protocol connection request was determined to require SNA/
APPC communications. This will occur when only a row in the SYSIBM.LUNAMES table of the DB2
Communications Database table has a LUNAME column value that matches to the LINKNAME column of the row
in the SYSIBM.LOCATIONS table that corresponds to the location requested by the application. If DDF was intended
to be started with only its TCP/IP communications support, then a row must exist in the SYSIBM.IPNAMES table
with a LINKNAME column value for each row in the SYSIBM.LOCATIONS table that has a distinct value for its
LINKNAME column. Otherwise, remove the IPNAME value from the BSDS DDF record by performing an update to
the BSDS DDF record using the NOIPNAME parameter of the DDF statement of DSNJU003, the Change Log
Inventory utility.
00D31022
Explanation: The requested VTAM function for allocating a conversation was not performed because the data
manager returned an unavailable resource when attempting to read the SYSIBM.LOCATIONS table in the
communication database (CDB). The LOCATION cannot be resolved to the remote DB2 subsystem LUNAME.
System action: Notification of the failure is returned to the application. The conversation is not allocated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: For more information, refer to the explanation of message DSNL700I. Collect the following
diagnostic items:
v Definitions of the communication database (CDB) table space, tables, and indexes involved in the error.
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00D31023
Explanation: A request for a protected SNA conversation was rejected by a DB2 server because the SNA exchange
log names (XLN) process has not yet completed with the requesting system.
System action: Message DSNL030I is displayed on the system console with reason code 00D31023. The SNA
conversation is rejected with SNA sense code 08640001, indicating the SNA protocol for protected conversations was
violated.
System programmer response: The requesting system should have sent a valid SNA XLN request before starting a
protected conversation. Contact the system programmer for the requesting system to determine why the SNA XLN
process was not completed successfully.
User response: Notify the DB2 system programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00D31024
Explanation: The requested VTAM function for allocating a conversation was not performed because the location
name is not defined in the SYSIBM.LOCATIONS table in the communication database (CDB).
System action: Notification of the failure is returned to the application. The conversation is not allocated to the
specified location.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Add the location to the SYSIBM.LOCATIONS table.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Location used in the alias entry in SYSIBM.SYSTABLES.
v Contents of the SYSIBM.LOCATIONS table.
00D31025
Explanation: The requested VTAM function for allocating a conversation was not performed because a mode name
could not be found in the SYSIBM.MODESELECT table in the communication database (CDB) for the requesting
thread.
System action: Notification of the failure is returned to the application. The conversation is not allocated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Add the mode name to be selected in the SYSIBM.MODESELECT table for the
authorization ID, PLANNAME, and LUNAME of the service request that failed.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v AUTHORIZATION ID, PLANNAME, and LUNAME of the thread that is used to select the MODENAME in the
SYSIBM.MODESELECT table.
v Contents of SYSIBM.LOCATIONS and SYSIBM.MODESELECT tables.
00D31026
Explanation: The requested VTAM function was not performed because VTAM returned a nonzero return code
while attempting to communicate on a conversation.
System action: Notification of the failure is returned to the application. The conversation is abnormally deallocated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: For more information, refer to the explanation of message DSNL500I or message
DSNL502I, depending on the type of conversation that failed.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00D31027
Explanation: The requested VTAM function cannot be performed because VTAM is abending or because the
operator has issued a HALT NET command to terminate VTAM.
System action: Notification of DDF termination is reported to the application. No remote communications are
allowed. The distributed data facility is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Determine why VTAM was terminated.
00D31029
Explanation: The requested VTAM function to allocate a conversation failed. VTAM returned a nonzero return code
while attempting to negotiate limits with a remote location for a mode.
System action: Notification of the failure is returned to the application. All communications to the remote location
on the mode fail until the CNOS is successfully negotiated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: For more information, refer to the explanation of message DSNL501I.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00D3102A
Explanation: A conversation was not allocated because a VTAM LU name contained in the LUNAME column of the
SYSIBM.LULIST table was also present in the LUNAME column of the SYSIBM.LUNAMES table. A given VTAM LU
name can appear in only one of these two tables.
System action: The conversation is not allocated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Make sure each remote VTAM LU is defined in the SYSIBM.LULIST table or the
SYSIBM.LUNAMES table, but not in both tables.
Verify that the condition did not occur because of the unintended use of a generic LU name, which would make DB2
aware of a partner LU name (its generic LU name) that is not specified in the LUNAME column of the
SYSIBM.LULIST or SYSIBM.LUNAMES tables. Look for evidence of a DSNL510I or DSNL030I message that indicates
the partner's generic LU name instead of its actual LU name. If the use of a generic LU name is indicated, use the
RESET GENERICLU command to purge this generic LU affinity.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Print the contents of the SYSIBM.LUNAMES table.
v Print the contents of the SYSIBM.LULIST table.
Related reference:
-RESET GENERICLU (DB2) (DB2 Commands)

00D3102B
Explanation: A conversation was not allocated because the partner LU attempted to allocate a conversation using a
blank mode name. Although DB2 tolerates CNOS requests with a blank mode name, DB2 does not accept
conversations with a blank mode name.
System action: Message DSNL030I is displayed on the system console with reason code 00D3102B. The conversation
is not allocated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Correct the definitions at the partner LU to prevent conversations from being
allocated with a blank mode name.
00D3102D
Explanation: The requested trusted connection was not established because the SECURITY_ OUT option in the
SYSIBM.IPNAMES table in the communications database (CDB) is not defined correctly. If the TRUSTED column in
SYSIBM. LOCATIONS table is set to 'Y', then the SECURITY_OUT column in the SYSIBM. IPNAMES table must be
set to 'P', 'R', or 'E'.
System action: Notification of the failure is returned to the application. The requested trusted connection is not
established.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Set up the SYSIBM.IPNAMES table correctly.
00D3102E
Explanation: The remote server was not successfully connected. The SYSIBM.USERNAMES table did not contain a
row for trusted context system authorization ID translation, the TYPE column specified as 'S' describing the system
authorization ID. When the USERNAMES column in SYSIBM.IPNAMES specifies 'S' requiring system authorization
ID translation, the SYSIBM.USERNAMES must contain an entry describing the system authorization ID used for
establishing trusted connection.
System action: A resource unavailable is returned to the application. The request is not sent to the remote site.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Make sure the USERNAMES column in SYSIBM.USERNAMES has been specified
correctly for the indicated LINKNAME for trusted connection.
Problem determination: Analyze the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table for an incorrect or missing entry.
00D31030
Explanation: A remote connection cannot be established. This problem might be caused by one of the following
symptoms:
v The LINKNAME column in the SYSIBM.LOCATIONS table in the communications database (CDB) is greater than
8 bytes.
v The LUNAME column in the SYSIBM.LULIST table in the communications database is greater than 8 bytes.
v The MODENAME column in the SYSIBM.MODESELECT or SYSIBM.LUMODES table in the communications
database is greater than 8 bytes.
v The TPN column in the SYSIBM.LOCATIONS table in the communications database is greater than 64 bytes.
v The PORT column in the SYSIBM.LOCATIONS table in the communications database is greater than 32 bytes or
contains leading blanks.
v The DB2 authorization ID used for outbound authorization ID translation is greater than 8 bytes.
v The SYSMODENAME column in the SYSIBM.LUNAMES table in the communications database is greater than 8
bytes.
System action: Notification of the failure is returned to the application. The remote connection is unsuccessful.
System programmer response: Correct the column in error as indicated by the unavailable resource message.
For DB2 authorization ID translation failure, make sure that the remote BIND OWNER option contains an
authorization ID less than or equal to 8 bytes for normal connection.
Problem determination: Collect a listing of the SQL that was used to configure the CDB table in the error.

00D31031
Explanation: The local distributed data facility (DDF) is terminating.
System action: Notification of the failure is returned to the application. DB2 does not allow any new distributed
threads while DDF is in termination or is terminated.
Operator response: Contact the system to determine the cause of DDF termination.
System programmer response: To determine why DDF was terminated and then start DDF.
User response: Contact your system programmer to determine why DDF was terminated.
00D31032
Explanation: The requested VTAM function failed because the distributed data facility (DDF) at the remote location
is terminating.
System action: DB2 writes a SYS1.LOGREC record. No communication on the conversation is allowed.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: To determine the cause of the DDF termination, contact the communication
administrator at the location.
00D31033
Explanation: The VTAM function request to allocate a conversation failed because the thread timed-out while
waiting for a session.
System action: Notification of the failure is returned to the application.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: The defined session limit for the mode used by the thread might be too small. The
CONVLIMIT specified for the mode might have to be negotiated with the communication administrator at the
remote subsystem.
Problem determination: Refer to message DSNL510I for the limit negotiated by VTAMCollect the following
diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v Listing of the contents of SYSIBM.LUMODES in the communications database.
00D31034
Explanation: The MAX REMOTE CONNECTED limit was reached and the conversation was abnormally
deallocated. The thread was not allowed to connect to DB2.
System action: The requester is not connected to DB2.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: The maximum number of database access threads that can concurrently exist is
defined by the installation option MAX REMOTE CONNECTED. When the MAX REMOTE CONNECTED limit is
equal to the number of active database access threads plus the number of inactive database access threads, additional
threads are not allowed to connect to DB2. Use the DDF global statistics to determine if the limit should be increased.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v DDF global statistics to determine the number of requests that failed because of the MAX REMOTE CONNECTED
limit.
00D31035
Explanation: The requested distributed function failed. The database access agent was aborted at the remote
location. Notification of the failure is returned to the requester system application however the failure is really due to
an unexpected failure at the remote server system. This error is an internal error at the remote server system.
Evidence of the failure should be visible as an abend in the remote server system's SYS1.LOGREC information, or,
you might find the failure recorded in a dump.
System action: DB2 writes a SYS1.LOGREC record and requests an SVC dump at the remote DB2 site. DB2 server
system recovery returns this reason code back to the requester system.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Obtain copies of the SYS1.LOGREC and SYSLOG data sets or similar data from each
connected site, the SVC dump at the site of the DB2 failure, and any related dumps from each connected site. If you
suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the
problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference. A dump should be present at
the server system, or evidence of an abend should be visible in SYS1.LOGREC information around the time that this
reason code was returned back to the requester system application. The internal error that caused the server system
abend must be corrected.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output and the listing of the SYSLOG data set from each connected site for the period of time spanning
the failure.
v Listings of the SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1 at each connected site.
00D31036
Explanation: The LINKNAME column of the SYSIBM.LOCATIONS table was invalid. Since LINKNAME is a foreign
key of the SYSIBM.LUNAMES table, the LINKNAME column must specify one of the values provided in the
LUNAME column of the SYSIBM.LUNAMES table. This error should not occur.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC and an SVC dump is requested at the site of the DB2 abend.
Operator response: Collect the SYS1.LOGREC, and the SVC dump.
System programmer response: Obtain copies of the SYS1.LOGREC and SYSLOG data sets from the DB2 site with
the inconsistently defined communications database (CDB).
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output and the listing of the SYSLOG data set from each connected site for the period of time spanning
the failure.
v Listings of the SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1 at each connected site.
00D31037
Explanation: The connection to the remote server failed. The SYSIBM.USERNAMES table did not contain an
outbound row and did not specify the remote authorization ID for the primary DB2 authorization ID. When the
USERNAMES column in SYSIBM.LUNAMES or SYSIBM.IPNAMES is specified as 'O' or 'B', outbound name
translation is in use. The SYSIBM.USERNAMES table must contain entries that describe the remote authorization IDs
that are used for each DB2 authorization ID that communicates with the LU or the TCP/IP address.
System action: A response is sent to the application to indicate that the resource is unavailable. The request is not
sent to the remote site.
Operator response: Notify the communications database administrator.
System programmer response: Make sure the USERNAMES column in SYSIBM.LUNAMES or SYSIBM.IPNAMES is
specified correctly for the indicated LUNAME or IPADDR. If you intend to use remote authorization IDs that differ
from the DB2 authorization IDs, verify that the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table has rows that specify the remote
authorization ID to be used for each possible DB2 authorization ID. These rows must specify 'O' in the TYPE column
of the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table.
Problem determination: Analyze the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table for an incorrect or missing entry.
00D31038
Explanation: A conversation was not allocated for one of these reasons:
v The requesting LU is part of a DB2 sysplex. When one or more LU names within a DB2 sysplex appear in the
SYSIBM.LULIST table at the remote site, all LU names within the sysplex must be identified in the
SYSIBM.LULIST table at the remote site.
¨C You might have intended to list all the sysplex's LU names in the SYSIBM.LULIST table, but you did not
include one or more LU names.
¨C You listed a subset of the LU names in SYSIBM.LULIST but none of the LU names you listed are currently
available. Please note that it can take up to 3 minutes for LU availability information to be updated following
START DDF at the remote site.
¨C The location name sent to a remote site does not match the location name recorded in the BSDS at that remote
site.
¨C The local SYSIBM.LULIST table is incorrectly defined for the remote location.
A DSNL030I message might have been written to the console.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC and the conversation is not allocated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: The CDB tables and DB2 BSDS parameters must correctly associate the LOCATION
names with their corresponding LUNAME names.
The cause of this error is usually one of the following problems:
v The BSDS at the remote site does not have the correct LOCATION or LUNAME value, which causes the remote
DBMS to respond to the wrong LOCATION name when receiving distributed database requests.
v The SYSIBM.LOCATIONS table at the local DB2 system has an incorrect value in the LINKNAME or LOCATION
column for the failing LOCATION, which causes the request to be sent to the wrong remote DBMS.
v The SYSIBM.LULIST table at the local DB2 system has an incorrect value in the LUNAME column for the failing
LOCATION, which causes the request to be sent to the wrong remote DBMS.
v Not all LU names in the requesting DB2 sysplex are defined in the SYSIBM.LULIST table at the remote site.
v Not all LU names in the requesting DB2 sysplex are defined in the SYSIBM.LULIST table at the server DB2
subsystem. The remote LU is not allowed access to the server subsystem.
In general, when the requester is a member of a sysplex, each member of the requesting sysplex should be defined
in SYSIBM.LULIST of the server subsystem. However, there may be causes where an LU of a remote sysplex is not
defined in SYSIBM.LULIST of the local subsystem to prevent the remote LU from being a candidate member when
accessing the remote sysplex. This is known as "member specific routing". If the remote sysplex LU attempts to
access the local subsystem, this reason code will be returned if the remote LU is not defined in the local
SYSIBM.LULIST table and is also not defined in SYSIBM.LUNAMES. Remote requesting sysplex members can be
defined in SYSIBM.LULIST, or, when member specific routing requirements to the remote sysplex member are
needed, the remote sysplex LU can be defined in SYSIBM.LUNAMES for inbound purposes from the remote
sysplex LU that contain the appropriate inbound security characteristics.
v The local DB2 system contains a SYSIBM.LULIST row for a remote system that is not a member of a Data Sharing
group. SYSIBM.LULIST rows CANNOT be defined for remote non Data Sharing server systems. Remove the
SYSIBM.LULIST row for the remote systems.
Problem determination:
v Determine the LUNAME and LOCATION name of the DB2 system that attempted to start a VTAM conversation.
v Print the contents of the SYSIBM.LOCATIONS table at that site.
v Print the contents of the SYSIBM.LULIST table at both the local site and the remote site.
v Determine the LUNAME and LOCATION name of the remote DBMS involved in the failure from the BSDS at the
remote site.
v Issue the -DISPLAY LOCATION command to determine which LUNAMEs and LOCATIONs were active at the
time of failure.
00D31039
Explanation: The allocation of a connection to the remote system failed for one of the following reasons:
v The SYSIBM.USERNAMES table at the requesting site did not contain an outbound row and did not specify the
remote authorization ID to be used for this DB2 authorization ID.
v The SYSIBM.USERNAMES table at the requesting site contained an outbound row, but the specified remote
authorization ID, password, or both contained more than eight characters.
When the USERNAMES column in SYSIBM.LUNAMES or SYSIBM.IPNAMES is specified as 'O' or 'B', outbound
name translation is in use. The SYSIBM.USERNAMES table must contain entries that describe the remote
authorization IDs and passwords that are used for each DB2 authorization ID that communicates with the LU or the
TCP/IP address.
System action: The connection to the remote system is not allocated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: On the requesting system, make sure the USERNAMES column in
SYSIBM.LUNAMES or SYSIBM.IPNAMES is specified correctly for the indicated LUNAME or IPADDR. If you intend
to use remote authorization IDs that differ from the DB2 authorization IDs, verify that the SYSIBM.USERNAMES
table has rows that specify the remote authorization ID that is to be used for each possible DB2 authorization ID.
Each authorization ID must contain eight or fewer characters. If the remote connection communicates with the LU
and you intend to use remote passwords, verify that the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table has rows that specify the
remote password that is to be used for each possible DB2 authorization ID. Each password must contain eight or
fewer characters. These rows must specify 'O' in the TYPE column of the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table.
Problem determination: Determine the LUNAME or IPADDR and find the authorization ID, password, or both for
the failing remote system. Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Listing of the contents of the SYSIBM.IPNAMES and SYSIBM.LUNAMES tables at the local DB2 subsystem and the
remote DB2 subsystem.
v Listing of the contents of the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table at the local DB2 subsystem and the remote DB2
subsystem.
00D3103A
Explanation: Database access agent allocation failed because the RACROUTE REQUEST=EXTRACT macro failed to
locate a user profile for the DB2 primary authorization ID obtained from the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table. When the
ENCRYPTPSWDS column in SYSIBM.LUNAMES specifies 'Y', the requesting DB2 system must be able to extract the
encrypted password (via RACROUTE REQUEST=EXTRACT) and send this encrypted password to the responding
DB2 system for validation.
System action: The reason code is returned to the application.
Operator response: Notify the communications database administrator.
System programmer response: Make sure the new authorization ID column in SYSIBM.USERNAMES has been
specified correctly for the indicated LUNAME. If you intend to use encrypted passwords, the new authorization ID
must be defined to your MVS security subsystem.
Problem determination:
v Analyze the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table for an incorrect or missing entry.
v Verify that the names given in the NEWAUTHID column are defined to your MVS security subsystem properly.
00D3103B
Explanation: An attempt to allocate an LU6.2 conversation failed because the conversation limits for the requested
partner LU and VTAM MODE have been reached.
System action: This reason code is generated internally when an attempt is made to allocate an LU6.2 conversation
and conversation limits have been reached for the requested partner LU and VTAM MODE. In this situation, the
requesting DB2 system will attempt to reuse one of the existing LU6.2 conversations that have already been allocated
to the agent in question.
The allocate process will be retried using the existing conversation.
System programmer response: If you increase the LU6.2 conversation limits for the indicated partner LU and
VTAM MODE, it will not be necessary for DB2 to reclaim conversations in order to allocate additional LU6.2
conversations. The reclaiming process will reduce system throughput, since the reclaimed conversation will have to
service multiple SQL statements.
00D3103C
Explanation: An attempt was made to allocate an SNA (LU 6.2) conversation, but the authentication request failed
because the specified remote partner LUNAME will not allow authentication based on a user ID alone. The remote
partner LUNAME is configured to require authentication using a user ID and corresponding password.
A password must be provided throughDB2 application logic or throughDB2 Communications Database (CDB)
definitions. Alternately, the partner LUNAME can be configured to allow authentication based on user ID alone. For
example, specify LU 6.2 SECURITY=SAME or Already-Verified.
System action: The attempt to allocate an LU6.2 conversation fails, and the error is reported to theDB2 application
that requested access to the distributed resource.
System programmer response: If the remote LUNAME configuration can be changed, change it to allow Already
Verified (Security=Same) authentication, which does not require a password. If the target LUNAME is a DB2 for
z/OS system, support is declared by specifying SECACPT=ALREADYV on theDB2 VTAM APPL statement.
If remote LUNAME configuration changes are not appropriate, or if a higher level of security is required, then the
local DB2 for z/OS system must honor the requirements of the remote LUNAME and provide a password. It might
be possible to make application changes to provide a password. If application changes are not possible, CDB changes
will be required.
If the local application is DRDA related, and if it is executing an explicit SQL CONNECT statement to connect to the
remote system, consider changing the application to provide a password on the SQL CONNECT statement as
follows:
CONNECT TO server USING userid USING password
In the following circumstances, DB2 Communications Database tables must be changed to provide a password:
v The local application cannot be modified to provide a password on its SQL CONNECT statement.
v The application is performing an implicit SQL connection. (The application refers to a three-part name, or alias,
that resolves to the remote system.)
In these cases, change the SYSIBM.LUNAMES rows, which are associated to the partner LUNAME, to specify 'P'
(password) or 'R' (RACF PassTicket) for SECURITY_OUT. If you specify 'P', you must also:
v Add a SYSIBM.USERNAMES ¡°outbound¡± row that specifies the user ID and its associated password.
v Specify a SYSIBM.LUNAMES USERNAMES column value of 'O' or 'B' to satisfy referential constraints on the
SYSIBM.USERNAMES table.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v The VTAM APPL definition for the remote DB2 system.
v The contents of the SYSIBM.LUNAMES table.

00D3103D
Explanation: An attempt to allocate a VTAM LU6.2 conversation with a remote site failed because the request did
not contain the proper security information.
System action: The attempt to access the remote database resource failed and the failure is reported to the
application.
System programmer response: This error is usually caused by transmitting an invalid authorization ID or password
in a request to the remote site. However, this is not always the case, so it is important to review the diagnostic
information at the remote site to determine the cause of the failure.
v If the remote site is a DB2 subsystem, refer to the DSNL030I message at the remote site for the cause of the
security failure. Additionally, an ALERT will be recorded in NetView (if the NetView product is available) to
describe the security failure.
If the remote site is not a DB2 subsystem, obtain any diagnostic information about the security failure at the
remote site.
If you suspect the authorization ID or password is not correct, the DB2 CDB on the local DB2 system should be
examined to validate the following items:
v If the remote site requires both an authorization ID and a password on LU6.ALLOCATE requests (i.e., the remote
site does not accept already-verified ALLOCATE requests), the USERNAMES column of the SYSIBM.LUNAMES
table at the local DB2 system must specify either 'O' or 'B'.
v If the USERNAMES column of the SYSIBM.LUNAMES table at the local DB2 system specifies 'O' or 'B', the
SYSIBM.USERNAMES table will be used to determine the authorization ID and password sent on the
LU6.ALLOCATE request.
If you intend to translate the authorization IDs, ensure that the NEWAUTHID column of the
SYSIBM.USERNAMES table contains the correct authorization ID to be used at the remote site.
v If the remote site is a DB2 system, the ENCRYPTPSWDS value in the SYSIBM.LUNAMES table must exactly match
the ENCRYPTPSWDS column of the SYSIBM.LUNAMES table at the remote site.
v If the remote site is not a DB2 system, the ENCRYPTPSWDS value in the SYSIBM.LUNAMES table must be set to
'N'.
v If you are transmitting passwords to the remote site, the password transmitted by the local DB2 system must
exactly match the value expected by the remote site.
1. For encrypted passwords, the password sent to the remote DB2 subsystem is obtained by extracting the RACF
password of the user identified by the NEWAUTHID column in the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table. This user's
RACF password must exactly match the password at the remote site.
2. If password encryption is not used, the password will be taken from the PASSWORD column of the
SYSIBM.USERNAMES table. This value must exactly match the password at the remote site.
User response: Notify the communications database administrator.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Listing of the contents of the SYSIBM.IPNAMES and SYSIBM.LUNAMES tables at the local DB2 subsystem and the
remote DB2 subsystem.
v Listing of the contents of the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table at the local DB2 subsystem and the remote DB2
subsystem.
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00D3103E
Explanation: The requested VTAM function to allocate a conversation was not performed because the VTAM MODE
specified a conversation limit of zero. The conversation limits must be set to a value greater than zero before a
conversation can be allocated.
System action: The conversation is not allocated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you have placed entries in the SYSIBM.LUMODES table, make sure CONVLIMIT
column has a nonzero value. If you are allowing the session limits to be chosen by VTAM, make sure the DSESLIM
values on the VTAM APPL and mode entries are nonzero.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Determine the LUNAME and MODE name of the DB2 system that attempted to start a VTAM conversation.
v Print the contents of the SYSIBM.LUMODES table.
v Determine the session limits defined on the VTAM APPL statement and the VTAM MODE entry.
00D3103F
Explanation: An attempt to allocate a VTAM LU6.2 conversation with a remote site failed because the server at the
remote LU does not support the SNA two-phase commit process.
System action: DB2 starts a new conversation to the remote site that does not use two-phase commit. DB2 does not
attempt to use two-phase commit with this remote site until DDF is restarted.
System programmer response: This reason code is produced when the LU at the remote site supports two-phase
commit, but the TPN at the remote LU does not support two-phase commit. This is a normal situation, so no system
programmer action is required.
00D31040
Explanation: The requested VTAM function failed before the database access agent has failed. This is an internal
error.
System action: DB2 writes a SYS1.LOGREC record and requests an SVC dump at the failed DB2 site.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Determine which sites the abending agent was connected to by examining the
DSNL027 and DSNL028 SYSLOG console messages at the site of the DB2 failure. Obtain any related diagnostic
information from each connected site and the SVC dump and SYS1.LOGREC at the site of the DB2 failure.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output and the listing of the SYSLOG data set from each connected site for the period of time spanning
the failure.
v Listings of the SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1 at each connected site.
00D31041
Explanation: The requested VTAM function to allocate a conversation was not performed because the
SYSIBM.USERNAMES table at the responding site did not contain a row whose authorization ID column matches the
DB2 authorization ID received from the requesting DB2 system. When the USERNAMES column in
SYSIBM.LUNAMES specifies 'I' or 'B', inbound name translation is in effect. The SYSIBM.USERNAMES table must
contain entries describing the local DB2 authorization ID to be used for each DB2 authorization ID sent by the
requesting DB2 system.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC and the conversation is not allocated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Make sure the USERNAMES column in SYSIBM.LUNAMES has been specified
correctly for the indicated LUNAME. If you intend to use local authorization IDs that differ from the remote DB2
authorization ID, verify that the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table has rows that correctly specify the local authorization ID
to be used for each possible remote authorization ID. These rows must specify 'I' in the TYPE column of the
SYSIBM.USERNAMES table.
Problem determination: Determine the LUNAME and authorization ID for the failing VTAMCollect the following
diagnostic items:
v Listing of the contents of the SYSIBM.IPNAMES and SYSIBM.LUNAMES tables at the local DB2 subsystem and the
remote DB2 subsystem.
00D31042
Explanation: The requested VTAM function failed. The connection to the remote location was interrupted. This is an
internal error.

Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Obtain copies of the SYS1.LOGREC and SYSLOG data sets from each connected site,
the SVC dump at the site of the DB2 failure, and any related dumps from each connected site.

00D31044
Explanation: A remote subsystem has attempted to allocate a VTAM LU6.2 conversation, but the request was
rejected because the request did not contain the proper security information. The FMH5 received from the remote
subsystem did not contain any security subfields. This represents SECURITY=NONE in the LU6.2 architecture, which
is not supported by DB2.
System action: The attempt to access the remote database resource fails and the failure is reported to the
application.
A DSNL030I message may have been written to the console.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Verify that the remote subsystem is configured to send valid security subfields.
If the remote subsystem is DB2, make sure the VTAM APPL definition does not specify SECACPT=NONE, which is
the default for the VTAM APPL definition. SECACPT=NONE will cause VTAM to remove the security subfields from
the FMH5.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: Notify the communications database administrator.

00D31045
Explanation: A remote subsystem has attempted to allocate a VTAM LU6.2 conversation, but the request was
rejected because the request did not contain the proper security information. The FMH5 received from the remote
subsystem did not contain the security subfield that supplies the USERID, or the USERID was not 1 to 8 bytes in
length.
System action: The attempt to access the remote database resource fails and the failure is reported to the
application.

00D31046
Explanation: A remote subsystem has attempted to allocate a VTAM LU6.2 conversation, but the request was
rejected because the request did not contain the proper security information. The FMH5 received from the remote
subsystem indicated SECURITY=SAME (also known as Already-Verified) and the subsystem in question was not
authorized to send requests with SECURITY=SAME.
System action: The attempt to access the remote database resource fails and the failure is reported to the
application.
A DSNL030I message may have been written to the console.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: The request was rejected because the SECURITY_IN column of the
SYSIBM.LUNAMES table contained a 'V' in the row associated with the remote system. The value 'V' indicates that
the remote system must send both a USERID and a PASSWORD, which corresponds to SECURITY_PGM in the SNA
LU6.2 architecture. Users should also be aware that in the absence of a SYSIBM.LUNAMES row that specifically
identifies the remote LU, a "default" SYSIBM.LUNAMES row (blank LUNAME) may be used, if defined, if the
inbound connection is via DRDA protocols. This "default" row may not reflect the needed inbound security
characteristics in which case a SYSIBM.LUNAMES row can be defined that explicitly identifies the remote LU.
If the remote LU is a member of a remote sysplex and the local system requires access to the remote sysplex, then
members of the remote sysplex to be accessed must be defined in the local SYSIBM.LULIST table. In this case, the
remote sysplex LU can be defined in the local SYSIBM.LULIST table although a SYSIBM.LUNAMES definition,
default row or explicit definition, is appropriate in cases where it is undesirable to define the remote LU in
SYSIBM.LULIST (for example when you don't want the remote LU to be a candidate member when outbound
accessing the remote SYSPLEX location).
This problem can be corrected in two ways:
1. If you would like DB2 to accept requests that are marked with SECURITY=SAME, change the SECURITY_IN
value in the SYSIBM.LUNAMES table to 'A' for the remote LU in question. Also the DB2 VTAM APPL definition
should specify SECACPT=ALREADYV.
2. If you would like DB2 to continue to reject requests of this kind, the remote LU must be configured to send
requests that contain both a USERID and PASSWORD (SECURITY=PGM in SNA LU6.2 terms).
If the remote LU is DB2, the SECURITY_OUT column in the SYSIBM.LUNAMES table must specify either 'R' or
'P' in the row associated with the local DB2 subsystem.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.

Explanation: The requested VTAM function for allocating a conversation at the DB2 server was not performed
because the requester's LUNAME is not defined in the SYSIBM.LUNAMES table of the communication database
(CDB) at the server.
System action: Notification of the failure is returned to the application. The conversation is not allocated to the
specified location.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Add the requester's LUNAME to the SYSIBM.LUNAMES table at the server. If the
remote LU is DB2, the requester's LUNAME is the label name, as opposed to the ACBNAME keyword, on the DB2
VTAM APPL statement for the requester site. A server's SYSIBM.LUNAMES table should contain an entry for the
requester's LUNAME.
In the absence of a SYSIBM.LUNAMES row that specifically identifies the remote LU, a default SYSIBM.LUNAMES
row (blank LUNAME) might be used, if defined, in the case where the inbound connection is through DRDA
protocols. This default row might not reflect the needed inbound security characteristics, in which case a
SYSIBM.LUNAMES row can be defined that explicitly identifies the remote LU.
If the remote LU is a member of a remote sysplex and the local system requires access to the remote sysplex, then
members of the remote sysplex to be accessed must be defined in the local SYSIBM.LULIST table. In this case, the
remote sysplex LU can be defined in the local SYSIBM.LULIST table. A SYSIBM.LUNAMES definition, default row or
explicit definition, is appropriate in cases where it is undesirable to define the remote LU in SYSIBM.LULIST, such as
when you do not want the remote LU to be a candidate member when outbound accessing the remote SYSPLEX
location.
Verify that the condition did not occur because of the unintended use of a generic LU name, which would make DB2
aware of a partner LU name (its generic LU name) that is not specified in the LUNAME column of the
SYSIBM.LULIST or SYSIBM.LUNAMES tables. Look for evidence of a DSNL510I or DSNL030I message that indicates
the partner's generic LU name instead of its actual LU name. If the use of a generic LU name is indicated, use the
RESET GENERICLU command to purge this generic LU affinity.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:

Explanation: A request using application-directed access starting at site 'A' referenced an object at site 'B' that is
stored at site 'A'
System action: The application statement was not processed.
User response: Recode the application to remove the alias reference at the remote server that resolves to an object
stored at the local DB2. Objects stored at the local site must be referenced using a local name.
Problem determination: If necessary, consult with the database administrators at the local site and the remote server
location. Inspect the remote SYSIBM.SYSTABLES catalog table to determine the object at this location being
referenced in a circular manner.
00D3104A
Explanation: A remote server issued an SNA BACKOUT, which was not sent as a reply to an SNA PREPARE or
REQUEST_COMMIT. This indicates the server backed out the current unit of work without waiting for the SQL
application to either commit or roll back.
System action: The attempt to access the remote database resource fails and the failure is reported to the
application. DB2 terminates the SNA conversation to the remote server and forces the application to roll back.
System programmer response: DB2 never issues an unsolicited SNA BACKOUT. Non-DB2 servers can send an SNA
BACKOUT indication when resources required to complete the unit of work are not available. For example, a
deadlock might cause the non-DB2 server to send an SNA BACKOUT. Contact the system programmer for the
remote system to determine why the unit of work had to be aborted.
User response: Notify the DB2 systems programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00D3104B
Explanation: An SNA conversation was rejected by a DB2 server because the SNA FMH5 specified SNA persistent
verification. DB2 does not support the SNA persistent verification option.
System action: Message DSNL030I is displayed on the system console with reason code 00D3104B. The SNA
conversation is rejected with SNA sense code X'080F6051 ', indicating the SNA security parameters in the FMH5 were
not acceptable.
System programmer response: The SECACPT keyword on the VTAM APPL statement tells VTAM whether DB2
supports persistent verification. Because DB2 does not support persistent verification, the SECACPT=PERSISTV and
SECACPT=AVPV options cannot be used on DB2's VTAM APPL statement.
User response: Notify the DB2 system programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00D3104C
Explanation: The SNA Exchange Log Names (XLN) process failed because of a log name mismatch between DB2
and a remote LU in the network.
System action: The attempt to allocate an SNA two-phase commit conversation fails with reason code 00D3104C.
Message DSNL410 is displayed on the system console to describe the error.
System programmer response: The log name recorded in the DB2 log does not match the log name currently in use
at the remote LU. There are indoubt units of work that need to be resolved at this DB2 system. The log name
required to resolve the indoubt units of work is displayed in the DSNL410 message.
If a non-DB2 partner was started with the wrong log, it might be possible to restart the non-DB2 partner with the
desired log name. This should cause the indoubt units of work to be resolved automatically.
If the partner cannot be restarted with the desired log name, the -RECOVER INDOUBT command can be used to
resolve the indoubt units of work. Once the indoubt units of work are resolved, DB2 will accept an SNA XLN with a
new partner log name.
User response: Contact the DB2 systems programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00D3104D
Explanation: The local DB2 system does not support connectivity to the DB2 release currently running at the remote
DB2 site.
System action: The attempt to allocate an SNA conversation is rejected with reason code 00D3104D.
System programmer response: DB2 distributed database connections can only be established between compatible
DB2 releases. For example, DB2 Version 3 can connect to DB2 2.3, but not to DB2 2.2.
In order to establish connectivity, the down-level DB2 system must be migrated to a supported release of DB2.
User response: Contact the DB2 systems programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00D3104E
Explanation: An SNA Exchange Log Names (XLN) protocol violation was detected when attempting to establish a
connection to a remote site.
System action: The attempt to allocate an SNA conversation is rejected with reason code 00D3104E. Message
DSNL421E is written to the system console and IFCID 0213 is produced to describe the protocol violation.
System programmer response: Contact the system programmer for the remote site. The invalid XLN message is
recorded in the IFCID 0213 trace record. The system logic error that causes the invalid XLN message must be
corrected at the remote site.
User response: Contact the DB2 systems programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00D3104F
Explanation: A connection to a remote location was lost during a previous communication operation.
System action: If the communication failure occurred during a commit or abort operation, the SQL application
might not be aware that a failure occurred. Messages associated with the failure were written to the system console
at the time of failure. Additionally, alerts were reported to NetView at the time of failure.
User response: Reestablish the connection to the remote site and reissue the SQL statement.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
.
00D31050
Explanation: DB2 expected to receive security information for the remote client but a valid DRDA SECCHK
command was not received for a connection request from a DRDA application requester (AR). The DRDA SECCHK
command is only valid with a DRDA security manager level greater than or equal to 5.
This can be the case if one of the following occurs:
v The DRDA AR requested a DRDA security manager less than level 5 for an SNA connection where the APPL
command for DB2 was specified with the SECACPT=NONE option.
v The DRDA SECCHK command did not contain the required security information.
v The DRDA AR requested a DRDA security manager less than level 5 for a TCP/IP connection.
System action: The attempt to access the local database resource fails, the failure is reported to the SQL application,
and the conversation is terminated.
System programmer response: For SNA connections, if SECACPT=NONE and the DRDA AR does not support
DRDA security manager level 5, contact the DB2 security administrator to change the SECACPT option to
ALREADYV or CONV to allow for security information in the VTAM FMH-5 in the form of userid or
userid/password fields. If SECACPT=NONE is not changed, then DB2 cannot accept connection requests from this
remote client.
For SNA connections, If SECACPT=ALREADYV or CONV, then even though userid or userid/password fields in the
FMH-5 are received and validated, DB2 must evaluate a DRDA SECCHK command if it is sent. If the DRDA AR
requests this level of security but does not provide the correct information in the form of a SECCHK command, this
is a DRDA protocol error committed by the DRDA AR implementation at the remote client.
For TCP/IP connections, this is a DRDA protocol error committed by the DRDA AR implementation at the remote
client.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference. Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00D31052
Explanation: An application caused recursive access to a remote location, followed by access to another remote
location, which is not permitted.
For example, an application at location LOC1 might have connected to location LOC2 and accessed a table using an
alias that resolves back to LOC1. There was a subsequent remote access from LOC1 to LOCn, which caused the error.
System action: The attempt to access the remote location fails. The SQL application receives a -904 SQLCODE.
System programmer response: Correct the application program so that it does not cause recursive access to a
location followed by remote access from that location. The application might have used table aliases, three-part table
names, stored procedures, user-defined functions, or triggers to cause the condition.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Definitions of views and tables involved in the error.
v Location used in the alias entry in SYSIBM.SYSTABLES.
v Contents of the SYSIBM.LOCATIONS table.
00D31053
Explanation: The number of queued connection requests has reached the value of the MAXCONQN subsystem
parameter. The TCP/IP socket was closed for the longest-waiting connection in the connection request queue.
System action: The client is no longer connected to DB2.
User response: This reason code might indicate that a slowdown in the processing of requests occurred or is
occurring. Because the value of the MAXDBAT subsystem parameter has also been reached, you might need to
increase the value of the MAXDBAT subsystem parameter or determine the cause of the slowdown of the request
processing.

Explanation: DB2 detected a connection request that waited longer than the value of the MAXCONQN subsystem
parameter. The TCP/IP socket of the long-waiting connection request queue was closed.
System action: The client is no longer connected to DB2.

Explanation: The remote location defined in the SYSIBM.LOCATIONS table could not be accessed because the
TCP/IP interface to DDF is not available.
System action: The request to connect to a remote site fails. The SQL application receives a -904 SQLCODE.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: One of the following actions should be taken:
v If the remote site is not supposed to be using TCP/IP, add a row to SYSIBM.LUNAMES defining the LUNAME
used by the remote location.
v If the remote site is correctly defined in the CDB, examine the messages written to the console during -START DDF
processing. Those messages describe any errors that would prevent DDF from using TCP/IP.
v Determine if DB2 is started in restricted access mode. If so, retry the request when DB2 has been started in full
access mode.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.

Explanation: DB2 was able to find the row in SYSIBM.LOCATIONS for the LOCATION specified in the SQL
request. However, the LINKNAME column value specified in LOCATIONS did not match any row in
SYSIBM.LUNAMES or SYSIBM.IPNAMES.
System action: The request to connect to a remote site fails. The SQL application receives a -904 SQLCODE.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Insert a row in SYSIBM.LUNAMES or SYSIBM.IPNAMES that matches the
LINKNAME specified in SYSIBM.LOCATIONS.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
00D31058
Explanation: The IPADDR column of the SYSIBM.IPNAMES table could not be converted to an IP address by the
gethostbyname TCP/IP socket call.

.
00D31059
Explanation: An attempt to allocate a conversation to the remote site failed because DB2 was unable to obtain a
RACF PassTicket. The user specified an 'R' in the SECURITY_OUT column of the SYSIBM.IPNAMES or
SYSIBM.LUNAMES communications database (CDB) tables for the partner site. As a result, DB2 invokes RACF to
extract a PassTicket for the partner site. However, RACF could not provide a PassTicket, and the attempt failed.
System action: The attempt to access the remote database resource failed, and the failure is reported to the
application.
System programmer response: The error usually occurs due to incorrect or missing RACF definitions. To avoid this
error, specify the proper RACF definitions to provide for the PassTicket. Alternatively, you may avoid the use of
PassTickets by changing the SECURITY_OUT column of the SYSIBM.IPNAMES and/or SYSIBM.LUNAMES CDB
table for the partner site.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Listing of the results produced by the SQL statements.
v Listing of the contents of the SYSIBM.IPNAMES and SYSIBM.LUNAMES tables at the local DB2 subsystem and the
remote DB2 subsystem.
v Contents of the SYSIBM.LOCATIONS table.

Explanation: An SQL CONNECT statement was issued with a user ID and password to connect to a location that
requires RACF PassTicket authorization. The connection cannot be made.
The entry in SYSIBM.LUNAMES or SYSIBM.IPNAMES for the location that is specified on the SQL CONNECT
statement indicates that a connection request must contain a user ID and RACF PassTicket.
System action: The connection request is not processed. The application is placed in the unconnected and
connectable state.
User response: Change the application to eliminate its use of SQL CONNECT with a user ID and password, or
remove the RACF PassTicket requirement in SYSIBM.LUNAMES or SYSIBM.IPNAMES.
00D3105B
Explanation: An SQL CONNECT statement was issued with a user ID and password to connect to a location that
requires RACF encrypted password authorization. The connection cannot be made.

Explanation: A database access thread (DBAT) meets the requirement for becoming inactive but the limit specified
by the value of the MAXTYPE1 subsystem parameter has already been reached.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC, DSNL027I and DSNL028I messages have beenare written to
SYSLOG, and the thread is terminated.
Operator response: Collect the SYS1.LOGREC listing and the SVC dump.
System programmer response: The DBAT meets the requirements for becoming inactive because a nonzero value
has been specified for the MAXTYPE1 subsystem parameter. However, because the number of inactive DBATs has
already reached the MAXTYPE1 limit, the DBAT is terminated with this reason code. To correct the condition,
increase the value of the MAXTYPE1 subsystem parameter to allow additional inactive DBATs, or set the value to
zero.

00D3111F
Explanation: The maximum amount of buffered query data has been exceeded. Rather than return one block of
query data, the DRDA server system elected to return multiple extra blocks. Instead of fetching all rows in all the
extra blocks, the requesting application either executed an SQL statement that is not related to the query or executed
a commit while a held cursor was still open. DB2 buffers the extra in-transit blocks, however DB2 was not able to
buffer the entire set of extra blocks and thus truncated the result set. The application then resumed fetching and
attempted to fetch data beyond the point of truncation.
This SQLCODE can also be returned when the DRDA server system calculates the maximum amount of storage
required for processing query data, and finds the requested storage exceeds the system limit.
System action: The SQL statement fails.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Determine the failing application program and consider the following resolutions:
v The cursor definition may cause the server to return extra blocks. In this case, the cursor definition can be changed
to reduce the number of rows, thus extra blocks, being returned by the server.
DB2 for z/OS systems return extra blocks for cursors defined with the OPTIMIZER FOR n rows clause and will
return only enough extra blocks in order to return n rows. When a cursor is defined with OPTIMIZER FOR n
rows, either in the application or in a stored procedure, this indicates an application intent to fetch all n rows
before attempting to execute other SQL statements. The application is not abiding by its intent and is executing
other SQL, or committing, prior to fetching all n rows. In this case, the cursor definition can be changed to reduce
the value of n, or the application logic can be modified to fetch all n rows or to close the cursor before executing
the statement that caused the in-transit data to be buffered.
v The number of extra blocks returned can be controlled by DB2 installation parameters. The maximum number of
extra blocks requested by a DB2 requester system is determined by the "Extra Blocks Req" option of the DSNTIP5
DB2 installation panel. This value can be reduced which prevents the server system from returning more blocks
than the DB2 requester system can buffer.
Similarly, the server system may also provide a method to regulate the maximum number of extra blocks that it
will return to a requester. In this case, this number can also be reduced. For DB2 for z/OS systems, this is
determined by the EXTRA BLOCKS SRV field on the DSNTIP5 DB2 installation panel.
Examine the columns in the cursor select list. The columns in the select list can impact the amount of storage
required by the DRDA server for processing query data. The cursor definition can be changed to reduce the
number of columns in the select list, or the columns in the select list can be changed to have a smaller declared
length in the table. Both can reduce the required storage at the DRDA server to handle the query data.
For information about block fetching result sets, see DB2 Performance Monitoring and Tuning Guide.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Listing of the results produced by the SQL statements.
v Source listing of the failing application program.
00D31200
Explanation: DB2 thread inactivation processing failed to inactivate a database access thread (DBAT) because the
DBAT's unit of recovery state was marked as "inflight". This processing occurs only when DB2 is configured with
DDF Inactive Threads support (when the "DDF THREADS" field is set to "INACTIVE" in the DSNTIPR installation
panel). This error is an internal error.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC and an SVC dump is requested at the site of the DB2 abend.
System programmer response: Determine which sites the abending agent was connected to by examining the
DSNL027 and DSNL028 SYSLOG console messages at the site of the DB2 abend. Obtain copies of the SYS1.LOGREC
and SYSLOG data sets from each connected site, the SVC dump at the site of the DB2 failure, and any related dumps
from each connected site. If you suspect an error in DB2, refer to Part 2 of DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference for
information on identifying and reporting the problem.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output and the listing of the SYSLOG data set from each connected site for the period of time spanning
the failure.
v Listings of the SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1 at each connected site.
00D31201
Explanation: DB2 has detected an inconsistency in the TCP/IP PORT configuration parameter between the DRDA
and RSYNC ports. A BIND ipaddr was specified on the DRDA PORT statement in the PROFILE.TCPIP data set but
the BIND ipaddr was not specified on the RSYNC PORT statement in the PROFILE.TCPIP data set. When using
dynamic virtual IP addresses (VIPA), DB2 requires both the DRDA PORT and RSYNC PORT to be configured to use
a VIPA.
System action: DDF is abnormally terminated.
System programmer response: If using dynamic VIPA to bind to a DB2 PORT number, verify that a VIPA is defined
for both the DRDA PORT number and RSYNC PORT number by specifying the BIND ipaddr on the PORT statement
in the PROFILE.TCPIP data set used to reserve the PORTs for DB2. If not using dynamic VIPA to bind to DB2 PORT,
remove the BIND ipaddr option on the PORT statement in the PROFILE.TCPIP data set used to reserve the PORT
numbers for DB2. After fixing the TCP/IP PORT configuration statements, start DDF.
00D31202
Explanation: DB2 has detected an inconsistent change in the TCP/IP PORT configuration parameter for the RSYNC
PORT. A BIND ipaddr specified on the RSYNC PORT statement was changed in the PROFILE.TCPIP data set since
DDF was started.
System action: DDF is abnormally terminated. This change can cause outages because of invalid sysplex routing
information or commit resynchronization failures due to invalid IP addresses being returned to requesters.
System programmer response: Verify the BIND ipaddr specified on the RSYNC PORT number in the TCP/IP PORT
statement and start DDF.
00D31203
Explanation: A conversation was not allocated for one of these reasons:
v The LINKNAME was present in the SYSIBM.IPLIST table, but not in the SYSIBM.IPNAMES table.
v The IP Address contained in the IPADDR column of SYSIBM.IPLIST table was also present in the IPADDR column
of SYSIBM.IPNAMES table. A given IP Address can appear in only one of these two tables.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC and the conversation is not allocated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Make sure the LINKNAME in SYSIBM.IPLIST table is also defined in
SYSIBM.IPNAMES table. Make sure the IP Address is specified in the IPADDR column of SYSIBM.IPLIST table and a
blank value is specified in the IPADDR column of SYSIBM.IPNAMES table.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Print the contents of the SYSIBM.IPNAMES table.
v Print the contents of the SYSIBM.IPLIST table.
00D31204
Explanation: An outbound TCP/IP connection requires the use of IPv6 addressing but TCP/IP is not configured to
support IPv6 addressing.
System action: Notification of the failure is returned to the application.
System programmer response: The Communications Database (CDB) registration of the remote partner indicates
that an IPv6 address is to be used. That is, the location name being accessed by the application SQL refers to a
SYSIBM.LOCATIONS row. The SYSIBM.LOCATIONS row contains a LINKNAME that refers to a SYSIBM.IPNAMES
row. The SYSIBM.IPNAMES row contains an IPADDR value that indicates the use of IPv6 addressing, either by
explicitly specifying an IPv6 address or by referring to a domain name that resolves to an IPv6 address.
You must choose of the following actions:
v Configure TCP/IP to support IPv6 addressing.
v Make configuration changes to refer to only IPv4 addresses.
To configure TCP/IP to support IPv6 addressing, you must first ensure that TCP/IP is configured to use a dual-mode
IPv4 and IPv6 stack - the BPXPRMxx PARMLIB member must be modified to allow TCP/IP to behave as a
dual-mode stack. Other TCP/IP configuration changes are also required to define the IPv6 address. You can verify
that IPv6 addressing is correctly defined for DB2 purposes if the DB2 Display DDF command report, issued after
DDF is started, provides an IPv6 address.
If TCP/IP cannot be configured to support IPv6 addressing, you can only refer to IPv4 addresses. If the IPADDR
column, of the SYSIBM.IPNAMES CDB table, specifies an IPv6 address, you must change the IPADDR column to
refer to an IPv4 address. If the IPADDR column specifies a domain name that resolves to an IPv6 address by the
Domain Name Server (DNS), you must modify the DNS to resolve the domain name to an IPv4 address.
Make the appropriate changes and rerun the application.
00D31205
Explanation: A secure connection could not be established using z/OS Application Transparent-Transport Layer
Security (AT-TLS). The reason that this code was issued depends on whether the connection attempt was inbound or
outbound:
Inbound connections
DB2 has detected an invalid use of a secure port. A non-secure TCP/IP connection is attempting to access
DB2 using a secure port without an AT-TLS policy established for the connection.
Outbound connections
DB2 cannot establish a secure connection with the remote location.
System action: The system action depends on whether the connection was inbound or outbound:
Inbound connections
The attempted connection request is terminated. If no instance of message DSNL030I has been written to the
system console in the preceding five minutes, message DSNL030I is written to the system console.
Outbound connections
The request to connect to the remote site fails. The SQL application receives SQLCODE -904.
System programmer response: z/OS AT-TLS transparently performs transport layer security (TLS) on behalf of DB2
by invoking the z/OS System Secure Socket Layer (SSL) in the TCP transport layer. AT-TLS uses a policy-based
configuration, and the Policy Agent application is required to define AT-TLS rules and actions to the TCP/IP stack
for TCP connections.
1. Use the reports generated by the z/OS UNIX pasearch and TCP/IP NETSTAT TTLS commands to verify that an
AT-TLS policy exists and has been defined for the appropriate port.
Inbound connections
The secure port that DB2 uses for accepting secure TCP/IP connections.
Outbound connections
The remote port that DB2 uses to establish a secure TCP/IP connection with the remote location.
2. Ensure that AT-TLS is enabled for this connection.
User response: Verify that the correct port number has been specified for the connection to the target server. For a
secure connection, the port number should be the target DB2 SECURE PORT, in which case an AT-TLS policy is
required.
If you want to access DB2 without a secure connection, specify the DB2 DRDA PORT.

Explanation: The MAXFILEPROC limit was exceeded and the thread was not allowed to connect to DB2.
System action: The requester is not connected to DB2.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: The maximum number of sockets that can be opened concurrently is defined by the
installation option MAXFILEPROC. When the MAXFILEPROC limit is exceeded, threads are not allowed to connect
to DB2. This message will be issued by DSNLILNR if DB2 is acting as the server listening on a socket and the
conversation was abnormally deallocated or by DSNLIAAC when DB2 is acting as the requester initiating a
connection and the connection was not allocated.
Make the appropriate changes and rerun the application.
Problem determination: Analyze the statistics class 4 trace record identified by the IFCID sequence number
enumerated in the DSNL032I message. For the DB2 system generating the DSNL032I message, collect the following

Explanation: The database access request from a remote site failed because the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table did not
contain an inbound row, the TYPE column specified as an 'I' describing the DB2 authorization ID to be used for the
remote primary authorization ID. When the USERNAMES column in SYSIBM.LUNAMES specifies 'I' or 'B' requiring
inbound name translation, the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table must contain entries describing which DB2 authorization
IDs are to be used for each remote authorization ID from the LU.
System action: The DSNL030I message is issued at the server. The database access agent is not allocated.
Operator response: Notify the communications database administrator.
System programmer response: Make sure the USERNAMES column in SYSIBM.LUNAMES has been specified
correctly for the indicated LUNAME. If you intend to use remote authorization IDs that differ from DB2
authorization IDs, verify that the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table has rows that correctly specify the DB2 authorization

IDs to be used for every possible remote authorization ID.
Problem determination: Analyze the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table for an incorrect or missing entry.
00D3443F
Explanation: The connection to the remote server failed. The SYSIBM.USERNAMES table did not contain an
outbound row and did not specify the remote authorization ID for the package owner DB2 authorization ID. When
the USERNAMES column in SYSIBM.LUNAMES or SYSIBM.IPNAMES is specified as 'O' or 'B', outbound name
translation is in use. The SYSIBM.USERNAMES table must contain entries that describe the remote authorization IDs
that are used for each DB2 authorization ID that communicates with the LU or the TCP/IP address.
System action: A response is sent to the application to indicate that the resource is unavailable. The request is not
sent to the remote site.
Operator response: Notify the communications database administrator.
System programmer response: Make sure the USERNAMES column in SYSIBM.LUNAMES or SYSIBM.IPNAMES is
specified correctly for the indicated LUNAME or IPADDR. If you intend to use remote authorization IDs that differ
from the DB2 authorization IDs, verify that the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table has rows that specify the remote
authorization ID to be used for each possible DB2 authorization ID. These rows must specify 'O' in the TYPE column
of the SYSIBM.USERNAMES table.

a stored procedure call. DB2 returns a CMDCHKRM to the requester.
v An EXCSQLIMM or EXCSQLSTT command was received from the requester specifying an invalid QRYINSID
instance variable. DB2 returns a VALNSPRM to the requester, writes an IFCID 192 trace record, and generates a
DSNL032I console message.
System action: Message DSNL032I is written to the console. A DDM reply message is returned to the requester
system.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For

The local DB2 has received an ENDUOWRM that indicates that the remote server processed a dynamic ROLLBACK
request successfully; however, the server should not have processed the ROLLBACK for one of the following reasons:
v The server was not available to update
v The server was participating in two phase commit protocols with the current request
System action: An alert is generated. If this error has not been previously detected, then message DSNL031I is
written to the MVS console and trace record containing the reply from the remote server are written in statistics class
4. If the error was already detected, information from the previous occurrence can be used to diagnose the problem.
During execution, the application will receive an SQLCODE -904 for this operation. The connection to the server will
be terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For

00D34445
Explanation: The distributed relational data system (DRDS) subcomponent detected an error while processing a
DDM CNTQRY command received from a remote requester.
A previous CNTQRY command specified a QRYROWSET parameter, which indicated the number of rows to be
returned as a rowset. Because of the blocking limits in effect with the requester, only a partial rowset was returned to
the requester. Some rows in the requested rowset are still unfetched and are pending. The DRDA rules require that
this subsequent CNTQRY command must either:
v Specify a QRYROWSET value that is equal to the number of pending rows in the rowset.
v Reset the query blocks from the pending rowset
The CNTQRY command did not specify the QRYRSTBLK parameter to reset the query blocks, so this command is
assumed to completes the pending rowset. Because the requested QRYROWSET value does not equal the number of
pending rows in the rowset that was requested by the previous CNTQRY, a DRDA exception occurred.
System action: Message DSNL032I is written to the console, and a DDM reply message (PRCCNVRM) is returned
to the requester system.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For

Explanation: The distributed relational data system (DRDS) subcomponent detected an error while processing a
DDM CNTQRY command received from a remote requester. The CNTQRY is fetching data from a scrollable cursor
which is being accessed in a scrollable manner by the requester. The CNTQRY command will return one or more
LOB columns as LOB data, but the RTNEXTDTA parameter on the CNTQRY command (indicating how LOB values
are to be returned) did not specify RTNEXTALL as required by the DRDA rules. A DRDA exception is generated.
System action: Message DSNL032I is written to the console, and a DDM reply message (PRCCNVRM) is returned
to the requester system.

Explanation: The distributed relational data system (DRDS) subcomponent detected an error while processing a
DDM CNTQRY command received from a remote requester. A previous CNTQRY command specified a
QRYROWSET parameter, indicating the number of rows to be returned as a rowset. Because of the blocking limits in
effect with the requester, only a partial rowset was returned to the requester and a number of rows in the requested
rowset are still unfetched, and remain in pending state. The DRDA rules require that this subsequent CNTQRY
command either reset the pending query blocks by means of the QRYRSTBLK parameter or must explicitly or
implicitly specify a FETCH NEXT orientation (RELATIVE+1) to complete the pending rowset.The CNTQRY
command did not reset the pending rowset and did not specify the FETCH NEXT orientation, resulting in a DRDA
exception.
System action: The message DSNL032I is written to the console. Refer to the description of this message for further
information.
A DDM reply message (PRCCNVRM) is returned to the requester system.

Explanation: A remote application connected to a DB2 server and issued an SQL statement that contain a three-part
name or alias that refers to an table or view at a remote location. However, the remote reference actually resolves to
the local DB2 server location. This situation can occur when the SQL statement refers to a location alias but the
package for the application was bound before the location alias was defined.
System action: The SQL statement is rejected.
User response: Bind the application package at the server after the location alias is defined. For a data sharing
group, ensure that the location alias is defined on all members.
Problem determination: Use the DISPLAY DDF command to determine the location aliases for the server. Ensure
that any location alias references in the application exist at the server when the package is bound.

Explanation: The distributed data interchange system (DDIS) component detected an internal error. This is a DB2
internal error.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC and an SVC dump is requested at the site of the abend.
Messages DSNL027 and DSNL028 are written to the console. If the conversation is terminated as a result of the
abend, DSNL500I is also written.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Identify all connected systems participating in the processing of the remote request. This
includes the requester system to which the application is connected and the data server which is the target of the
remote request. This may include intermediate server systems. Determine which sites the abending agent was
connected to by examining the DSNL027 and DSNL028 SYSLOG console messages at the site of the DB2 abend.
For each connected system that is a DB2 system collect the diagnostic items:
v Console output and the listing of the SYSLOG data set from each connected site for the period of time spanning
the failure.
v Listings of the SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1 at each connected site.

00D35030
Explanation: DB2, acting as a DRDA server, detected an error while processing an SQL request from a remote
DRDA client. DB2 was building a DDM query descriptor (QRYDSC or FDODSC) to return to the DRDA client, but
could not do so because the descriptor required more late environment descriptors (LEDs) than DB2 can support.
System action: The DBAA is abended. The conversation with the remote site is terminated. At the server console,
the DSNL027I message is issued, accompanied by one or more DSNL028I messages identifying all remote sites where
the distributed agent also exists and where diagnostic information might also be collected.
Operator response: Notify the application programmer or user creating the SQL statement.
If the remote DRDA client is a DB2 for MVS system, collect the following diagnostic items:
v Statistics Class 4 trace record for the LUWID associated with the failing request.
For other remote DRDA clients, refer to the client product documentation for diagnostic recommendations.

v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v All dumps taken by the attachment facility or requesting application.
User response: The SQL request issued by the client cannot be processed by DB2. As a circumvention, the SQL
request can be simplified to reduce the number of LEDs required to describe the data using DRDA. LEDs may be
required, for example, if columns being fetched are in a different code page (CCSID) than the default CCSID for the
DB2 for MVS system.

Explanation: IMS has detected a problem with the call to IMS ROLL or ROLB causing the DB2 DL/I batch support
to stop processing. In most cases, the ROLB call has BKNO=NO (which is the default setting) and you have used a
temporary data set.
System action: The DB2 DL/I batch support processing is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: One of two errors can result in this reason code: an incorrect ROLB call or an
application program error.
In most cases, the ROLB has incorrect settings and data. Complete the following actions to correct the ROLB call
settings:
1. Validate that you are using an existing data set that is not temporary.
2. Validate that the BKN setting is set to YES.
3. Resubmit the job.
Sometimes an application program error can cause this reason code. Complete the following actions to correct the
application error:
1. Check the PCB status code for a non-blank value.
2. Validate that the PCB used for the call is correct.
3. Validate the that parameters passed by the call is correct.
4. Resubmit the job.

Explanation: DB2 detected an inconsistent condition. The index entry for a LOB does not point to a valid LOB in
the auxiliary table. The error is probably caused by an extra index entry, but it could also result from a table update
not being redone when it should have been or from a point-in-time recovery.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC and an SVC dump is requested.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For

Explanation: Either the data space manager (DSM) subcomponent of DB2 could not access some storage group
definition, or the storage group contains no volume IDs. Possible sources of the error include use of an incorrect
name for the storage group and removal of all volume IDs via ALTER STOGROUP without providing new ones.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the caller.
System programmer response: Notify the database administrator if appropriate. Otherwise, check the SQLCA for
the name of the storage group. Check this storage group (via an SQL SELECT on SYSIBM.SYSSTOGROUP) to ensure
that it exists. Check for associated SYSIBM.SYSVOLUMES table entries to see if any volume IDs exist for this storage
group.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: If you are unable to resolve the problem yourself, notify the system programmer or database
administrator.
Problem determination: Obtain output listing from SELECT * FROM SYSIBM.SYSSTOGROUP and SELECT * FROM
SYSIBM.SYSVOLUMES, details of the request that resulted in this code, and contents of the SQLCA. Also obtain
operator's console sheet showing related messages, if any. Use this documentation to determine the cause of the
problem.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of

00D70002
Explanation: The required data sets are not available to DB2. This is probably a user error. For example, the user
might have forgotten to create the needed VSAM data clusters using access method services before issuing a CREATE
TABLESPACE request with the USING VCAT parameter.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user.
System programmer response: Take one or both of these actions:
v Make the needed data set available.
v Be sure it is cataloged in the appropriate integrated catalog facility (ICF) catalog.
The data set names appear in the SQLCA, in the DSNP-prefixed message that contained this code, or in an earlier
DSNP-prefixed message for the same user (same connection and correlation IDs).
If the data set name is correct, is cataloged, and appears in the VTOC, run the access method services DIAGNOSE
command on the integrated catalog facility (ICF) catalog identified by the first qualifier of the data set name.
User response: If you are unable to resolve the problem, notify the system programmer or database administrator.
Problem determination: Obtain the following information to determine the cause of the problem:
v Listings of the integrated catalog facility (ICF) catalog and VTOC showing the data set
v Details of the request that led to this code
v The contents of the SQLCA
v The operator's console sheet showing any related messages

Related information:
DIAGNOSE command (DFSMS Access Method Services for Catalogs)
00D70003
Explanation: Some or all of the data sets already exist. The data space manager (DSM) subcomponent of DB2 has
discovered the preexistence of a data set that has the same name as one it was about to create. The name of the data
set appears in the SQLCA or in messages DSNP002I or DSNP022I.If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to
report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting
data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
This may occur if a user creates a data set with VSAM access method services (intending to use it for a table space or
index), then creates the table space or index via SQL CREATE statement, but forgets to specify USING VCAT.
Another possibility is that the data set remained from some prior, unsuccessfully completed DROP or DELETEor
backout operation of DB2. This failure would probably occur if the data set or integrated catalog facility (ICF) catalog
were unavailable at the time of the DROP or DELETE or backout. For example, packs may be offline, or other
operational problems may exist. In this case, the table space would be dropped, but the data sets could remain and
be brought back online at a later time.
There should have been some indication of this type of failure at the time it occurred. (for example, some
DSNP-prefixed message indicating the data set was not deleted). You might check recent console sheets for such a
message; however, it may have happened a long time ago.
System action: Error indication is returned to the user.
System programmer response: Notify the database administrator if appropriate. Otherwise, either use access
method services to delete the data set or use a different name for the table or index you are trying to create.
If the data set name is correct, is cataloged, and appears in the VTOC, run the access method services DIAGNOSE
command against the integrated catalog facility (ICF) catalog identified by the first qualifier of the data set name.
User response: If you are unable to resolve the problem yourself, notify the system programmer or database
administrator.
Problem determination: Information is needed concerning the history of the use of this data set; that is, of the table
space/index name in conjunction with this database name. Listings of the console, integrated catalog facility (ICF)
catalog, and VTOC may also be needed, with details of the request that resulted in this code, and contents of the
SQLCA. Also obtain operator's console sheet showing related messages, if any. Use this documentation to determine
the cause of the problem.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of

00D70004
Explanation: Certain data sets are pending deletion. Creation of a new data set is blocked by the presence of the
name on a drop list. This is usually a user error. It usually occurs when the user has dropped an old object (table
space, index, and so forth) and then attempted to redefine it without committing the drop.
System action: Error indication is returned to the user.
System programmer response: The user must commit the drop of the data set on the drop list. Collect the materials
listed in the Problem Determination section of this message to determine the specific cause of the problem.
User response: You must commit the drop prior to redefining. Notify the system programmer or database
administrator, if necessary.
Problem determination: Documentation is needed showing activities from the last committed action up to and
including details of the request that resulted in this code. You also need to examine the contents of the SQLCA. Also
obtain operator's console sheet showing related messages, if any. Use this documentation to determine the cause of
the problem. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying
and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.

00D70006
Explanation: The data sets are not owned by this DB2 subsystem. The data sets backing a table space or index can
be deleted only by the data space manager (DSM) subcomponent of the DB2 subsystem that created them or by one
having the same authorization ID at the time of installation. This is a safety feature to restrict DSM from deleting
data sets that might have been created by the user but that have a name that matches the one we are trying to delete.
This safety feature also prevents the deletion of data sets that might have been created by some other DB2 subsystem
and that are still needed there.
System action: The data sets remain intact.
User response: If you are unable to resolve the problem yourself, notify the system programmer or database
administrator.
Problem determination: Obtain integrated catalog facility (ICF) catalog and VTOC listings, details of the request
that resulted in this code, and contents of the SQLCA. Also obtain operator's console sheet showing related messages,

Explanation: During allocation of a data set, DB2 detected that the attributes for the data set were incorrect. The
data set requires the extended format and extended addressability attributes that are defined through DFSMS. Either
the data set was defined without the required attributes, or it was not defined through DFSMS.
System action: No data set is allocated. SQLCODE -904 is issued. Additional messages or codes might be issued.
System programmer or storage administrator response: Data sets that are larger than 4GB must belong to a DFSMS
data class that is defined with the extended format and extended addressability attributes.
1. If the diagnostic message that issued this code includes a reference to STOGROUP 00000001, then the data set is a
catalog or directory data set. Use the LISTCAT command to determine the name of the data set.
2. Update the data set class definition in DFSMS. On the DATA SET CLASS DEFINE panel, specify the following
values:
Field Value
DATA SET NAME TYPE EXT
EXTENDED ADDRESSABILITY Y
3. Make sure that the automatic class selection routine associates this data set with this data class.
User response: Notify the system programmer or storage administrator.

LISTCAT command (DFSMS Access Method Services for Catalogs)
00D70009
Explanation: The specified data set was access method services user-defined. It does not have the required DB2
attributes. The data set was defined with a Control Interval (CI) size that is incompatible with the page size. A
compatible CI size is either 4K or the page size. For example, if the page size is 32K, the ControlIntervalSize
parameter in the Define command should be specified with either 4K or 32K. DB2 recommends the use of the page
size as the Control Interval size.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user. This reason code and the data set name are
made available to the user in the SQLCA.
System programmer response: Ensure that the data set is defined with the compatible CI size, which is 4K or its
page size.
User response: Delete the data set that was named and redefine it with the correct CI attributes.
Problem determination: Obtain an access method services LISTCAT for the named data set's attributes.

Explanation: This is an internal error. An attempt to extend a data set failed because a problem was detected in the
DSM notify process.
System action: The data sharing extend is incomplete.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer or database administrator.
System programmer response: For additional information, see the description of message DSNP021I.
Problem determination: Obtain the console sheet showing the associated DSNP021I message and any related
messages preceding that message.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
00D70011
Explanation: The data space manager (DSM) subcomponent of DB2 has been requested to extend a table space or
index space, but the table space or index space has already been extended to its maximum size. This does not mean
there is no more space available in the page set for the requested insert. An additional search will be performed for
space in the current table space or index space. If space cannot be found, then the data manager component will
issue reason code 00C9009C for a partitioned page set or 00C9009D for a non-partitioned page set.
For the name of the data set from which the name of the table space, index space, and/or partition can be derived,
see message DSNP001I or DSNP007I and the SQLCA.
System action: No extension is done.
System programmer response: Notify the database administrator if appropriate. Otherwise, if the table space is
partitioned and there is space in other partitions, you may be able to redefine the table space with new partitioning
parameters so that the data that has overloaded this partition is directed to others. If the table space is not
partitioned, you probably have more than one table residing in this table space. Define another table space, unload
this one, then reload the tables into the separate spaces. (Be aware that this is a very large amount of data to move.
Careful planning is recommended.)
User response: If you are unable to resolve the problem yourself, notify the system programmer or database
administrator.
Problem determination: If you believe the table space or index space has not yet reached maximum size, provide
listings of the console, integrated catalog facility (ICF) catalog, and VTOC.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v IDCAMS LISTCAT output for the ICF (VSAM) catalog that contains the DB2 subsystem catalog that defined the
failing index or table.
v VTOC listing of the disk volume on which the failing operation occurred.
v Listing of the results produced by the SQL statements.
v Listing of DB2 catalog tables.
v SYSPRINT output, including JCL, for the application program or batch job, and system messages that were issued.
Make sure that MSGLEVEL=(1,1) on the JOB statement so that all diagnostic information is sent to SYSPRINT.
v Definitions of views and tables involved in the error.

Explanation: A password or security error has occurred. An attempt to access a integrated catalog facility (ICF)
catalog entry for a cluster (data set) failed because of some security violation. This is probably a user error. It may be
caused either by the incorrect specification of a password or the changing of the password in the DB2 catalog (via
SQL ALTER) but not in the integrated catalog facility (ICF) catalog (via access method services ALTER) or vice versa.
System action: A 'resource not available' code is returned to the user.
System programmer response: Notify the database administrator if appropriate. Otherwise, check the passwords
and/or RACF authorizations.
User response: Ensure that the correct password is being used. If you are unable to resolve the problem yourself,
notify the database administrator.
Problem determination: Obtain output from SQL SELECT * FROM SYSIBM.SYSTABLESPACE and (if storage group
related) SELECT * FROM SYSIBM.SYSSTOGROUP. Also obtain integrated catalog facility (ICF) catalog listing, details
of the request that resulted in this code, and contents of the SQLCA. Also obtain operator's console sheet showing
related messages, if any. This documentation will assist you in determining the cause of the problem if it is not
merely an incorrect password. If you suspect an error in DB2, If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to
report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting
data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.

00D70018
Explanation: This is a DB2 internal error. One of the following circumstances has occurred:
v A data set inquiry function was called for a partitioned table space or index space. Its function applies only to
nonpartitioned table spaces or index spaces.
v The reset function of data space manager (DSM) was called on a table space that had been opened incorrectly.
System action: Abort the request.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Collect the materials listed in the Problem Determination section of this message. If
you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting
the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Request a dynamic dump. In the dump, the second parameter passed to the data set
inquiry function identifies the table space or index space. The third parameter is the table space or index space object
descriptor block (OBD). The OBD indicates whether or not the table space or index space is partitioned. If it is
partitioned, the calling module is in error. If it is not partitioned, the test in the data set inquiry function must be at
fault.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).

Explanation: The data space manager (DSM) subcomponent of DB2 could not release the extend lock it acquired
against a data set during an attempt to extend that data set.
System action: The SQL request that led to the abend is terminated, and the unit of recovery that issued the request
is backed out.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Investigate the DSM messages associated with this condition (at least message
DSNP015I) for clues to the problem. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: This problem is probably the result of either: (1) an attempt by DSM to free a lock it did
not hold or, (2) a problem in IRLM. The IRLM return and reason codes appear in the associated DSNP015I message.
For additional information, see the description of this message.

Explanation: There is an insufficient amount of space in primary allocation to format control pages.
System action: The requested table space or index space creation is backed out.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer or database administrator.
System programmer response: Notify the database administrator if appropriate. Otherwise, increase the primary
allocation value in the data set that was defined directly via access method services. (This should not happen for
storage group related data sets, because the DB2 interpreter ensures a sufficient setting for the primary value.)
Problem determination: Obtain integrated catalog facility (ICF) catalog and VTOC listings, details of the request
that led to this code, and contents of the SQLCA. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the
problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2

00D70024
Explanation: No data sets exist for a nonpartitioned table space or index space. Because at least one existed at create
time, a serious problem might have occurred for this table space or index space. The name of the data set that DB2
expected to find for the table space or index space appears in message DSNP012I and/or in the SQLCA along with
the reason code.
System action: The request is terminated.
System programmer response: Ensure that the data set and its pack are available to DB2 and that the data set has
not been inadvertently deleted or migrated by any DASD operation.
If the data set name is correct, is cataloged, and appears in the VTOC, run the access method services DIAGNOSE
command on the integrated catalog facility (ICF) catalog identified by the first qualifier of the data set name.
Problem determination: Obtain the following items:

reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
00D70027
Explanation: The secondary allocation value is 0. No physical extension is done. If this occurs in a create of a
segmented table, the primary allocation of the table space is not big enough to allocate the first segment. The first
segment consists of a number of pages which are defined in SEGSIZE.
System action: The request to extend the data set is terminated.
System programmer response: Notify the database administrator if appropriate. Otherwise, if you intended to allow
physical extension of the data set, change its secondary value to a nonzero quantity.
Problem determination: Obtain the integrated catalog facility (ICF) catalog and VTOC listings, and (if storage
group-defined) the output from SELECT * FROM SYSIBM.SYSSTOGROUP. Also obtain details of the request that

Explanation: An HSM request for the recall of a migrated data set failed.
System action: The HSM recall is aborted by data space manager and control returns to the function that issued the
recall request. The higher level function will not necessarily terminate processing since the data set may have already
been recalled.
Operator response: If processing was terminated, notify the system programmer or database administrator.
System programmer response: If processing was terminated, investigate the reason for the HSM failure via
messages issued to the MVS operator's console. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the
problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2
Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Refer to the problem determination section(s) of the associated DB2 and HSM messages
which were issued to the MVS operator's console.
Collect the following diagnostic item listed in
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
00D70029
Explanation: DB2 could not access a data set because the data set is on a volume that is offline.
System action: The request to access the data set is terminated.
System programmer response: Ensure that the proper volumes are online. See console message DSNP012I or
DSNT500I.
Problem determination: Obtain the following logs to find the failing data set name:
v The operator's console log that contains either the related DSNP012I message with CTLGRC=00000008
CTLGRSN=xxxx0532, or, message DSNT500I with REASON 00D70029.
v The job log that contains the 00D70029 code.
Use ISPF, ISMF, or other facility to locate the volumes and device numbers where the data set resides. Vary the
volume, or volumes, back online.
00D70030
Explanation: Unexpected reason code was received from some DB2 subcomponent invoked by data space manager
(DSM).
Almost any DSNP module can issue this reason code.
System action: Abort the request.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: There is not much the system programmer can do here, but see register 2 in the
accompanying dump for the unexpected code. Its description may provide a clue to the type of problem. If you
suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the
problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Obtain a listing of the SQL request that resulted in this code and a listing of the contents of
the SQLCA. Also obtain operator's console sheet showing related messages, if any. There should be at least one
DSNP-prefixed message containing the '00D70030' code. Messages preceding it from other subcomponents (having
other prefixes beginning with DSN) may provide additional details about the problem.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.

Explanation: One of the following is issued on a ROSHARE OWNER database:
v A CREATE TABLESPACE statement
v A CREATE INDEX statement, or
v The REORG utility with SHRLEVEL REFERENCE or SHRLEVEL CHANGE using user-managed data sets
However, the data sets are not defined with VSAM SHAREOPTIONS(1,3).
System action: An SQLCODE -731 is returned to the user (for CREATE TABLESPACE or INDEX) The CREATE
TABLESPACE or INDEX statement or the REORG utility is not executed.
User response: Use AMS ALTER SHAREOPTIONS to alter the data set to SHAREOPTIONS(1,3) and resubmit the
CREATE TABLESPACE or INDEX statement or the REORG utility.
00D70052
Explanation: An ALTER DATABASE statement is issued to convert a database to ROSHARE OWNER. But, within
this database, at least one user defined data set is not defined with VSAM SHAREOPTIONS(1,3). All user-defined
data sets that are within this database must be converted to SHAREOPTIONS(1,3) before the database can be altered
to ROSHARE OWNER.
System action: An SQLCODE -731 is returned to the user and the ALTER DATABASE statement is not performed.
User response: Use AMS ALTER SHAREOPTIONS to alter all user-defined data sets that are within this database to
SHAREOPTIONS(1,3), and resubmit the ALTER DATABASE statement.
00D70100
Explanation: A requested resource is not available. Either the data space manager (DSM) or some subcomponent
that it invoked discovered that some resource is not available. The name and type of the resource and the reason it is
unavailable are placed in the CT control block by the subcomponent that made the discovery. This information is
made available to the user in the SQLCA and/or messages. The reason code in the CT/SQLCA contains the identifier
of the subcomponent that discovered the problem.
Almost any DSNP module can issue this reason code.
System action: Abort the current request.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer or database administrator.
System programmer response: Notify the database administrator if appropriate. Otherwise, determine what
resource was unavailable (from SQLCA information) and, if it is something you can control, make it available. If you
suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the
problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: See the Problem Determination section in the description of the code that appears in the
SQLCA or CTRURESN field of the CT and/or in the description of any associated console messages. Obtain details
of the request that resulted in this code, and contents of the SQLCA. Also obtain operator's console sheet showing
related messages, if any.

00D90000
Explanation: A recovery manager module received control from its FRR for retry and found an invalid retry point
identifier. The name of the module in which the failure occurred appears in the SYS1.LOGREC entry showing this
reason code in register 15.
System action: Standard DB2 diagnostic information is provided. The error is recorded in SYS1.LOGREC, an SVC
dump is scheduled, and DB2 subsystem termination is requested. The subsystem termination reason code reflects the
function for which retry was unsuccessfully attempted.
Operator response: Print SYS1.LOGREC, and restart DB2.
System programmer response: This is a secondary subsystem error. Obtain a copy of SYS1.LOGREC and the SVC
dump for this failure and for the original failure that resulted in the retry attempt.
Problem determination: Examine the SYS1.LOGREC information and the dumps from both the original failure and
this second failure to determine if the recovery parameter area was damaged or if retry incorrectly restored registers
for the mainline module.
00D90003
Explanation: A failure occurred while DB2 was attempting to open an object in the shared communications area
(SCA).
System action: Standard DB2 diagnostic information is recorded in SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested

00D90010
Explanation: During the process of re-enabling data sharing, all members, other than the surviving member, are
forced to cold start. In the process of setting up the cold start for this member, an active conditional restart control
record was discovered in the BSDS. This record could not have been in the BSDS when data sharing was disabled,
and this DB2 should have been inactive since data sharing was disabled; therefore, it is unclear what the conditional
restart control record is requesting.
System action: Standard DB2 diagnostic information is recorded in SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested
before DB2 subsystem termination is initiated.
System programmer response: Use the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility to cancel the active conditional
restart control record in this member's BSDS.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.

00D90013
Explanation: The restart parameters for TRKRSITE are invalid. If TRKRSITE is YES on DSNZPARM and this DB2
subsystem has not successfully restarted in this 'Tracker Recovery cycle', DB2 requires special conditions before it can
restart.
System action: DB2 startup terminates.
Operator response: Collect the SYS1.LOGREC and SVC dump, and contact the system programmer.
System programmer response: Ensure that the Conditional Restart Control Record is correct, then restart DB2. You
can run the Print Log Map Utility (DSNJU004) to examine the current Conditional Restart record. The following
conditions are correct:
v BACKOUT = NO
v FORWARD = NO
v Either an ENDRBA value for non-data sharing or an ENDLRSN value for data sharing. In data sharing, the
ENDLRSN value must be the same for all members restarting in this 'Tracker Recovery cycle'.
To avoid a cold start or log skipping in a tracker site, ensure that STARTRBA has no specified value. You can create
or modify the Conditional Restart parameters with the Change Log Inventory Utility (DSNJU003).

00D91001
Explanation: A thread that was participating in a global transaction attempted to issue a Begin-UR after a decision
point (commit or abort) was already reached for the global transaction. This is violation of the protocol and is not
allowed.
System action: The Begin-UR request is failed and a SVC dump may be scheduled. The thread requesting the
Begin-UR might be abended. No resources are released because a UR is not created for the thread and no resources
may be held.
System programmer response: This is a protocol error. The application controlling the global transaction thread may
not request that a new unit of recovery be created after the global transaction has reached a decision point, either
commit or abort.
Problem determination: Obtain the UR-control log records (type '0020'x) for all the threads in the global transaction
to determine the sequence of events that led to the protocol violation. Correct the application.
00D91044
Explanation: An unexpected return code was received from RRS when setting the type of interest in a Unit of
Recovery (UR).
System action: The application is abended.
Operator response: Collect the SYS1.LOGREC and SVCDUMP, and notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: This is probably either an error in DB2 or in RRS. If you suspect an error in DB2,
you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting
data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference. If RRS has terminated, restart RRS.
Problem determination: Examine the SVCDUMP to determine the cause of the RRS failure. Register nine contains
the return code from the RRS ATRSIT request.
00D92001
Explanation: The checkpoint/restart serial controller (DSNRCRSC) FRR invoked DB2 subsystem termination,
because an unrecoverable error was detected while processing a request.
This is a DB2 subsystem termination reason code. For further information, see IRLM abend codes (IRLM).
System action: Subsystem termination is initiated. Standard DB2 diagnostic information is recorded in
SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested for the associated abend.

Problem determination: See the original error.
00D92011
Explanation: An invalid URE was found during checkpoint processing. An overlay of the URE may have occurred.
System action: The checkpoint process will ABEND to prevent a damaged URE from being written out to the log,
and the subsystem will be terminated. This is to prevent the loss or incorrect processing of a DB2 unit of recovery
(UR). DB2 Restart will use the previous checkpoint and apply all the DB2 log records up to the point of failure.
Standard DB2 diagnostic information is recorded in SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is scheduled.
Operator response: Collect the SYS1.LOGREC and SVCDUMP, and notify the system programmer. Restart DB2.

or SLIP trap exit.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Examine the SVCDUMP and the DB2 Trace Table in the dump to determine the cause of
the URE overlay.
00D92012
Explanation: An invalid RURE was found during checkpoint processing. An overlay of the RURE may have
occurred.
System action: The checkpoint process will abend to prevent a damaged RURE from being written out to the log,
and the subsystem will be terminated. This is to prevent the loss or incorrect processing of a DB2 unit of recovery.
DB2 Restart will use the previous checkpoint and apply all the DB2 log records up to the point of failure. Standard
DB2 diagnostic information is recorded in SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is scheduled.
Operator response: Collect the SYS1.LOGREC and SVCDUMP, and notify the system programmer. Restart DB2.
System programmer response: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v SVC dump (or system dump), taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, as result of an operator-initiated dump command
or SLIP trap exit.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Examine the SVCDUMP and the DB2 Trace Table in the dump to determine the cause of
the RURE overlay.
00D92013
Explanation: An invalid GXID was found during checkpoint processing. An overlay of the GXID might have
occurred.
System action: The checkpoint process will abnormally terminate to prevent a damaged GXID from being written
out to the log, and the subsystem will be terminated. This is to prevent the loss of or incorrect processing of a DB2
unit of recovery. DB2 restart will use the previous checkpoint and apply all the DB2 log records up to the point of
failure. Standard DB2 diagnostic information is recorded in SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is scheduled.
Operator response: Collect the SYS1.LOGREC and SVCDUMP, and notify the system programmer. Restart DB2.
System programmer response: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of

Problem determination: Examine the SVCDUMP and the DB2 Trace Table in the dump to determine the cause of
the GXID overlay.
00D92021
Explanation: An invalid URE was read from the log during the current status rebuild phase of restart. Restart
cannot process the damaged URE.
System action: The restart processing abends, which terminates the subsystem. This is to prevent the loss or
incorrect processing of a DB2 unit of recovery.
Standard DB2 diagnostic information is recorded in SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is scheduled. The first 4 digits
of the RBA of the invalid log record is contained in register 3 and the last 8 digits in register 4.
Operator response: Do not attempt to restart DB2 until the error is resolved. Notify the system programmer and
collect the following diagnostic items listed in
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v SVC dump (or system dump), taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, as result of an operator-initiated dump command
or SLIP trap exit.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
System programmer response: Print the BSDS using the print log map (DSNJU004) utility. Find the checkpoint
queue in the output listing from DSNJU004.
Next, run the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility to create a conditional restart record with the CHKPTRBA
option specifying the Begin checkpoint RBA found in the second entry of the checkpoint queue. Restart DB2 using
the conditional restart record found. If the same failure occurs, repeat the conditional process using the next begin
checkpoint RBA in the checkpoint queue.
Repeat this process, going down the checkpoint queue until DB2 restarts. This will be prior to the time when the
invalid URE was written to the log. The restart process is then able to apply all the log records to the end of the log.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.

Explanation: During restart, the state of a logged unit of recovery and the state of the global transaction which the
unit of recovery is part of are incompatible.
System action: The restart processing abnormally terminates, which terminates the subsystem. This is to prevent the
loss or incorrect processing of a DB2 unit of recovery.
Standard DB2 diagnostic information is recorded in SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is scheduled.
Operator response: Do not attempt to restart DB2 until the error is resolved. Notify the system programmer and

00D92025
Explanation: During restart, it was determined that at least one unit of recovery (UR) was still active at the previous
termination of this DB2 subsystem and that the subsystem was last started at a different release level.
During migration to a new release or fallback to an older release, all activity must be quiesced and there should be
no active units of recovery. DB2 restart will fail until the situation is resolved.
System action: The restart terminates abnormally, which terminates the subsystem. This action is to prevent the loss
or incorrect processing of a DB2 unit of recovery. An SVC dump is scheduled and an entry is created in
SYS1.LOGREC.
Operator response: Do not attempt to restart DB2 until the error is resolved. Notify the system programmer and
collect the required items for problem determination.
System programmer response: Because all work must be quiesced before either migration or fallback of a DB2
subsystem, the recommended action is to restart the DB2 subsystem at the release level that created the outstanding
unit or units of recovery and let the units of recovery end normally.
You might need to use the RECOVER INDOUBT command to resolve indoubt threads.
After all units of recovery have completed processing, use the STOP DB2 command with MODE(QUIESCE) to stop
DB2. Then restart DB2 at the desired release level. Using a different release level may require additional migration or
fallback actions.
If it is not possible to restart DB2 at the release level that created the outstanding units of recovery, then a cold start
is required.
1. Print the BSDS using the DSNJU004 (print log map) utility.
2. Find the highest written RBA using the output from DSNJU004.
3. Use the DSNJU003 (change log inventory) utility to create a conditional restart record, specifying the same value
for STARTRBA and ENDRBA. The RBA value must be an even multiple of 4096 (a hexadecimal value ending in 000) and should be rounded up from the highest written RBA as indicated by the DSNJU004 output.
Additional actions might be necessary to recover from possible data inconsistencies.
Another option is to restore the DB2 logs and data to a prior consistent point in time.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v SVC dump (or system dump), taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, as result of an operator-initiated dump command
or SLIP trap exit.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.

00D93001
Explanation: The commit/abort FRR (DSNRCAFR) invoked DB2 subsystem termination, because an unrecoverable
error was detected during must-complete processing for phase 2 of a commit-UR request.
This is a DB2 subsystem termination reason code. For further information, see IRLM abend codes (IRLM).
System action: Standard DB2 diagnostic information is recorded in SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested
for the original error before DB2 subsystem termination is initiated.
Operator response: Print SYS1.LOGREC, and restart DB2.
System programmer response: Obtain a copy of SYS1.LOGREC and the SVC dump for the original error.
Problem determination: See the original error.
00D93002
Explanation: The DB2 subsystem is terminated because an unrecoverable error was detected during must-complete
processing for phase 2 of a commit-UR request for an agent that is a participant in a global transaction.
This is a DB2 subsystem termination reason code. For further information, see IRLM abend codes (IRLM).
System action: Standard DB2 diagnostic information is recorded in SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested
for the original error before DB2 subsystem termination is initiated.
Operator response: Print SYS1.LOGREC, and restart DB2. Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: This is probably either an error in DB2 or in the commit of the global transaction. If
you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting
the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: DB2 records on the SYS1.LOGREC data set and requests an SVC dump. The error indicates
that there may be a problem with DB2 or with the commit coordinator of the global transaction.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00D9300F
Explanation: The commit/cancel secondary FRR invoked DB2 subsystem termination. This occurs only if functional
recovery itself fails while processing a failure during must-complete processing for phase 2 of a commit-UR request.
This is a DB2 subsystem termination reason code. For further information, see IRLM abend codes (IRLM).
System action: Standard DB2 diagnostic information is recorded in SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested
for the original error. Standard DB2 diagnostic information is also recorded in SYS1.LOGREC for the secondary error
before DB2 subsystem termination is initiated.
Operator response: Print SYS1.LOGREC, and restart DB2.
System programmer response: Obtain a copy of SYS1.LOGREC for both the original and the secondary error, and
the SVC dump for the original error.
Problem determination: See the original error.
00D93011
Explanation: A subcomponent of DB2 invoked commit when the agent state was invalid for commit-UR invocation.
Commit-UR was requested for an agent that was modifying data. Either commit-UR or abort-UR was already in
process, or the recovery structure (URE) was damaged.
System action: Abnormal termination of the agent results, including backing out (abort-UR) of its activity to the
previous point of consistency. This releases all locks held by the agent for its resources.
Standard DB2 diagnostic information is recorded in SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is scheduled. Additional
information, identified in the SDWA variable recording area by reason code '00D9CCCC', is added to the SDWA
variable recording area (VRA).
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
If the agent were in a must-complete state (in-commit2 or in-abort), the DB2 subsystem is also terminated with
reason code '00D93001'. When the subsystem is next restarted, recoverable activity for this agent (such as an
ensure-abort or ensure-commit UR) is handled to complete the commit or abort process.
System programmer response: This is a DB2 subsystem error. Collect the materials mentioned in the Problem
Determination section of this message.
Problem determination: Examine the SYS1.LOGREC data and the DB2 trace table in the dump to establish whether
either commit-UR was invoked incorrectly or the control structure that reflects the state (ACEPROG, UREPROG) was
damaged.
00D93012
Explanation: A subcomponent of DB2 invoked commit when the agent state was invalid for commit-UR invocation.
Commit-UR was invoked for an agent that was only retrieving data. Either commit-UR or abort-UR was already in
process, or the ACE progress state field was damaged.
System action: Abnormal termination of the agent results, including backing out (abort-UR) of its activity to the
previous point of consistency. This releases all locks held by the agent for its resources.
Standard DB2 diagnostic information is recorded in SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is scheduled. Additional
information, identified in the SDWA variable recording area by reason code '00D9CCCC', is added to the SDWA
variable recording area.

Problem determination: Examine the SYS1.LOGREC data and the DB2 trace table in the dump to establish whether
either commit-UR was invoked incorrectly or the control structure (ACEPROG) was damaged.
00D93013
Explanation: The request to commit an agent that was a participant in a global transaction failed because a
mismatch between the state of the agent and the state of the global transaction. State field was damaged.
System action: Abnormal termination of the agent occurs, including backing out (abort-UR) its activity to the
previous point of consistency. This releases all resource locks held by the agent.
Standard DB2 diagnostic information is recorded in SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is scheduled.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: This is probably either an error in DB2 or in the commit of the global transaction. If
you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting
the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.

Explanation: This reason code indicates that a DB2 allied agent does not need to participate in the Phase 2
(Continue Commit) call, because all required work has been accomplished during the Phase 1 (Prepare) call.
This reason code is generated by Recovery Manager when it is determined that a DB2 allied agent has not updated
any DB2 resource since its last commit processing occurred.
System action: The "yes" vote is registered with the Commit coordinator.
00D94001
Explanation: The commit/abort FRR (DSNRCAFR) invoked DB2 subsystem termination, because an unrecoverable
error was detected during must-complete processing for an abort-UR request.
This is a DB2 subsystem termination reason code.
System action: Standard DB2 diagnostic information is recorded in SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested
for the original error before DB2 subsystem termination is initiated.
Operator response: Print SYS1.LOGREC, and restart DB2.
System programmer response: Obtain a copy of SYS1.LOGREC and the SVC dump for the original error.
Problem determination: See the reason code for the original error.
00D94002
Explanation: The DB2 subsystem is terminated because an unrecoverable error was detected during must-complete
processing for an abort-UR request for an agent that is a participant in a global transaction.
This is a DB2 subsystem termination reason code.
System action: Standard DB2 diagnostic information is recorded in SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested
for the original error before DB2 subsystem termination initiates.
Operator response: Print SYS1.LOGREC, and restart DB2. Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: This is probably either an error in DB2 or in the commit of the global transaction. If
you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting
the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: DB2 records on the SYS1.LOGREC data set and requests an SVC dump. The error indicates
that there may be a problem with DB2 or with the commit coordinator of the global transaction.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).

00D9400F
Explanation: The commit/abort FRR invoked DB2 subsystem termination. This occurs only if functional recovery
itself fails while processing a failure during must-complete processing for an abort-UR request.
This is a DB2 subsystem termination reason code. For further information, see IRLM abend codes (IRLM).
System action: Standard DB2 diagnostic information is recorded in SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested
for the original error. Standard DB2 diagnostic information is also recorded in SYS1.LOGREC for the secondary error
before DB2 subsystem termination is initiated.
Operator response: Print SYS1.LOGREC, and restart DB2.
System programmer response: Obtain a copy of the SYS1.LOGREC for both the original and the secondary error,
and the SVC dump for the original error.
Problem determination: See the original error.
00D94011
Explanation: A subcomponent of DB2 invoked abort at a point when the agent state is invalid for invoking the
function that aborts units of recovery. Either abort-UR or commit-UR phase 2 was already in process, or the agent
structure was damaged.
System action: Abnormal termination of the agent results and, because the agent is in a must-complete state, the
DB2 subsystem is terminated with reason code '00D94001'. When the DB2 subsystem is restarted, recoverable activity
for this agent is handled to complete the commit or abort process.
Standard DB2 diagnostic information is recorded in SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is scheduled. Additional
information, identified in the SDWA variable recording area by reason code '00D9AAAA7', is added to the SDWA
variable recording area. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about
identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
System programmer response: This is a DB2 subsystem error. Collect the materials mentioned in the Problem
Determination section of this message.
Problem determination: Examine the SYS1.LOGREC data and the DB2 trace table in the dump to establish whether
commit-UR was invoked incorrectly or the control structure (ACEPROG, UREPROG) was damaged.
00D94012
Explanation: During rollback, the end of the log was read before all the expected log ranges were processed. The
abend is accompanied by a DB2 abnormal subsystem termination with reason code 00D94001.
System action: The agent is abnormally terminated. Because the agent is in a must-complete state, the DB2
subsystem is terminated with reason code 00D94001 and message DSNV086E. Standard DB2 diagnostic information is
recorded in SYS1.LOGREC. An 04E-D94012 SVC dump is requested.
Operator response:
1. Run the print log map (DSNJU004) utility to print the content of both BSDSs.
2. Print SYS1.LOGREC.
3. Use the MVS DISPLAY DUMP command to get the failure reason code from dump titles.
4. Notify your system programmer.
System programmer response: Obtain a copy of the SYS1.LOGREC and the SVC dump for the original error.
To restart DB2, you must take one of the following actions:
v Add the missing archive log data sets back to the BSDS with the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility and
increase the MAXARCH parameter in the DSN6LOGP member of DSNZPARM to complete the rollback, or
v Restart DB2 with a conditional restart specifying BACKOUT=NO to bypass the unit of recovery that is in-abort.
Problem determination: At the time of the abend, registers 3 and 4 contain the 6-byte relative byte address (RBA) of
the beginning of this unit of recovery. DB2 must read the log back to this point to complete the ROLLBACK of this
unit of recovery.

Explanation: An attempt to read the CHKPTRBA failed to return a valid checkpoint record. This abend is issued
after the DSNR015I error message is issued.
System action: Restart is abended.
Operator response: Inform the system programmer.
System programmer response: Let the change log inventory (DSNJU003) utility select the checkpoint RBA when
building the conditional restart record. If a specific checkpoint is desired, use DSN1LOGP to print out the checkpoint
log records within a specified range. If manual selection of the checkpoint RBA is desired, use the print log map
(DSNJU004) utility to print the checkpoint queue. Print the checkpoint queue by using the CHKPTRBA keyword.
Problem determination:
v Print the checkpoint records within the desired range using DSN1LOGP.
v Print the checkpoint queue using DSNJU004.
v Verify the checkpoint queue against the DSN1LOGP report.
v If automatic checkpoint selection was used and the checkpoint was invalid, find the valid checkpoint RBA in the
DSN1LOGP report. Use this checkpoint RBA in the CRCR using the CHKPTRBA keyword.
v If an explicit checkpoint was specified and the checkpoint was invalid, let DSNJU003 automatically choose the
checkpoint by not specifying a CHKPTRBA keyword.
00D99002
Explanation: Validation of the STARTRBA failed because either the end of the log was reached, or a bad log record
was encountered while attempting to find the first complete log record.
System action: Restart abends.
Operator response: Inform the system programmer.
System programmer response: Check the console log for DSNJ (Log Manager) messages; these may indicate failures
in the Log Manager processing, or may reveal additional useful information for diagnostic purposes. Use DSN1LOGP
to find a safe STARTRBA to use for restart. If a STARTRBA is specified, the Recovery Manager will use it as a
starting point. From the starting point, the Recovery Manager will attempt to find the beginning of a valid log record.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Contents of the BSDS (both copies if dual BSDS in use) obtained by using the DB2 print log map (DSNJU004)
utility.
00D99003
Explanation: CSRONLY was specified in the conditional restart record. Only the DB2 status phase of restart will

transaction and the global transaction is going to be backed out.
System action: The unit of recovery is not committed.
User response: The application must roll back to the previous COMMIT.
00D9AAAA
Explanation: This reason code identifies additional data stored in the SDWA variable recording area following a
failure during abort-UR.
This reason code appears only in the SDWA variable recording area (VRA) and serves only to identify data (in
addition to the standard DB2 diagnostic information that is stored in the SDWA). This reason code is the first data
item of the standard information. As such, it always appears in the VRA of an SDWA for a primary error
completion/reason code. If no data is added, the reason code in the SDWA VRA is the same as that associated with
the completion code.
System action: Five bytes of data preceded by code VRAHEX are stored following the EBCDIC string
'RMC-COMMIT/ABORT'.
Length Data
1 byte Retry flags
1 byte Retry id
1 byte Notification RMID
2 bytes ACE progress state (ACEPROG)
System programmer response: Use this information in conjunction with other information for the primary failure. If
you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting
the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.

Explanation: An attempt was made to use the Internal Resource Lock Manager (IRLM) facilities, but the IRLM was
not available. Either the IRLM had not been started by the operator, or the IRLM has encountered a problem causing
it to terminate abnormally.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested. The requesting execution unit
is abended.
Operator response: The IRLM should be started before the DB2 subsystem is started. If this does not resolve the
problem (that is, if the IRLM actually was started before DB2 was started) notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: This is probably not a DB2 problem. Obtain a copy of SYS1.LOGREC and the SVC
dump.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: If IRLM abended, and if you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the
problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2
Diagnosis Guide and Reference. Otherwise, ensure that the IRLM is started before the -START DB2 command is
issued.

00E30071
Explanation: Either DB2 terminated without successfully signing off from IRLM, or another subsystem with the
same SSNAME is still connected. This abend reason code accompanies message DSNT380I.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested. DB2 is abended.
Operator response: Determine if another DB2 subsystem is active. If another subsystem is not active, and IMS is not
sharing the same IRLM, cancel IRLM prior to starting DB2. Regardless, notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Obtain a copy of SYS1.LOGREC and the SVC dump. If you suspect an error in DB2,
you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting
data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
If the error was caused by a previously unsuccessful QUIT from the IRLM, manually stop IRLM. If IMS is using the
same IRLM, refer to the IMS documentation to determine the effect of IRLM terminating while IMS is connected.
If you are running multiple versions of DB2, ensure that the SSNAME specified by the DSN6SPRM macro during the
installation of the member DSNZPARM is not the same as the SSNAME in another version of DB2.
Problem determination: A previously unsuccessful sign-off from the IRLM is documented by an abend of
X'00E30075' during the previous termination of DB2.

whose address is found in register 8, and by the Display Command subcode in register 2.
00E30078
Explanation: IRLM called the service controller IRLM interface status exit with register 0 equal to 1 in order to
notify DB2 that IRLM is terminating. This is not a DB2 subsystem error.
System action: DB2 is abended when IRLM is terminated before DB2 is terminated. An entry is written to
SYS1.LOGREC.
00E30079
Explanation: An error was encountered on return from the Internal Resource Lock Manager (IRLM) IDENTIFY
function.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested. DB2 is abended.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: This may be an internal DB2 error or an operator procedure problem. Obtain a copy
of SYS1.LOGREC and the SVC dump. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: In the SVC dump, register 2 contains the return code and register 3 contains the reason
code from the identify function to the IRLM. Examine the reason code in register 3, either from the dump or system
console log. A reason code of X'4004' indicates that the identify function code (51, X'33') does not exist in the IRLM
SSVT. This may be due to the operator issuing a stop IRLM command followed by a start DB2 command before the
IRLM has completed termination processing. The sequence of commands can be determined from the system console
log.
A reason code of X'4008' indicates that the IRLM is unavailable, that is, IRLM is not started and the autostart is not
requested by parameters in DSNZPARM.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.

can be determined by analyzing the CSECT involved in the abend. The name of this CSECT is found in both the
SYS1.LOGREC and the SVC dump.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v SVC dump (or system dump), taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, as result of an operator-initiated dump command
or SLIP trap exit.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.

Explanation: DB2 is unable to acquire a modify lock because of an incompatible retained lock held by one or more
other DB2 subsystems in the DB2 data sharing group. Retained locks are locks that persist across DB2 abnormal
terminations.
System action: SQLCODE -904 is returned to the user. This reason code and the resource name are also returned.
System programmer response: Use the DISPLAY DATABASE command to display the DB2 member names owning
the retained locks. You must restart those subsystems to remove the 'resource unavailable' condition.
Problem determination:
00E30096
Explanation: DB2 is unable to acquire a modify lock. Lock negotiation failed because this request was involved in
lock negotiation with other DB2 subsystems and the request was denied.
System action: A 'resource unavailable' condition is returned to the user. This reason code, the resource type, and
the resource name are also returned.
System programmer response: Determine why the lock request failed. One possible cause of the lock request failure
is if another DB2 subsystem in the DB2 data sharing group is abnormally terminating.
User response: Resubmit the request.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
00E30097
Explanation: DB2 encountered an IRLM error indicating that IRLM detected an 'out of record list' storage condition.
The record list is a part of the coupling facility lock structured that contains the 'modify locks' (those locks that
would be retained in case of a failure).
System action: DSNT500I or SQLCODE -904 is returned to the user. This reason code and the resource name are
also returned.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: The coupling facility lock structure is declared too small. If this condition becomes a
prevalent problem, you need to redistribute the coupling facility lock structure storage resource to make more room
for the record list. You can make room for the record list in on of two ways:
v Issue a rebuild.
v Dynamically change the lock structure size.
Refer to DB2 Data Sharing: Planning and Administration for more details about these options.
00E30099
Explanation: A conversion error occurred during DB2 startup. This conversion is used to determine if conversion
services are set up correctly.
System action: DB2 terminates.
User response: See message DSNT552I to resolve the problem.
00E3009A
Explanation: During DB2 startup, DB2 detected a difference between the CCSIDs recorded in the BSDS and the
CCSIDs specified by the version of DSNHDECP module or user-supplied application defaults module that that was
loaded during startup. DB2 startup terminated to avoid potential data corruption issues. Message DSNT108I is
generated before the abend occurs.
System action: Subsystem startup is terminated.
Operator response: See message DSNT108I.
System programmer response: Determine the reason for the termination of DB2 startup. See message DSNT108I.
Problem determination: See message DSNT108I.
00E3009B
Explanation: DB2 detected an invalid CCSID specification during startup. DB2 startup has terminated to avoid
potential data corruption issues. Message DSNT109I is generated before the abend occurs.
System action: Subsystem startup is terminated.
Operator response: See message DSNT109I.
System programmer response: Determine the reason for the termination of DB2 startup. See message DSNT109I.
Problem determination: See message DSNT109I.
00E3009E
Explanation: The plan depends on new facilities of the release from which fall back has occurred.
System action: The allocation for the user failed.
System programmer response: Warn the user community NOT to run this plan until you have remigrated to the
newer release.
User response: Do not use this plan until your DB2 subsystem is remigrated to the newer release.
00E30100
Explanation: This reason code can be returned in the following cases:
v A parallel task running on a DB2 terminates abnormally.
v An assisting DB2 terminates abnormally.
System action: The member name where the failure occurred is returned to the application as the resource name in
SQLCODE -904. In a non-data-sharing environment, the member name is blank, and the failure occurs on the local
DB2.
Operator response: Enter DISPLAY GROUP from an active DB2 to see if a DB2 subsystem is down. Restart the
failed DB2 subsystem.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00E30101
Explanation: The result of issuing a SETFRR macro indicates that this FRR is not the top FRR.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC. An SVC dump is requested.
System programmer response: This is probably a DB2 internal error. Obtain a copy of SYS1.LOGREC and the SVC
dump. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00E30104
Explanation: This reason code is used by the service controller (SC) subcomponent to respond NO on a
prepare-to-commit notification.
System action: If the service controller indicates that DB2 cannot commit to perform the work requested by the
application since the last commit point, it responds NO on the prepare-to-commit notification (COMMIT1). This
forces the commit to be changed to an abort, causing the work performed by the application since the last commit
point to be backed out.
00E30105
Explanation: IRLM was informed of a link failure to a coupling facility that contains a lock table being actively used
by this data sharing group.
System action: The DB2 subsystem is terminated with this reason code.
System programmer response: See IRLM message DXRxxxE to determine the root cause of the failure and the
appropriate corrective action.
Problem determination:
00E30301
Explanation: You have attempted to execute a plan that does not exist. This reason code is used by the automatic
BIND function to indicate that no record exists in SYSIBM.SYSPLAN for the plan-ID you are attempting to run, so
plan allocation fails.
System action: The plan is not executed.
User response: Determine if the object name was correctly specified. If so, ensure that the plan exists (by selecting
from SYSIBM.SYSPLAN).
00E30302
Explanation: This reason code is used by the automatic BIND function to indicate that the plan currently being
allocated is not operational. The automatic BIND for the plan failed because the plan was dependent on something
that was altered or dropped. An unavailable database might also cause this problem.
System action: The autobind fails, and the plan cannot be allocated.
System programmer response: Determine what made the plan not operational. Make sure the required database is
available. Issue a REBIND subcommand for the plan.
00E30303
Explanation: You have attempted to execute a package that does not exist. This reason code is used by the
automatic package BIND function to indicate that no record exists in SYSIBM.SYSPACKAGE for the package-ID you
are attempting to run, so package allocation fails.
System action: Package allocation fails.
User response: Determine if the object name was correctly specified. If so, ensure that the package exists (by
selecting from SYSIBM.SYSPACKAGE).
00E30305
Explanation: This reason code is used by the automatic binding function to indicate that the package that is
currently being allocated is not operational.
If a package becomes invalid, the VALID column in the SYSIBM.SYSPACKAGE table is set to a value other than Y.
The next time that the package is allocated, automatic rebinding is triggered.
If automatic rebinding is successful, then the package becomes valid again. (The value in the VALID column is
changed to Y.) If the rebinding is not successful, then the package remains invalid and becomes inoperative. (The
value in the VALID column stays the same and the value of the OPERATIVE column is changed to N.) The allocation
fails, and this code is issued.
System action: Agent allocation fails or DROP package fails.
System programmer response: Determine what made the package not operational, and issue a REBIND
subcommand for the package.

00E30306
Explanation: This reason code is returned when the automatic bind for plan is disabled. The automatic bind is
disabled through the installation process.
System action: The plan is not automatically bound.
System programmer response: Rebind the plan prior to execution.

Explanation: A warning occurred because the length of time that a thread was idle exceeded the warning setting for
the MONITOR IDLE THREADS keyword in a monitor profile for one of the following filtering scopes:
v LOCATION
v PRDID
v ROLE_AUTHID
v ROLE
v AUTHID
v COLLID_PKGNAME
v COLLID
v PKGNAME
v CLIENT_APPLNAME
v CLIENT_USERID
v CLIENT_WRKSTNNAME
The server thread was holding DB2 resources and the requesting application did not make a request to the DB2
server thread for an extended period of time.
System action: A warning alert is issued, but the processing continues normally.
DB2 issues message DSNT771I.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Review the information provided in message DSNT771I. Determine why the
requesting application did not make a request to the DB2 server in the specified time.
If the application requires additional time:
1. Modify the MONITOR IDLE THREADS warning threshold in the SYSIBM.DSN_PROFILE_ATTRIBUTES table.
2. Issue the START PROFILE command to refresh the warning threshold value.

Explanation: A thread was canceled because the length of time that a thread was idle exceeded the exception setting
for the MONITOR IDLE THREADS keyword in a monitor profile for one of the following filtering scopes:
v LOCATION
v PRDID
v ROLE_AUTHID
v ROLE
v AUTHID
v COLLID_PKGNAME
v COLLID
v PKGNAME
v CLIENT_APPLNAME
v CLIENT_USERID

The server thread was holding DB2 resources and the requesting application did not make a request to the DB2
server thread for an extended period of time.
System action: DB2 abnormally terminates the execution unit, terminates the server thread to release resources that
might affect other threads, and issues message DSNT772I.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Review the information provided in message DSNT772I. Determine why the
requesting application did not make a request to the DB2 server in the specified time.
This condition typically occurs for one of the following reasons:
v The ACTIVE thread option was specified in the DDF THREADS field of the DSNTIPR installation panel, and a
requester application or its user did not make a request to the DB2 server for an extended period (such as a
lengthy user absence). As a result, the server thread becomes susceptible to cancellation because of the timeout
value.
Action: Determine why the requesting application did not make a request to the DB2 server in the specified time.
v The INACTIVE thread option was specified in the DDF THREADS field of the DSNTIPR installation panel, and a
requester application or its user failed to commit before an extended dormant period (such as user absence). It is
also possible that, despite committing before an extended dormant period, database resources are still held because
of other existing conditions. As a result, the server thread cannot be moved to the inactive state and becomes
susceptible to being canceled because of the timeout value.
Action: Determine why the server thread was not moved to the inactive state.
If the application requires additional time:
1. Modify the MONITOR IDLE THREADS exception threshold in the SYSIBM.DSN_PROFILE_ATTRIBUTES table.
2. Issue the START PROFILE command to refresh the exception threshold value.

Explanation: DB2 was unable to service the connection request because the number of concurrent active threads
exceeded the exception threshold for the MONITOR THREADS keyword in a monitor profile for the LOCATION
filtering scope.
System action: When the MONITOR THREADS exception threshold value is set to zero, the connection is
terminated.
Otherwise, the connection remains active and the thread is queued until other threads deallocate or go inactive,
providing an available slot. The thread resumes when a slot becomes available and the number of the concurrent
active threads goes below the profile exception threshold, unless another thread is next in the queue.
In both cases, DB2 issues message DSNT772I.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.

Explanation: A resource limit as determined from the active resource limit specification table has been exceeded.
The SQL statement has been terminated with an SQLCODE -905.
System action: The current SQL statement contains an SQLCODE -905.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: An SQL statement used too much resource space. If you suspect an error in DB2,
you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting
data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.

Explanation: An attempt was made to identify to an IRLM that does not support the level of function DB2 needs.
Message DSNT803I accompanies this abend reason code.
System action: Message DSNT803I is issued to the console, and DB2 terminates abnormally with this reason code. A
record is written to SYS1.LOGREC. No SVC dump is taken.
System programmer response: Ensure that the statement in your IRLM startup procedure is referencing the correct
IRLM code library and that IRLM is at the appropriate level of maintenance
00E30802
Explanation: DB2 was not able to identify to IRLM because another subsystem already identified to IRLM. Message
DSNT811E accompanies this abend reason code.
System action: Message DSNT811E is issued to the console. DB2 terminates abnormally with this reason code. A
record is written to SYS1.LOGREC. No SVC dump is taken.
System programmer response: IRLM Version 2.1 enforces a one to one (1:1) mapping between IRLM and DB2.
Multiple DBMS subsystems can no longer use the same IRLM. Ensure that:
v Each DB2 subsystem is associated with its own IRLM subsystem.
v The correct IRLM procedure name and subsystem name are specified in the DB2 system parameters.
Problem determination:
00E30803
Explanation: An error occurred in one of the DB2-supplied exits to IRLM. This abend reason code is issued only in
a DB2 sharing data environment and indicates an internal error in DB2 or IRLM.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC and an SVC dump is initiated. DB2 terminates abnormally.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
00E30805
Explanation: DB2 could not activate one of the exits used with IRLM for data sharing. This is a DB2 internal error.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC and an SVC dump is initiated. DB2 terminates abnormally.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and

00E30806
Explanation: IRLM could not successfully join its IRLM data sharing group. Message DSNT800I accompanies this
abend reason code.
System action: Message DSNT800I is issued to the console, and DB2 abnormally terminates with this reason code. A
record is written to SYS1.LOGREC. No SVC dump is taken.
System programmer response: Some possible reasons why IRLM could not join its data sharing group are:
v The lock structure is not properly defined in the active MVS CFRM administrative policy. The lock structure name
is a concatenation of the DB2 data sharing group name and the string 'LOCK1', separated by an underscore (_). For
example, if the DB2 data sharing group name is DSNCAT, DSNCAT_LOCK1 would be the lock structure name.
Ensure that the lock structure is properly defined in the active MVS CFRM policy. The name of the lock structure
that IRLM attempted to access is given in message DSNT800I. IRLM issues message DXR138E to indicate that the
lock structure definition could not be accessed in the active MVS CFRM policy.
v IRLM could not connect the lock structure. The reason for the connect failure is given in IRLM message DXR135E.
v IRLM could not join its data sharing group. The reason for the join failure is given in IRLM message DXR134E.
v IRLM joined the wrong group. The set of IRLMs that are connected to a given lock structure must all be members
of the same group.
Ensure that the GROUP parameter is correctly specified in the IRLM startup procedure. If you give an incorrect
group name, IRLM connects the lock structure, and then times out waiting for responses from other connectors.
IRLM issues message DXR133I for the timeout.
Problem determination:
00E30807
Explanation: DB2 failed on the IRLM Identify request because no lock structure name was specified. Message
DSNT810E accompanies this abend reason code.
System action: Message DSNT810E is issued to the console, and DB2 terminates abnormally with this reason code.
A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC. No SVC dump is taken.
System programmer response: This condition occurs if you are not running DB2 in data sharing mode, but the
associated IRLM is running with global scope (SCOPE=GLOBAL in the IRLM startup procedure). If you are not
running DB2 in data sharing mode, ensure that the associated IRLM startup procedure specifies SCOPE=LOCAL.
Conversely, if you are running DB2 in data sharing mode, ensure that the associated IRLM startup procedure
specifies SCOPE=GLOBAL.
Problem determination:
00E30808
Explanation: DB2 issued an IRLM PURGE request to purge retained locks, but the PURGE request was not
successful. This abend reason code accompanies message DSNT807I.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC and an SVC dump is initiated. The DB2 restart process is
terminated.
System programmer response: The IRLM return and reason codes are in the SYS1.LOGREC record.
Problem determination:
00E30809
Explanation: DB2 failed on the IRLM Identify request because IRLM did not return the lock structure version ID.
Message DSNT809I accompanies this abend reason code.
System action: Message DSNT809I is issued to the console, and DB2 abnormally terminates with this reason code. A
record is written to SYS1.LOGREC. No SVC dump is taken.
System programmer response: This condition occurs if you are running DB2 in data sharing mode, but the
associated IRLM is running with local scope (SCOPE=LOCAL in the IRLM startup procedure). If you are running
DB2 in data sharing mode, ensure that the associated IRLM startup procedure specifies SCOPE=GLOBAL.
Conversely, if you are not running DB2 in data sharing mode, ensure that the associated IRLM startup procedure
specifies SCOPE=LOCAL.
Problem determination:
00E40000
Explanation: A function of DB2 was invoked and attempted to establish a functional recovery environment. The
functional recovery element (FRE) that was created was not the first one.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested. The execution unit is abended.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: This is a DB2 internal error. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the
problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2
Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of

00E40005
Explanation: A nonzero reason code was returned from MVS sort.
System action: Any error message generated by sort in conjunction with the nonzero reason code is directed to the
device/data set identified by the UTPRINT DD statement in the utility job step.
Error message DSNU044I, that contains the nonzero reason code, is directed to the device/data set identified by the
SYSPRINT DD statement in the utility job step.
Operator response: An operator with SYSOPR authority can issue the -TERM UTILITY command to release the
resources claimed by the stopped utility (this may not be necessary).
User response: Determine the cause of the error. If the error can be corrected, the utility may be restarted from the
beginning of the sort phase by using the 'RESTART(PHASE)' parameter. If the error prevents the utility from
completing, the -TERM command should be issued to remove the stopped utility from the system. The -TERM
UTILITY should seldom be used when the stopped utility is REORG.
Problem determination: This abend is accompanied by the utility message DSNU044I, that contains the sort reason
code and an SVC dump. In most cases, the error messages from SORT that are sent to the device/data set identified
by the UTPRINT DD statement identify the problem. The dump may not be needed. If SORT is unable to open the
UTPRINT data set, only the message and abend are provided. In this case, correct the problem associated with the
UTPRINT DD statement, and restart the job with the RESTART(PHASE) option.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v SYSPRINT output, including JCL, for the application program or batch job, and system messages that were issued.

environment.
00E40006
Explanation: An error was detected while manipulating the utility-in-progress bits of the database exception table
(DBET). The error might occur due to one of the following conditions:
v The SYSIBM.SYSUTIL table and the DBET are out of sync.
v The utility-in-progress condition was not properly reset after execution of a prior utility.
v A resource unavailable condition exists.
System action: Utility processing is abended. This abend might be accompanied by message DSNT500I. An SDUMP
might be requested.
System programmer response: Use the -DISPLAY UTILITY command to display the status of any utilities in
progress. Determine if another utility is active on the same table space. Use the -DISPLAY DATABASE command to
determine if the table space has a utility-in-progress condition set on.
The utility-in-progress bit is turned on only for table spaces. If a utility is run against an index, the utility-in-progress
bit is turned on for the appropriate table space.
A utility-in-progress condition set without a corresponding entry for an active or stopped utility in the SYSUTIL table
is an inconsistent condition caused by a prior error. To resolve this, issue a -START DATABASE command specifying
the proper table space with the ACCESS(FORCE) parameter. This causes the utility-in-progress status to be cleared.
If the problem cannot be corrected, determine the failing environment.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: If applicable, correct the resource unavailable condition identified by the DSNT500I message. For an
explanation of resource types, see . Either restart the utility from the last commit point or terminate the utility and
submit it again.
If DSNT500I was not issued, register 2 contains a secondary DB2 reason code that gives more information about the
problem. If the secondary reason code is not documented in this manual, it is an internal IBM code. Consult the
system programmer to diagnose the problem.
Problem determination: If the condition cannot be corrected, determine the failing environment.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v SYSPRINT output, including JCL, for the application program or batch job, and system messages that were issued.
Make sure that MSGLEVEL=(1,1) on the JOB statement so that all diagnostic information is sent to SYSPRINT.
v UTPRINT output, produced by utility invocation of SORT.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (for 04E and 04F abends). Availability of this dump is
dependent on the failing environment.
v SYSABEND, SYSUDUMP, or SYSMDUMP output. Availability of these dumps is dependent on the failing
environment.
v Copy of the log for this period, so that additional DSN1LOGP reports can be produced for problem determination.
00E40007
Explanation: The COPY utility function is unable to open the table space as directed. The failure can occur because
the table space is currently not available. The failure can also be an internal error.
System action: If the table space is currently not available, a DSNT500I RESOURCE UNAVAILABLE message is
directed to the device or data set identified by the SYSPRINT DD statement. The utility job step is placed in the
stopped state.
Operator response: After the environmental information is determined, an operator with SYSOPR authority can
terminate the utility job step and free the resources, but this might not be necessary.
System programmer response: If a DSNT500I message preceded the abend, use the contents of that message for
problem determination. Otherwise, determine the failing environment.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: If the abend was accompanied by a DSNT500I message, use that message to determine the cause of
the resource unavailability. You can restart the utility when the resource becomes available, or you can terminate the
utility job step and resubmit the job at a later time.
If a DSNT500I message was not issued, an internal processing error occurred. Provide the system programmer with
dumps and messages for fault analysis.
Problem determination: This is an internal error.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v SYSPRINT output, including JCL, for the application program or batch job, and system messages that were issued.
Make sure that MSGLEVEL=(1,1) on the JOB statement so that all diagnostic information is sent to SYSPRINT.
v UTPRINT output, produced by utility invocation of SORT.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (for 04E and 04F abends). Availability of this dump is
dependent on the failing environment.
v SYSABEND, SYSUDUMP, or SYSMDUMP output. Availability of these dumps is dependent on the failing
environment.

Explanation: A DB2 utility has attempted to allocate a data set to the generic unit name SYSALLDA, but the
allocation has failed. This dynamic allocation was attempted because the utility had been requested to perform sorts
in parallel, a DFSPARM data set was present in the job JCL, the DFSPARM data set was allocated to SYSIN, and no
SORTDEVT specification was supplied in the utility control statement.
System action: Utility processing is abended.
User response: If the failing utility was REORG, and the UNLOAD phase had completed, restart the utility after
taking one of the following actions:
v Delete the DFSPARM data set from the job JCL.
v Create a DASD data set containing the DFSORT control statements you want to use and change the job JCL to
point to that data set instead of SYSIN.
If the failing utility was not REORG, or if it was REORG and the UNLOAD phase had not completed, use the -TERM
command to terminate the utility. Then resubmit the job after taking one of the following actions:
v Delete the DFSPARM data set from the job JCL.
v Create a DASD data set containing the DFSORT control statements you want to use and change the job JCL to
point to that data set instead of SYSIN.
v Use the SORTDEVT keyword in the utility control statement to specify a generic device unit name (such as
SYSDA) that can be used to do the dynamic allocation.

00E40071
Explanation: An I/O error was encountered on a required OS/VS data set. An abend was issued to place the utility
in a stopped state for review and correction. Resubmit the utility.
This abend might also be issued by a utility that uses subtasks, if one subtask encounters an abend B37, D37, or E37
on a data set, and another subtask tries to write to the data set.
System action: One of two utility error messages (DSNU032E or DSNU040I) is sent to the data set or device
associated with the SYSPRINT DD statement of the utility job step. The error message identifies the error and the
data set in error.
If the abend is issued by utility subtasks, DSNU016I is issued instead of DSNU032E or DSNU040I.
The utility is stopped at the beginning of the phase that used the OS/VS data set.
Operator response: An operator with SYSOPR authority can terminate the utility and release any held resources
(this might not be necessary).
User response: If the utility message was DSNU032E, the job can be restarted if an undamaged output data set is
provided. Obtain an undamaged output data set, and restart the utility job step with the RESTART(PHASE) option.
The job cannot be restarted if an unload data set, during the RELOAD phase of either the LOAD or REORG, is used
as input instead of output.
If the utility message was DSNU040I, determine the problem as described in Problem Determination. Then either
resubmit the utility job using the RESTART option, or terminate the utility job step.
If the utility message was DSNU016I, determine the cause of the B37, D37, or E37 abend and take the appropriate
action. Normally, you will need to either allocate more storage for the data set, or change the allocation to a volume
that has more space available.
Problem determination: Problem determination depends upon which error message was directed to the data
set/device identified by the SYSPRINT DD statement.
If DSNU032E was issued, an I/O error was encountered on a required utility work data set. The message describes
the error and the data set in error.
If DSNU040I was issued, an error has occurred during BSAM access to the data set defined by the DD statement
specified in the message. The DECB provided as a hexadecimal string contains the ECB in the first four bytes. The
first byte of the ECB contains status bits that indicate the cause of the error.
There might be an IOS (I/O subsystem) message on the MVS console SYSLOG indicating the type of I/O error that
occurred. If an IOS message was issued, follow the problem determination directions for the message. Refer to the
appropriate MVS publication for the meaning of the status bits.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v SYSPRINT output, including JCL, for the application program or batch job, and system messages that were issued.
Make sure that MSGLEVEL=(1,1) on the JOB statement so that all diagnostic information is sent to SYSPRINT.
v UTPRINT output, produced by utility invocation of SORT.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (for 04E and 04F abends). Availability of this dump is
dependent on the failing environment.

Explanation: An error was encountered while processing a BSAM data set.
System action: A message identifying the error might have been sent to the data set/device associated with the
SYSPRINT DD statement of the utility job step. If no prior message was produced, a dump was requested. The utility
job step that caused the function to be requested is abended. The utility job is placed in the stopped state.
Operator response: Notify the user or system programmer.
System programmer response: Review the job output and failing environment. If a message was produced to
identify the error, correct the error and resubmit or restart the job. If no message was produced, then a dump should
have been requested. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about
identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: If a message was produced to identify the error, refer to that message description for the proper
action. If no message can be found, then notify the system programmer.

Explanation: The DYNALLOC SVC returned an unexpected return code when attempting to deallocate a data set.
System action: Processing is halted.
Operator response: If necessary, an operator with SYSOPR authority can issue the -TERM UTILITY command to
release the resources claimed by the stopped utility.
System programmer response: This error may occur for a data set allocated by a JCL DD card or by a TEMPLATE
utility control statement. If the problem determination indicates an error in the way the data set was specified, fix the
JCL DD card or the TEMPLATE control statement and resubmit the job. If a problem is indicated in the I/O
subsystem, then correct the problem before resubmitting the job.
User response: If the problem persists, then notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: The abend code is accompanied by message DSNU031I which provides the data set name,
return code and reason code values returned from the dynamic allocation request. Refer to MVS/ESA Programming:
Authorized Assembler Services Guide for a complete description of the possible return and reason codes from
DYNALLOC. Error messages in the job log might give more information about the problem. Analyze these messages
to determine the source of the error and the actions required to correct the error.
00E40079
Explanation: A utility work data set has a block size that is too small to accommodate the data to be written. An
abend is issued to place the utility job step in a stopped state. This allows the error to be reviewed and corrected,
and the job step to be resubmitted.
System action: Utility error message DSNU038I is directed to the device/data set identified by the SYSPRINT DD
statement. The utility job step is placed in the stopped state.
User response: Delete the data set in error. Change the JCL so that the block size for the data set with the ddname
nominated in error message DSNU038I is at least the indicated block size. Resubmit the utility job step with
RESTART(PHASE) option.
Problem determination: Utility error message DSNU038I is directed to the device/data set identified by the
SYSPRINT DD statement. It gives the name of DD statement that defines the data set with the inadequate block size
and gives the minimum block size in bytes.

Operator response: If necessary, an operator with SYSOPR authority can issue the -TERM UTILITY command to
release the resources claimed by the stopped utility.
System programmer response: Determine the failing environment. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need
to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting
data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items: listed in
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v SYSABEND, SYSUDUMP, or SYSMDUMP output.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v SYSPRINT output, including JCL, for the application program or batch job, and system messages that were issued.

Explanation: A LOAD or REORG utility detected an index that was potentially in a physically inconsistent state,
which prohibited the LOAD or REORG utility from completing its processing for that index.
System action: The utility job is abended. No SYSABEND dump or SVC dump is requested.
User response: If the abend occurred during REORG utility processing, all indexes that were not built must be
rebuilt using the DB2 Rebuild Index utility. To determine which indexes did not complete processing, use the DB2
-DISPLAY DATABASE command with the SPACENAM and RESTRICT options. Indexes that have not completed
processing are in a 'RBDP' (rebuild pending) or 'PSRBD' (page set rebuild pending) state. Terminate the failed
REORG utility using the DB2 -TERM UTIL command. Submit a job to rebuild the inconsistent indexes using the DB2
REBUILD or RECOVER Index utility.
If the abend occurred during LOAD utility processing, the data might need to be rebuilt if one or more of the
indexes not built is unique. In that case, rebuilding the indexes without first rebuilding the data could cause error
messages for duplicate keys to be issued during the REBUILD utility processing.
Problem determination: Message DSNU548I is issued before this abend and specifies which index was in a 'PSRDB'
(page set rebuild pending) state. The LOAD or REORG utility could not process an index in such a state and
abnormally terminated. 'PSRDB' is set for secondary indexes of a partitioned table space and indicates that the index
might be physically inconsistent. This occurs when a DB2 utility physically alters such an index during utility
processing (that is, during the build process for that index). If the utility is unable to complete that process, the index
is left in the 'PSRDB' state and must be rebuilt before DB2 can use it.

Explanation: In REORG with SHRLEVEL CHANGE, during processing of the log, a log record is inconsistent with
the table that maps between old and new RIDs. Specifically, one of these is true:
v The log record implies that before an update, the data record was a pointer data record, but the mapping table
implies that the data record was a regular or overflow data record.
v The log record implies that before an update, the data record was a regular or overflow data record, but the
mapping table implies that the data record was a pointer data record.
System action: The utility job step that caused the function to be requested abends. The utility job is placed in the
stopped state.
System programmer response: This is an internal error. Determine the failing environment. If you suspect an error
in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see
Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of

00E4030F
Explanation: After the last iteration of log processing, one or more index keys in the shadow copy are not unique.
REORG with SHRLEVEL CHANGE operates as follows:
1. Unloads data from the original copy of the area (table space or partition) being reorganized
2. Reloads into a shadow copy of that area
3. Iteratively applies the log (which records applications' writing of the original copy) to the shadow copy so that
the shadow copy and the original copy contain the same data
If the table space has any unique indexes, those indexes will enforce uniqueness of the relevant index keys in the
original copy. Those index keys should also be unique in the shadow copy.
System action: The utility job step that caused the function to be requested abends. The utility job is placed in the
stopped state.

00E4031B
Explanation: For the area (table space or partition) being reorganized, REORG with SHRLEVEL REFERENCE or
CHANGE unloads data from the original data sets and reloads data into shadow data sets. REORG then exchanges
the names of the original and shadow data sets, using temporary names during the renaming.
The original name of a data set is in the form catname.DSNDBx.dbname.psname. I0001.Annn. The shadow name of a
data set is in the form catname.DSNDBx.dbname.psname. S0001.Annn. The temporary name of a data set is in the form
catname.DSNDBx.dbname.psname. T0001.Annn. REORG uses such data sets for indexes as well as data.
To exchange the names of the original and shadow data sets, REORG performs the following renaming:
1 In the switch phase, it renames the original data set from the original name to the temporary name
2 In the switch phase, it renames the shadow data set from the shadow name to the original name
3 In the utilterm phase, it renames the original data set from the temporary name to the shadow name (for
user-managed data sets). It deletes the temporary for DB2-managed data sets.
This abend code means that during the switch phase of REORG, one of these errors was detected:
1 On rename 1, a data set with a temporary name already exists.
2 On rename 2, a data set with an original name already exists.
These error conditions can arise for a DB2-managed or user-managed data set.
Message DSNU360I also appears, with the name of the data set and with a context code of 1, or 2.
System action: The utility job step that caused the function to be requested abends. The utility job is placed in the
stopped state.
User response: Take one of the following actions:
v Delete the data set and then restart the utility.
v TERM the utility. Delete the data set before trying to execute REORG again with SHRLEVEL REFERENCE or
CHANGE.

Explanation: For the area (table space or partition) being reorganized, REORG with SHRLEVEL REFERENCE or
CHANGE unloads data from the original data sets and reloads data into shadow data sets. REORG then exchanges
the names of the original and shadow data sets, using temporary names during the renaming.
The original name of a data set is in the form catname.DSNDBx.dbname.psname. I0001.Annn. The shadow name of a
data set is in the form catname.DSNDBx.dbname.psname. S0001.Annn. The temporary name of a data set is in the form
catname.DSNDBx.dbname.psname. T0001.Annn. REORG uses such data sets for indexes as well as data.
To exchange the names of the original and shadow data sets, REORG performs the following renaming:
1 In the switch phase, it renames the original data set from the original name to the temporary name
2 In the switch phase, it renames the shadow data set from the shadow name to the original name
3 In the utilterm phase, it renames the original data set from the temporary name to the shadow name (for
user-managed data sets). It deletes the temporary for DB2-managed data sets.
If a -TERM UTILITY is issued after any renaming, the -TERM UTILITY undoes the renaming that the REORG
performed by renaming:
4 The original data set from the shadow name to the temporary name
5 The shadow data set from the original name to the shadow name
6 The original data set from the temporary name to the original name
During REORG, or during -TERM UTILITY, an attempt to rename a data set failed due to a system problem. This
error condition can arise for a DB2-managed or user-managed data set.
Message DSNP027I also appears, with the old and new names of the data set and with other information.
System action: The job step that caused the function to be requested abends. The utility job or the -TERM UTILITY
command is placed in the stopped state.
System programmer response: This is an internal error. Determine the failing environment. If you suspect an error
in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see
Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
User response: If this condition arises during renaming 1, 2, or 3, and you can correct the problem. Choose between
these actions:
v Correct the problem and then RESTART the utility.
v TERM the utility.
If this condition arises during renaming 1, 2, or 3, and you cannot correct the problem, TERM the utility and notify
the system programmer.
If this condition arises during renaming 4, 5, or 6, notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of

Explanation: An error was detected during the execution of a restarted utility. A message is issued prior to this
abend code to indicate the type of error.
System action: Utility processing is abended.
User response: Check messages issued prior to this abend code to determine the cause of the error. Correct the

Explanation: When the utility performs dynamic allocation of sort data sets, the total number of data sets in each
sort group must be less than 255. This reason code might be issued after message DSNU3341I.
System action: Utility processing abends.
System programmer response: Provide more disk space for sort work data sets by either adding volumes to the sort
pool or by defragmenting the existing sort volumes. Then resubmit the job.
Problem determination: Sort work data sets are allocated in primary quantities only, so this error occurs when the
sort volumes are very fragmented or are used to their full capacity.
Verify the number of free tracks and the size of the largest contiguous block of tracks on your sort volumes to see
whether more volumes need to be added to the sort pool or if defragmentation is necessary. Defragmentation might
be required if many tracks are still available on each volume but the largest contiguous block is very small.

Explanation: A DB2 execution unit has been abended. This abend code must ultimately be issued by resource
managers when the CANCEL exit is driven as a result of a suspend request.
System action: The agent cancel processing continues.
Normally, this situation does not result in a dump. However, a dump might result if the situation is encountered by
other resource managers, outside of DB2. When that happens, the dump can be ignored or suppressed.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer only if the abend results in the termination of the DB2
subsystem.
System programmer response: This reason code may be issued as a result of any connected TCB abend, or operator
-STOP DB2 MODE(FORCE) command. No further action is required.
The recovery routine for the CSECT issuing this reason code records information in the variable recording area
(VRA). If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: If DB2 abends, examine the SVC dump to determine the suspended resource manager and
the state of the failing subcomponent. For example, the ACEMC (must complete) bit should be off.

Explanation: The MVS cross-memory lock (CML) of the system services address space was held by the invoking
resource manager execution unit during invocation of the cancel, suspend, resume, or SRB redispatch functions. This
violates the entry protocols for these functions.
System action: The requesting execution unit is abended.
Because resource manager serialization cannot be maintained without the use of this lock, normal recovery is not
possible for this abend. The recovery routine terminates the DB2 subsystem through invocation of the agent services
subsystem termination protocol.
An '00E50054' recovery reason code is placed in the SDWACOMU field of the SDWA, indicating that synchronization
services was responsible for DB2 subsystem termination.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer, and restart DB2.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Internal protocols specify that no MVS locks may be held at DSNVSR or DSNVSDC0
invocation Determine the invoking resource manager, the function requested, and the current owner (ASCB) of the
CML lock at the time of the error. Diagnostic information for this error may be obtained through the SYS1.LOGREC

00E50051
Explanation: The resource manager requesting the resume function specified the TCTL=YES option while executing
in TCB mode. This violates the entry protocols for this function. This is a subsystem error.
System action: Mainline processing is abended with an '04E' abend code and this reason code.
Because this error is an internal resource manager protocol violation, normal recovery is not possible for this abend.
The recovery routine terminates the DB2 subsystem through invocation of the agent services subsystem termination
protocol. An '00E50054' recovery reason code is placed in the SDWACOMU field of the SDWA indicating that
synchronization services was responsible for DB2 subsystem termination.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer, and restart DB2.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Internal protocol documentation specifies that the TCTL=YES option is valid only for
resource managers executing in SRB mode at time of invocation. Determine the invoking resource manager at time of
error. Diagnostic information for this error may be obtained through the SYS1.LOGREC and DB2 SVC dump
materials provided.

Explanation: The MVS cross-memory lock (CML) of the system services address space could not be released during
termination processing of the cancel, suspend, resume, or SRB redispatch functions.
System action: Mainline processing is abended with an '04E' abend code and this reason code.
Because resource manager serialization can no longer be maintained without the use of this lock, normal recovery is
not possible for this abend. The recovery routine terminates the DB2 subsystem through invocation of the agent
services subsystem termination function.
An '00E50054' recovery reason code is placed in the SDWACOMU field of the SDWA indicating that synchronization
services was responsible for DB2 subsystem termination.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer, and restart DB2.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: For this abend to occur, the CML lock must have been successfully obtained at some point
during mainline processing. Determine the invoking resource manager, the function requested, and the current owner
(ASCB) of the CML lock at the time of the error. Diagnostic information for this error may be obtained through the
SYS1.LOGREC and DB2 SVC dump materials provided.

00E50054
Explanation: The DB2 subsystem is abended by the synchronization services recovery routine when an
unrecoverable error is encountered during recovery processing for the suspend, cancel, resume, or SRB redispatch
functions. This is a subsystem termination reason code.
System action: The DB2 subsystem is terminated. This reason code is associated with an '04F' abend code indicating
that synchronization services was responsible for termination.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer, and restart DB2.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Scan the MVS system log and the contents of SYS1.LOGREC for DB2 abends occurring
immediately before the system termination message DSNV086E. Follow the failure analysis procedures for the
specific abends. Refer to the appropriate CICS documentation for information about about X'04F' and X'04E' abend
completion codes.
One of the following conditions was encountered during recovery processing for the requested function:
v Unable to complete resume processing for an SRB mode execution unit that was suspended at time of error.
v Errors were encountered during primary recovery processing causing entry to the secondary recovery routine.
v Recovery initiated retry to mainline Suspend/Resume code caused retry recursion entry into the functional
recovery routine.
v Unable to obtain or release the cross-memory lock (CML) of the system services address space either during
mainline processing or during functional recovery processing (for example, reason code '00E50051' or '00E50052').
v The invoking resource manager requested the TCTL=YES option of the resume function while executing in TCB
mode (for example, reason code '00E50051').
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00E50055
Explanation: The synchronization services functional recovery routine was unable to successfully complete resume
processing for a suspended TCB mode execution unit. The resume processing was requested by the cancel or resume
functions. This reason code is placed in the SDWACOMU field of an SDWA.
System action: Because the suspended TCB mode execution unit must not be permitted to remain in a suspended
state, the recovery routine invokes the MVS CALLRTM (TYPE=ABTERM) service to abend the execution unit with an
'04F' completion code. Depending upon which execution unit was terminated, the DB2 subsystem may be abended.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer, and restart DB2 if necessary.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Scan the MVS system log and the contents of SYS1.LOGREC for DB2 abends occurring
immediately before the abend of the execution unit. Follow the failure analysis procedures for the specific abends.
Refer to the appropriate CICS documentation for information about X'04F' and X'04E' abend completion codes.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.

00E50059
Explanation: When preparing to resume an SRB, the target EB (execution block) was validated by checking the EB
identifier code in the first halfword of the control block. The identifier code was in error.
System action: If the CSECT detecting the error is DSNVSR, the error is percolated (passed) to the DB2 SRB
recovery task DSNVRCT. Ultimately, DB2 is terminated abnormally.
If the CSECT detecting the error is DSNVSDC0, the code detecting the error will be retried once. If validation fails,
the DB2 subsystem is terminated abnormally with a 00E50054 reason code.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer, and restart DB2.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
The recovery routine for the CSECT issuing this reason code records information in the variable recording area
(VRA).
Problem determination: A LOGREC entry and a DB2 dump are requested by the FRR DSNVSRR and by the
recovery routine in DSNVSDC0. Register 6 contains the address of the invalid EB.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00E50062
Explanation: An application request (RARQ) was issued to a resource access list (RAL). At the time of the request,
the RAL had the RAL suppress (RALSUPPR) flag on, and the function vector list entry (FVLE) that was accessed
(through FRBFVLE) did not have FVLEBIT0 on. This is not allowed. That is, the FVLE function is not allowed during
RAL suppress.
This error may indicate that an IMS/VS or CICS caller had completed Commit Phase 1 and that the next request was
not Commit Phase 2, Abort, or Terminate with the Commit or Abort option. This abend is the result of an internal
system problem, possibly the DB2 attachment facility or the requesting IMS/VS or CICS subsystem.
This abend reason code is issued by the following macro: DSNARARQ
System action: The allied task requesting the RARQ is abended.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: The recovery routines of the module invoking the DSNARARQ macro should have
requested SYS1.LOGREC recording and either an SVC or application dump (or both.) The FRB contains the
FRBRALE and FRBFVLE entries. It also contains the pointers to the RAL and to the execution block address (FRBEB).
Register 3 contains the address of the RAL from FRBRAL. Register 4 contains the address of the RALE as located by
the FRBRAL pointer (and as indexed by FRBRALE). Register 6 contains the address of the EB from FRBEB.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v CICS trace listing.
v CICS attachment facility MVS SNAP dump.
v CICS transaction dump.
v IMS trace output.
v IMS dependent region, control region dump, or both.
00E50063
Explanation: A resource access request (RARQ) was issued to a function vector list entry (FVLE) that is valid but
unauthorized for this allied user at this time. This abend occurs if a request is issued out of sequence. For example,
two consecutive CREATE THREAD requests would give this result. This abend also occurs if a request is issued that
is never authorized for the caller. For example, it occurs if a BATCH protocol user issues a PREPARE request. A
program call (PC) is issued to module DSN3ABND, which issues the X'04E' abend with this reason code.
System action: The task issuing the RARQ is abended. However, DB2 recovery may translate this abend to a return
code 256 with this reason code.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: This is a user error. The issuer of the RARQ was not authorized to use the requested
function at this time. The following diagnostic information is available:
v An entry in the DB2 trace table is made for entry to module DSN3ABND. The items traced are the RALE and the
FVLE of the intended DSNARARQ request. To determine the sequence of DSNARARQ requests, examine the
previous trace table entries for the same execution block (EB).
v An application dump is requested with DB2-supplied control blocks. This includes the FRB associated with the
intended DSNARARQ request. Fields FRBRALE and FRBFVLE contains the indexes for the intended request.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v SYSABEND, SYSUDUMP, or SYSMDUMP output.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00E50065
Explanation: RMRQ linkage was requested, specifying a function code that is undefined in the resource manager
function table (RMFT) of the designated resource manager.
System action: The execution unit under which RMRQ was requested is abended.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: The recovery routine of the abended resource manager module requested SYS1.LOGREC
recording and a DB2 SVC dump. Register 14 points to the resource manager module that requested linkage to the
undefined function.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00E50069
Explanation: This abend code is issued during recovery processing for the suspend function when executing in SRB
mode under the recovery routine established by the MVS SRBSTAT(SAVE) service. Because the recovery routine
established by this service is the only routine in the FRR stack at the time of error, normal RTM percolation to the
invoking resource manager recovery routine is not possible.
After recovery processing for the initial mainline error has successfully completed, the RTM environment is exited
through retry to a routine that restores the original FRR stack. This routine then issues an '04E' abend with this
reason code. This causes entry into the original recovery routine established during suspend initialization.
System action: After this abend is intercepted by the original suspend recovery routine, a SYS1.LOGREC entry and
DB2 SVC dump are requested to document the original error. The original recovery reason code is placed in the
SDWACOMU field of the SDWA indicating the actions performed during recovery processing of the initial error.
Control is then returned to the invoking resource manager's recovery routine through RTM percolation.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Because this abend is used only to permit the transfer of the initial recovery reason code to
the invoking resource manager's recovery routine, no further recovery actions are required for this abend. Diagnostic
information for the initial error encountered during mainline processing may be obtained through the SYS1.LOGREC
and SVC dump materials provided.
00E50070
Explanation: This abend reason code is issued in response to a delete service task request specifying purge.
Additionally, any service task not deleted by the owning resource manager at subsystem shutdown is abended with
this reason code.
System action: This abend usually occurs through MVS CALLRTM and, in certain cases, is issued by the service
task dispatcher executing under the TCB being abended. The service task is abended.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
The recovery routine for the CSECT issuing this reason code records information in the variable recording area
(VRA).
Problem determination: If the service task is abended with a completion code of X'04F', no DB2 SVC dump is
taken. Some resource managers have elected to terminate their service tasks with the purge option. Consequently, the
abend may or may not be an actual error. At the time of the abend, register 6 points to the execution block (EB) of
the execution unit that was active when the abend occurred. The EBSQH field in turn contains a pointer to the
service queue header associated with the abending service task.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00E50071
Explanation: This abend reason code is issued following a cancel return from the resume service during an attempt
to notify the create service task requester. Because the requester has been terminated, the newly created service task
must be terminated.
System action: The service task is abended.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
The recovery routine for the CSECT issuing this reason code records information in the variable recording area
(VRA). If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: At the time of the abend, register 6 points to the execution block (EB) assigned to the
service task dispatcher. The EBSQH field, in turn, contains a pointer to the service queue header associated with the
abending service task. From the SQH, determine the requesting resource manager. Prior SYS1.LOGREC entries may
indicate why the requester was terminated.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00E50072
Explanation: This abend reason code is issued following an unanticipated cancel return from DSNVSR for an
execution unit not expected to be canceled. This code is also a subsystem termination reason code if the abend was
issued by module DSNVCST0.
System action: The DB2 subsystem is abended.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer, and restart DB2.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For

v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00E50079
Explanation: An invalid address space (ASCE) was specified as the target of an execution unit switch request. This
can occur if the target is an allied address space or if the address space was concurrently undergoing termination.
This abend code may also be issued when a passed agent services control block is determined to be invalid.
System action: The requesting execution unit is abended.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis

00E50080
Explanation: An execution unit (SRB or TCB) processor determined that the current MVS Functional Recovery
Routine (FRR) stack contained one or more entries for FRR's which should not exist. This check is made at the
conclusion of a resource manager function executing under the SRB or TCB.
System action: An SVC dump is requested specifying an abend code of X'04E' and this reason code. The extraneous
FRR entries are deleted from the stack. Execution continues. The application is not notified.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer of the SVC dump.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: MVS console data is logged and the SVC dump is taken. No record is written to
SYS1.LOGREC.
One or more resource manager functions created an FRR which was not deleted. Examine the current FRR stack in
the PSA of the active CPU. The only valid stack entries are those established by DB2 and MVS Dump Services and, if
DSNVEUS2, an entry established by that module. The format of the FRR stack is provided as data area FRRS in the
appropriate MVS debugging guides.
00E50081
Explanation: A TCB execution unit processor determined that the list of active ESTAE exits associated with the TCB
contained one or more entries for ESTAEs which should not be active. This check is made at the conclusion of a
resource manager function executing under the TCB.
System action: An SVC dump is requested specifying an abend code of X'04E' and this reason code. The extraneous
ESTAE entries are deleted. Execution continues. The application is not notified.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer of the SVC dump.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: MVS console is logged and the SVC dump is taken. No record is written to SYS1.LOGREC.
One or more resource manager functions created an ESTAE exit which was not deleted. Locate the TCB requesting
the dump (It will be a DB2 service task in the home address space at the time the dump was requested.) Field
TCBSTABB points to a chain of ESTAE Control Blocks (SCB) for active exits. The only valid SCBs are for the ESTAE
exit established (with a token) by DSNVEUS3 and an ESTAI exit established when the task was created. SCBs are
located in LSQA. The SCB format is provided as a data area in the appropriate MVS debugging guides.
00E50094
Explanation: The macro service to get a resource options block (ROB) determined that a ROB taken from the ROB
cache was not formatted properly. This can occur if the queue which controls the ROB cache was overlaid, if the ROB
itself was overlaid, or if there is a programming error in DB2.
System action: The requesting execution unit is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Register zero, which should appear in the SYS1.LOGREC entry for this abend, contains the
address which should have pointed to a ROB but apparently did not.
Use the SYS1.LOGREC entry and the associated dump to examine the area which should have been a ROB. It may
also be helpful to examine the chain of ROBs in the cache. This chain is anchored in the DB2 DSNDVGCA control
block.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00E50095
Explanation: The macro service to release a resource options block (ROB) determined that a ROB passed to it for
release was not formatted properly and did not, in fact, appear to be a ROB at all. This can occur as a result of a
storage overlay or if there is a programming error in DB2.
System action: The requesting execution unit is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis

Explanation: The agent cancel function was unable to establish an ESTAE while preparing to cancel all active allied
agents during processing of the -STOP DB2 MODE(FORCE) command.
System action: The abend is passed on to a subsystem support subcomponent (SSS) ESTAE. Probably, DB2 is
abended.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer, and restart DB2.
System programmer response: The inability to establish an ESTAE is normally due to insufficient free space in the
local system queue area (LSQA) for an ESTAE control block (SCB). If necessary, increase the size of the system
services address space.
Problem determination: Review the associated SVC dump for usage and free areas in the LSQA subpools belonging
to the system services address space.

The recovery routine for the CSECT issuing this reason code records information in the variable recording area
(VRA).
Problem determination: DB2 diagnostic information may be obtained through SYS1.LOGREC and SVC dump
materials generated at the time of the original error. Refer to the accompanying abend code to determine the failure
while in 'must complete' state. Refer to Appendix E, ¡°DB2 abend completion codes (X'04E' and X'04F),¡± on page 1287
for information about X'04F' and X'04E' abend completion codes.

The 'must complete' indicator is bit ACEMC. Latch-held indicators are in field EBLTCHLD. Latch waiter status
information is in field EBLWSI.
Usually these conditions occur as the result of a prior failure where the associated recovery routine did not perform
correct resource cleanup. The condition may also occur if a resource manager function does not release all latches
and/or reset the 'must complete' bit before returning control to either DSNVEUS2 or DSNVEUS3.

System programmer response: Request the SYS1.LOGREC and SVC dump. If you suspect an error in DB2, you
might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data
(Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: This is an internal error.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v SVC dump (or system dump), taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, as result of an operator-initiated dump command
or SLIP trap exit.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00E60087
Explanation: An internal error occurred attempting to free the MVS CML lock.
System action: The request is abended.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Request the SYS1.LOGREC and SVC dump. If you suspect an error in DB2, you
might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data
(Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: This error is an internal error.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v SVC dump (or system dump), taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, as result of an operator-initiated dump command
or SLIP trap exit.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00E60088
Explanation: An internal logic problem occurred on a READS request. The event is being traced asynchronously,
which is not allowed.
System action: The request is abended.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Request the SYS1.LOGREC and SVC dump. If you suspect an error in DB2, you
might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data
(Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: This is an internal error.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v SVC dump (or system dump), taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, as result of an operator-initiated dump command
or SLIP trap exit.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00E60800
Explanation: The command was completed, but the return area was not large enough to accommodate all the
output messages. The return area contains the last complete message segment that fit. The IFCABM field in the IFCA
indicates the number of bytes moved to the return area. The IFCABNM field in the IFCA indicates the number of
bytes which were not moved because the return area was too small.
User response: Allocate more storage for the return area, if desired, and reissue the request.
00E60801
Explanation: The command was partially completed, but an internal error was encountered. Check the return area
for a message.
User response: Dependent upon the message in the return area.
00E60802
Explanation: The instrumentation facility request was partially completed, but the return area was not large enough
to accommodate all the output. The return area contains the last complete record that fit. The IFCABM field in the
IFCA indicates the number of bytes moved to the return area for the READS or READA request. The IFCABNM field
in the IFCA indicates the number of bytes that could not fit in the return area.
User response: Allocate more return area storage and reissue the request.
00E60803
Explanation: No data was returned from the READA request because none was available. Either the OPn storage
buffer was empty or the application program had already retrieved all the trace records.
00E60804
Explanation: No data was returned from the READS or READA request, or no data was returned for at least one of
the requested IFCIDs on a READS request for multiple IFCIDs. This can happen for one of these reasons:
v The destination OPx value specified in the IFCA was not active for a READA request.
v The qualification information specified did not match a process for a READS request.
v No information was available for a READS request.
v The user return area on a READS or READA request was too small to receive even a single record.
User response: If the OPn destination was not active, then activate the OPn destination or issue the request using an
OPn destination that is active.
If the IFCABNM field (number of bytes not moved) is nonzero, then the user return area is too small. Increase the
size of the user return area, and resubmit the request.
00E60805
Explanation: The request for information resulted in an abend.
User response: Dependent upon the abend code in the log record. Refer to the IFCABM field in the IFCA (the
number of bytes moved to the return area) to determine if partial information was returned.
Problem determination: See EREP log record in SYS1.LOGREC. See the Environmental Record Editing and Printing
program (EREP) User's Guide and Reference for instructions on how to print SYS1.LOGREC.
00E60806
Explanation: The request for information resulted in an abend, perhaps because one of the parameters on the call
was invalid. If a SYSUDUMP or SYSABEND DD statement is present in your JCL, you will receive an abend dump.
User response: Dependent upon the abend code.
Problem determination: See abend code in abend dump or EREP log record in SYS1.LOGREC. Examine the
parameter list. Among other possible causes, the high-order bit of the last parameter must be on in order to indicate
the end of the parameter list. See the Environmental Record Editing and Printing program (EREP) User's Guide and
Reference for instructions on how to print SYS1.LOGREC.
00E60807
Explanation: The request for information resulted in an abend, possibly because either the ACE token passed was
invalid or became invalid during processing. In this case, no SDUMP is taken and control returns to the application
program.
User response: If your application program does not pass a token, you can reissue the previous IFI request from the
application program.
Problem determination: If the application program passes an ACE token, the token is probably invalid.
00E60808
Explanation: The request for information resulted in an abend. Perhaps a DB2 structure became invalid while your
application program was using it.
User response: To reduce the chance of this occurring, issue requests from a task with a higher priority than DB2
and its users. Certain requests (for example, a READS for IFCIDs 0147 and 0148) are more likely to encounter this
type of problem. The request may be reissued. No SDUMP is taken and control is returned to the application
program.
00E60809
Explanation: An IFI READS request for the IDCID 129 record was only partially successful. The request attempted
to obtain CIs that have yet to be written. All available complete CIs were returned.
User response: No response is needed. All available CI's were returned.
Problem determination: Examine the WQALLRBA and WQALLNUM fields of the READS request. (WQALLRBA +
(WQALLNUM * 4KB)) > ending RBA of the last complete CI in the log.
00E6080A
Explanation: On a READS request for IFCID 316, the request was partially successful. The return area was not big
enough to accommodate all the output. The return area contains up to the last record that fits.
User response: Allocate more return area storage and reissue the request.
00E6080B
Explanation: On a READS request for IFCID 317, no data was returned because a matching statement was not
found.
User response: Ensure that the statement identifier for a currently cached statement is provided and reissue the
request.
00E6080C
Explanation: On a READS request for IFCID 316, no data was returned because no statements matched the
qualification criteria. This reason code can occur when WQALFLTR = X'02' and no cached statements exceed the
threshold specified in WQALFVAL. This reason code can also occur if the dynamic statement cached but no
statements have yet been inserted into the cache.
User response: Adjust the qualification criteria and reissue the request.
00E60810
Explanation: A READS request for IFCID 0254 was partially successful. The return area was not large enough to
accommodate all output. The return area contains as many complete records as can fit.
User response: Allocate more return area storage and reissue the request.
Problem determination:
00E60811
Explanation: On a READS request for IFCID 0254, no data was returned because no qualified data sets or group
buffer pools were connected.
User response: Ensure that the qualified data sets or group buffer pools are connected, and reissue the request.
00E60812
Explanation: On a READS request for IFCID 0306, log records are returned. The end-of-scope log point has been
reached and no position is held in the log. The end-of-scope log point is returned in field QW0306ES, and the
number of records is returned in field QW0306CT from the QW0306 section.
User response: A WQALMODT request to terminate the log position might be necessary to release held resources,
or a WQALMODF request after a pause to initiate a first call.
Problem determination:
00E60813
Explanation: On a READS request for IFCID 0306, no data is returned because no log records were found that met
the criteria. No position is held in the log. The end-of-scope log point is returned in field QW0306ES and zero is
returned in field QW0306CT from the QW0306 section.
User response: If this is caused by a WQALMODN call, issue a WQALMODF call after a pause to initiate a first
call. However, there is still no guarantee that log records will be returned that meet the criteria.
Problem determination:
00E60814
Explanation: On a READS request for IFCID 0306, a WQALMODT call was invoked to terminate log position when
no position is held in the log.
Problem determination:
00E60815
Explanation: On a READA or READS request for multiple members of a data sharing group, the return area was
not large enough to hold all the data returned from other members. This reason code is returned in field IFCAGRSN
of the IFCA.
User response: Increase the size of the return area.
00E60816
Explanation: On a READA or READS request for multiple members of a data sharing group, no data was returned
from other members of the data sharing group. This reason code is returned in field IFCAGRSN of the IFCA.
00E60820
Explanation: The command request did not complete normally. Check the IFCABM field in the IFCA to see if any
message segments have been returned. There are many reasons for this condition, including:
v Command authorization failure
v Command processor abend
v Command syntax error
v Command output limit being exceeded.
Problem determination: To determine the reason for the failure, analyze the message or messages that are returned.
00E60821
Explanation: The request was not processed because a specified IFCID is not valid for the READS or WRITE
function.
User response: Remove or replace the invalid IFCID.
Problem determination: Check the IFCA diagnostic area (IFCAD) for the IFCID in error.
00E60823
Explanation: The WRITE request was not processed because the IFCID specified was not active.
User response: Activate the IFCID or reissue the request with a different IFCID.
00E60824
Explanation: An authorization failure occurred. On a READA request, the ownership token specified did not match
the owner of an active trace, or on either a READA or READS request the user did not have the correct monitor
authority.
User response: Reissue the request with the correct ownership token for the desired OPn destination or obtain the
appropriate monitor authority, as needed.
Problem determination: Examine the specified ownership token and the monitor authority of the user.
00E60825
Explanation: Stack storage was not available for copying the output area.
00E60826
Explanation: On a READA request, the destination specified did not match a valid destination.
User response: Reissue the request using a valid destination.
00E60827
Explanation: On a READA request, the destination specified did not have an instrumentation facility buffer
assigned. The application program must start a trace to the destination specified before attempting a READA request.
User response: Start a trace to the desired destination, and reissue the request.
00E60828
Explanation: On a READS request for IFCID 149 or 150, IRLM was not able to return all the data that was
applicable to the queried agent or resource. IRLM can return a maximum of 32KB of lock data about a given agent or
resource. If IRLM notifies DB2 that more than 32KB of lock data is applicable for a given agent or resource, then DB2
does not request the information from IRLM. No data is returned, and reason code 00E60828 is issued by IFI.
User response: The READS request for IFCID 149 OR 150 continues to return code 00E60828 until less than 32KB of
lock data is applicable to the given agent or resource that the READS request for IFCID 149 or 150 is querying. You
can continue to issue READS requests for IFCID 149 or 150 with no guarantee that the volume of lock data has
decreased.
00E60829
Explanation: On a READS request, an unexpected return code was received from IRLM.
00E60830
Explanation: An unexpected return code was received on a READS request.
User response: Reissue the request. If the condition persists, contact your IBM support center and tell them the
message you are encountering.
00E60831
Explanation: A number of abends have occurred while processing IFI requests resulting in the disabling of all IFI
request and MONITOR trace processing.
User response: Issue a -START TRACE to clear the condition. This condition may not be cleared by issuing the
-START TRACE command via instrumentation facility interface COMMAND function.
Problem determination: Obtain a copy of the system or terminal log. If a dump was produced, have it printed.
Print a copy of the contents of SYS1.LOGREC for the time period involved. Forward these items along with a copy of
the system log to the systems programmer.
00E60832
Explanation: The IFCID specified on a READS was not active.
User response: Issue a -START TRACE for monitor class 1.
00E60833
Explanation: A request for storage from the log-read storage pool has failed due to exhaustion of available storage
or four log-read read requests are already holding storage from the pool.
User response: Allow other active READS requests for IFCID 129 to finish and then reissue the request.
Problem determination: Examine the activity of READS requests for IFCID 129. If requests for more than 64 CIs are
active at the same time, storage problems may occur.
00E60834
Explanation: An unexpected return code was received from log manager macro DSNJOLGR.
User response: Reissue the request. If the problem persists, contact your IBM service representative.
Problem determination: Examine the validity of WQALLRBA and WQALLNUM fields.
00E60835
Explanation: An unexpected return code was received from Log Manager Macro DSNJLGR.
User response: Reissue the request. If the problem persists, contact your IBM service representative.
Problem determination: Examine the validity of WQALLRBA and WQALLNUM fields.
00E60836
Explanation: An unexpected return code was received from log manager macro DSNJCLGR.
User response: Reissue the request. If the problem persists, contact your IBM service representative.
Problem determination: Examine the validity of WQALLRBA and WQALLNUM fields.
00E60837
Explanation: On an IFI READS request for IFCID 1 or 2, storage was not available to satisfy the request.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
User response: Reissue the request. This condition is only temporary and should be extremely rare. If this condition
persists, contact your IBM support representative, and tell them the message you are encountering.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00E60838
Explanation: On a READS request for IFCID 0254, a resource was unavailable while attempting to collect statistics
for a specific group buffer pool.
User response: Reissue the request. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: The group buffer pool name and the reason code returned from the internal macro are
saved in fields IFCAGBPN and IFCAR0B.
00E60839
Explanation: On a READS request for IFCID 149 or 150, IRLM was not able to return all the data that was available
to the queried agent or resource. IRLM can return a maximum of 32KB of lock data about an agent or resource. If
IRLM notifies DB2 that more than 32KB of lock data is available for that agent or resource, DB2 requests the
information from IRLM, but returns up to 32KB of information to the application and IFI issues this reason code.
Problem determination:
00E6083A
Explanation: On a READS request for IFCID 316 or IFCID 317 no data was returned because Dynamic Statement
Caching is not active on this DB2 system.
User response: The Dynamic Statement Cache must be activated through a system initialization parameter before
READS requests can be processed for IFCID 316 or 317.
00E60840
Explanation: An invalid function was specified. The function specified does not match one of the IFI supported
functions.
User response: Correct the function field of the DSNWLI call so that it is a left-justified, 8-character field containing
WRITE, READA, READS, or COMMAND.
00E60841
Explanation: The IFCA was specified incorrectly. The return code and reason code will be placed at the correct offset
in the erroneous IFCA. The IFCA length might be invalid, or the IFCA eye-catcher (IFCAID) might be missing.
User response: Examine the length of the IFCA and the eye-catcher field of the IFCA. Correct any mistakes.
Problem determination: See the return and reason codes placed at the correct offset in the erroneous IFCA.
00E60842
Explanation: The return area was specified incorrectly. The length might be invalid. The length of the return area
must be a fullword. The valid range for the return area length on IFI READS requests is X'000000064' to X'7FFFFFFF'.
The valid range for the return area length on all other IFI requests is X'000000064' to X'00100000'.
User response: Respecify the return area length to conform to the valid range.
00E60843
Explanation: The IFCID area was specified incorrectly. The length might be invalid. The valid range is from X'0006'
to X'0044'.
User response: Respecify the IFCID area length field to conform to the valid range.
Problem determination: Examine the length field of the IFCID area.
00E60844
Explanation: The qualification area was specified incorrectly. The length might be invalid, or the WQAL eye-catcher
(WQALEYE) might be missing.
User response: Correct any incorrect specification of the qualification area length and eye-catcher fields.
Problem determination: Examine the length and eye-catcher fields of the qualification area.
00E60845
Explanation: An IFCID specified for a READS or a WRITE request was invalid.
User response: Replace the errant IFCID with a valid one or remove it from the request.
Problem determination: Check the IFCA diagnostic area for the IFCID in error.
00E60846
Explanation: The output area was specified incorrectly.
User response: Correct either the output area length or the output area parameter on the DSNWLI call, depending
on which one is in error.
Problem determination: The length might be invalid; the valid range is from X'000A' to X'1000'. Also, the output
area parameter on the DSNWLI call may have been specified as zero. The output area parameter must point to a
valid output area.
00E60847
Explanation: The buffer information area was specified incorrectly.
User response: Check that the buffer information area has an eye-catcher value of 'WBUF' and a length value equal
to the length of 'WBUF' and correct any invalid values.
Problem determination: The length might be invalid, or the 'WBUF' eye-catcher might be missing.
00E60849
Explanation: The parameters are specified incorrectly on the IFI command request.
User response: If the selective dump function is not being used, check that the parameters are specified correctly on
the IFI request. If the selective dump function is being used, notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: If the selective dump function is not being used, check that the parameters are correctly
specified on the command request. Among other possible causes, the high-order bit of the last parameter must be on
in order to indicate the end of the parameter list. For assembler users, this can be done by using the VL option on the
call. Another possible cause is the sixth parameter is specified on the IFI request. The sixth parameter is reserved for
the selective dump function.
00E60850
Explanation: An invalid WQALLTYP value was specified on a READS request.
User response: Correct the invalid WQALLTYP value and reissue the request.
Problem determination: Examine the validity of the WQALLTYP field. It must be 'CI'.
00E60851
Explanation: An invalid WQALLMOD value was specified on a READS request.
User response: Correct the invalid WQALLMOD value and reissue the request.
Problem determination: Examine the validity of the WQALLMOD field. It must be 'F' or 'R'.
00E60852
Explanation: An invalid WQALLRBA value was specified on a READS request. The starting CI log RBA must end
in X'000'.
User response: Correct the invalid WQALLRBA value and reissue the request.
Problem determination: Examine the validity of the WQALLRBA field. It must end in X'000'.
00E60853
Explanation: An invalid WQALLNUM value was specified on a READS request. The valid range is X'0001' to
X'0007'.
User response: Correct the invalid WQALLNUM value and reissue the request.
Problem determination: Examine the validity of the WQALLNUM field. The valid range is X'0001' to X'0007'.
00E60854
Explanation: The specified WQALLRBA was not in the active log.
User response: Correct the invalid WQALLRBA value and reissue the request.
Problem determination: Examine the validity of the WQALLRBA field. Check the beginning RBA of the active log.
The WQALLRBA field must be greater than or equal to the beginning RBA value of the active log. The RBA of the
first CI in the active log will be returned in field IFCAFCI or it can be determined by running the print log map
(DSNJU004) utility.
00E60855
Explanation: A log RBA value past the end of the current active log was specified. The specified WQALLRBA value
was beyond the end of the log. The CI has yet to be written.
User response: Correct the invalid WQALLRBA value and reissue the request.
Problem determination: Examine the validity of the WQALLRBA field. Check the ending RBA of the log. The
WQALLRBA field must be less than the ending RBA value.
00E60856
Explanation: No complete CI's are available from the RBA specified in WQALLRBA.
User response: Lower the value in WQALLRBA by at least X'1000' or wait until at least one CI has been written
beyond the RBA specified in WQALLRBA and reissue the request.
Problem determination: Examine the WQALLRBA field and determine whether or not one complete CI beyond
WQALLRBA has been written to the log.
00E60857
Explanation: This code indicates that an IFI READS request for IFCID 185 contained an invalid WQALCDCD value.
System action: Control returns to the user program with return code 0000000C in field IFCARC1 and reason code 00E60857 in field IFCARC2.
User response: WQALCDCD is a user-specified field in the QUAL_AREA of an IFI READS for IFCID 185. Reissue
the request with a valid WQALCDCD value. For IFI READS requests for IFCID 185, the valid values are A, Y, and N.
If a value is not specified, a value of A is used as the default.

00E60858
Explanation: This code indicates that an IFI READS request for IFCID 185 was denied because the system
parameters indicate that data capture processing is not allowed on this DB2 system. The system parameter field
SPRMCDC is set to 'no'.
System action: Control returns to the user program with return code 0000000C in field IFCARC1 and reason code 00E60858 in field IFCARC2.
User response: Inspect system parameter SPRMCDC. If change data capture is not allowed on this system, consult
with the database administrator to determine if the system parameter should be changed to 'yes' to allow DB2 data
capture processing.

Explanation: An IFI READS request for IFCID 129 was made to pass the last partially full log CI to the log exit, but
the log exit is not active. Either the log exit (DSNJW117) was not installed, or an error in the exit has deactivated the
exit.
User response: Either install the log capture exit, or look for message DSNJ150E indicating that the log capture exit
has been deactivated. See the description for DSNJ150E for more information about reactivating the log capture exit.
00E60860
Explanation: On a READS request for IFCID 0254, an error was encountered while collecting statistics for a group
buffer pool.
User response: Reissue the request. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: The group buffer pool name is saved in field IFCAGBPN. The reason and return code from
the internal macro are saved in fields IFCAR0B and IFCAR1B.
00E60861
Explanation: An invalid WQALGBPN value was specified on a READS request.
User response: Correct the invalid WQALGBPN value and reissue the request.
Problem determination: Examine the validity of the WQALGBPN field. The qualifier is an 8-byte group buffer pool
name in which an imbedded X'00' is used as a pattern character.
00E60863
Explanation: On a READS request for IFCID 0306, a resource was unavailable while attempting to read the log.
User response: Resolve the unavailable resource, and reissue the request. You cannot retry the request with the
WQALLMOD value set to 'N' after a READS request fails. Set the WQALLMOD value in the qualification area to 'F'
or 'D' when you retry the READS request.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Related reference:
Qualification fields for READS requests (DB2 Performance)
00E60864
Explanation: On a READS request for IFCID 0306, the return area supplied was not large enough to hold one log
record. No log record is returned, but position is held in the log.
User response: Increase the size of the return area and issue a WQALMODN request. If you suspect an error in
DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see
Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: The size of the return area required is returned in field IFCABSRQ of the IFCA return area.
00E60865
Explanation: On a READS request for IFCID 0306, no data is returned for a WQALMODF call because log position
is already held in the log, possibly by a previous WQALMODF call.
User response: You might want to use a WQALMODN request instead.
Problem determination:
00E60866
Explanation: On a READS request for IFCID 0306, no data is returned for a WQALMODN call because no log
position is held in the log.
User response: A WQALMODF call might be necessary before a WQALMODN call.
Problem determination:
00E60867
Explanation: An invalid WQALLRBA value was specified on a READS request for IFCID 0306. The specified value
exceeds the end-of-log.
User response: Correct the WQALLRBA field. A pause might also be necessary before you issue a WQALMODF
request again.
Problem determination:
00E60868
Explanation: The return area was specified incorrectly for IFCID 0306. The return area did not reside in ECSA
storage.
User response: Respecify the return area and make sure that it resides in ECSA storage.
Problem determination:
00E60869
Explanation: An invalid WQALLCRI field was specified on a READS request for IFCID 0306.
User response: Correct the invalid WQALLCRI field and reissue the request.
Problem determination: Check the validity of the WQALLCRI field. It must be X'00'.
00E60870
Explanation: An invalid WQALLOPT field was specified on a READS request for IFCID 0306.
User response: Correct the invalid WQALLOPT field and reissue the request.
Problem determination: Check the validity of WQALLOPT field. It must be X'00' or X'01'.
00E60871
Explanation: On a READS request for IFCID 306, log records are returned, but data is not decompressed as
requested.
Problem determination: See the reason code in field QW0306DG to determine why decompression was not
performed. One reason code can be 00C90064, which means that the decompression dictionary changed since the log
record was written.
00E60872
Explanation: On a READS request for IFCID 0306, no data is returned for a WQALMODD call because log position
is already held in the log, possibly by a previous WQALMODF or WQALMODN call.
User response: If WQALMODD is desired, make sure that a WQALMODT call has been issued first.
Problem determination:
00E60873
Explanation: On a READS request for IFCID 0306, no data is returned for a WQALMODF call because the RBA
supplied was too old. This is because DB2 has migrated into and out of or out of data sharing mode.
User response: The change of mode into and out of data sharing also changes the log sequencing from RBA to
LRSN and back to RBA. A log read application that is sensitive to log sequencing should take an appropriate action.
A cold start of the application might be necessary.
Problem determination:
00E60874
Explanation: An invalid value was specified for WQALFFLD on a READS request for IFCID 316 or 401.
See the definition in the DSNDWQAL parameter block for valid values.
User response: Correct the invalid WQALFLTR value and reissue the request.
00E60875
Explanation: An invalid value was specified for WQALFFLD on a READS request for IFCID 316 or 401.
See the definition in the DSNDWQAL parameter block for valid values. This error might also be issued if
WQALFLTR = X'02' is specified with WQALFFLD = 'A'.
User response: Correct the invalid WQALFFLD value and reissue the request.
00E60876
Explanation: The READS request failed because either WQALPLOC, WQALPCOL, or WQALPPNM could not be
converted to UTF-8.
User response: Reissue the request. If the problem persists, contact DB2 Support.
00E60878
Explanation: An IFI READS request for IFCID 0306 or IFCID 0401 was issued on a thread that was not allocated for
processing SQL statements. Because the thread was not allocated for SQL processing, no plan was allocated and the
requested information was not available.
User response: Reissue the IFI READS request on a thread that is allocated to process SQL statements.

00E60886
Explanation: This reason code is used to indicate that an invalid IAMQ function was passed to module
DSNWVZXT. This problem should not occur.
System action: The function requested is abended. The DB2 subsystem remains operational and the functional
recovery will retry if possible.
Problem determination: The IAMQ function requested does not match a function handled by DSNWZXT. Analyze
the dump and previous SYS1.LOGREC entries do isolate the cause of the problem.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00E60887
Explanation: The reason code is set by the Instrumentation Statistics Facility FRR routine when an abend condition
occurs during statistics gathering. The reason code only appears in the VRA data of SYS1.LOGREC to indicate the
WWAB block exists in the variable recording area following the standard DB2 information.
System action: Depending on the number of errors the Instrumentation Statistics Facility may be turned off. The
FRR will attempt a retry to RTM to keep the DB2 subsystem operational.
System programmer response: The recovery routine for the CSECT issuing this reason code records information in
the variable recording area (VRA). If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Normally the standard SYS1.LOGREC entries provide the necessary information to isolate
the failing module. The WWAB control block in the variable recording area provides the resource manager RMID last
called (WWABRMID) and the RMID of which resource manager Instrumentation Statistics Facility called when the
failure occurred (WWABFRMS). If WWABFRMS is binary zero, then the error occurred in the Instrumentation
Statistics Facility.
00E60888
Explanation: The reason code is set by the Instrumentation Accounting Facility FRR routine when an abend
condition occurs during the accounting function. The reason code only appears in the VRA data of SYS1.LOGREC to
indicate the WWAB block exists in the variable recording area following the standard DB2 information.
System action: Depending on the number of errors the Instrumentation Accounting Facility may be turned off. The
FRR will attempt a retry to RTM to keep the DB2 subsystem operational.
System programmer response: The recovery routine for the CSECT issuing this reason code records information in
the variable recording area (VRA). If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Normally the SYS1.LOGREC standard entries provide the necessary information to isolate
the failing module. The WWAB control block in the variable recording area provides the resource manager RMID last
called (WWABRMID) and the RMID of which resource manager Instrumentation Statistics Facility called when the
failure occurred (WWABFRMS). If WWABFRMS is binary zero, then the error occurred in the Instrumentation
Accounting Facility.
00E60889
Explanation: An internal error has occurred on an IFI request. The reason code only appears in the variable
recording area (VRA) data of SYS1.LOGREC to indicate the FRR tracking (FRT) area exists in the VRA following the
standard DB2 information.
System action: The IFI request abnormally terminates.
Problem determination: The recovery routine for the CSECT that issues this reason code records information in the
variable recording area (VRA). If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
00E60900
Explanation: This is an informational code. One or more data rows defined with DATA CAPTURE CHANGES
might not have been retrieved.
System action: All successfully retrieved data rows defined with DATA CAPTURE CHANGES are returned in the
return area. One header instance of 0185 is returned for each data row associated with a failure or warning. A reason
code in field QW0185RC in the header indicates the reason for the failure or warning.
Problem determination: Inspect the reason code in QW0185RC to determine the cause of each failure or warning.
00E60901
Explanation: The available buffer is not large enough to hold the largest 0185 record instance.
System action: No data is returned.
User response: Reissue the IFI READS request for IFCID 0185 with a larger return area. The suggested size of the
new area is 4KB more than the original size.
00E60902
Explanation: The IFI READS request for IFCID 0185 is invalid. The READS request tried to retrieve captured DB2
table changes, but no data was captured for the current SQL statement.
System action: No data is returned.
User response: Ensure that the IFI READS request follows the current SQL statement and precedes any subsequent
SQL statement. Captured data must be retrieved at the time of the SQL call.
00E60903
Explanation: One or more data rows marked with DATA CAPTURE CHANGES were not retrieved. In addition,
there is insufficient space in the return area to hold all the data in an IFI READS request for IFCID 0185. This is a
combination code for 00E60900 and 00E60802.
System action: As many complete 0185 records as can fit are returned in the return area. Also, one 0185 header
record is returned for each failed data row. The reason code in field QW0185RC in the header indicates the reason for
the failure.
User response: Refer to the description of reason codes 00E60900 and 00E60802 for details.
00E60904
Explanation: The IFI READS request for IFCID 0185 could not be executed successfully because a resource was not
available. Some 0185 record instances might have been returned to the return area before the problem occurred.
System action: The last 0185 record instance returned is type D (QW0185TP = D). Field QW0185RC contains a
reason code for the specific unavailable resource. In addition, the data portion (QW0185DR) of this record instance
contains the following message:
UNSUCCESSFUL EXECUTION CAUSED BY AN
UNAVAILABLE RESOURCE. REASON reason,
TYPE OF RESOURCE type,
AND RESOURCE NAME name
In the message, reason is identical to field QW0185RC. The variables type and name identify the specific resource that
is unavailable at the time.
User response: Retrieve all returned record instances. Examine the reason code (QW0185RC) for each instance for
other possible errors or warnings. Use the reason code in QW0185RC and the error message in QW0185DR to
determine why the resource is unavailable.

00E60A00
Explanation: An outdated data description was detected. A requester specified no data description to be returned in
an IFI READS request for IFCID 0185. That is, the WQALCDCD field of the qualification area is set to N, but a
description change (ALTER TABLE ADD) that requires a refresh of the data description occurred.
This reason code does not apply to the success or failure of the IFI request, but rather to the status of the data in the
IFCID 0185 record.
System action: The system returns an IFI record with this reason code. The 0185 record instance that contains the
reason code has the header portion only, and the timestamp, log RBA, and operation code fields in the header
contain only zeros.
This reason code is issued one time only for each table within each SQL scope.
User response: Either use an SQL DESCRIBE statement to get the new description, or consider changing the IMS
DataPropagator exit routine to set WQALCDCD to A or Y.
Related reference:
IMS DataPropagator exit routines (IMS DataPropagator Concepts)
00E60A01
Explanation: The data row marked with DATA CAPTURE CHANGES is rejected by the installation-defined edit
procedure 'proc-name' for the object table. This reason code does not apply to the success or failure of the IFI request,
but rather the status of the data in the IFCID 0185 record.
System action: The following message is returned in the data area of 0185:
VIOLATION OF INSTALLATION DEFINED
EDIT PROCEDURE proc-name.
REASON CODE: reason-code
In the message, proc-name is the edit procedure name and reason-code is EXPLRC2 returned by the edit procedure.
User response: Examine the edit procedure for any errors. If it is not an edit procedure error, determine the
requirements imposed by the edit procedure.
00E60A08
Explanation: The following message is returned in the data portion of the data row area in the 0185 trace record:
COLUMN column_name ON TABLE table_name IN VIOLATION OF INSTALLATION DEFINED FIELD PROCEDURE. RT:
return_code, RS: reason_code, MSG: message_token.
An installation field procedure returned an error indicated by return_code for column column_name on table
table_name. Use return_code to determine the problem. The return code can be:
4 Invalid value on decode
8 Invalid parameter value
12 Field procedure error on any function
Use reason_code and message_token for additional information. This reason code does not apply to the success or
failure of the IFI request, but to the status of the data in the IFCID 0185 record.
System action: Whenever this reason code is present in the QW0185RC field in the record header, no record is
returned in the data row section for this table. The message listed above takes its place. The length of the record
corresponds to the message length.
Programmer response: Examine the field procedure for any errors. If it is not a field procedure error, determine the
requirements imposed by the field procedure.
00E60A09
Explanation: The following message is returned in the data portion of the data row area in the 0185 trace record:
INCORRECT DATA RETURNED FROM FIELD PROCEDURE
fieldproc_name FOR TABLE table_name AND
COLUMN column_name,
MSG: message_token
Unexpected data was returned from field procedure fieldproc_name and for column column_name on table table_name.
For more information see message_token. This reason code does not apply to the success or failure of the IFI request,
but to the status of the data in the IFCID 0185 record.
System action: Whenever this reason code is present in the QW0185RC field in the record header, no record is
returned in the data row section for this table. The message listed above takes its place. The length of the record
corresponds to the message length.
Programmer response: Correct the field procedure so that it returns values and their descriptions that are mutually
consistent.
00E60A0A
Explanation: The following message was returned in the data portion of the data row area in the 0185 trace record:
AN INSTALLATION FIELD PROCEDURE HAS RETURNED A RETURN CODE IN REGISTER 15 OTHER THAN AN EXPECTED 0 OR 4
This indicates that an installation field procedure returned an unexpected error. This reason code does not apply to
the success or failure of the IFI request, but to the status of the data in the IFCID 0185 record.
System action: Whenever this reason code is present in the QW0185RC field in the record header, no record is
returned in the data row section for this table. The message listed above takes the place of the record. The length of
the record corresponds to the message length.
Programmer response: Examine the field procedure for the specific return code generated.
00E60A0B
Explanation: This is a warning code, and does not represent an error. For the corresponding data row with this
reason code in field QW0185RC, a date or time column value was returned in the ISO format, even though the
date/time installation option was specified as LOCAL. Invocation of local date and time exits is not supported for
captured data. This reason code does not apply to the success or failure of the IFI request, but to the status of the
data in the IFCID 0185 record.
System action: A date or time column value was returned in the ISO format even though the installation option was
specified as LOCAL.
Programmer response: The requester needs to be aware that a date or time was returned in ISO format since the
LOCAL date and time installation option, which was in effect at the time of capture, is not supported for data
capture.
00E60B01
Explanation: An installation field procedure wrote beyond the end of the output buffer.
System action: The execution unit requests an SVC dump, and terminates abnormally.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Correct the field procedure.
Problem determination: At the time of abend the register contents are:
R2 The first 4 characters of the field procedure name
R3 The second 4 characters of the field procedure name
Related concepts:
Field procedures (DB2 Administration Guide)
00E60B02
Explanation: Invalid data was returned from the edit procedure. The data is invalid for one or more of these
reasons:
v The first byte or the last byte of the input record was modified by the exit.
v The length of the edited data is greater than the maximum allowed for this row, or less than one.
v The exit returned a row that overran the output area.
System action: An execution unit requests an SVC dump. The execution unit then terminates abnormally.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
00E60B03
Explanation: An internal inconsistency was detected by DB2 during data propagation processing.
System action: An execution unit requests an SVC dump. The execution unit then terminates abnormally.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
Problem determination: At the time of abend, register 2 points to the error message.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00E60B04
Explanation: During the retrieval of captured table data in preparation for propagation to IMS, an invalid data type
was found. This data type is not supported for propagation from DB2 to IMS. Since the invalid data type cannot be
returned to the Data Propagator (DPROP) exit routine, processing is terminated abnormally. This is an internal DB2
error.
System action: An execution unit requests an SVC dump, and terminates abnormally.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: The current SQL statement performed an INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, or DELETE,
for a DB2 table that was defined with DATA CAPTURE CHANGES. The captured data changes are reflected in the
DB2 log.
Check the captured table data information returned to DPROP for propagation to determine which data type is
invalid.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
00E60100-00E60199
Explanation: The reason codes 00E60100 through 00E60199 are used by the instrumentation facility component (IFC)
when a trace event occurs for which IBM service personnel have requested a dump using the DSN1SDMP utility.
System action: The abending agent might be retried or terminated, depending upon the serviceability dump
request.
Problem determination: The abend is issued on the occurrence of a specified trace event. A SVC dump is taken to
the SUS1.DUMPxx data set. Problem determination methods depend on the condition that IBM service personnel are
attempting to trap.

Explanation: A relational data system (RDS) subcomponent internal inconsistency was detected.
System action: The application program abends.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: This code generates an SVC dump and SYS1.LOGREC entries. Use information from
those two sources and from the Problem Determination section of this code to resolve the problem. If you suspect an
error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem,
see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: The abend code can be issued by any of the RDS modules. The module name can be found
in the SQLCA. SQLERRD1 in the SQLCA contains a unique code that identifies the location within the module where
the error was detected. SQLERRM might contain some meaningful information for this particular error.
For information about how to find the SQLCA, see DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.

00E70009
Explanation: An invalid value or a return code(EXPLRC1) of 12 was returned by the Access Control Authorization
exit routine, DSNX@XAC.
System action: The authorization check is abended. An SVC dump is requested by DB2 functional recovery. If
EXPLRC1=12, then the Access Control Authorization exit routine is no longer invoked and authorization checking is
performed by DB2.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If message DSNX210I has been issued to the System Console, retrieve the return
code (EXPLRC1) and reason code (EXPLRC2) from this message and refer to the exit routine's documentation to
determine the course of action to be taken.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: The abend with this reason code is issued because the access control authorization exit
routine returned an invalid value in one of the return fields or returned a return code (EXPLRC1) of 12. The register
contents at the time of abend are set as follows:
v Register 3 points to the field that has the invalid value. This field may be in the EXPL or XAPL control block. The
control block eye catcher will enable you to distinguish between the two.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).

Explanation: The application program supplied an invalid address.
System action: The application program abends.
Operator response: Notify the user or system programmer.
System programmer response: Assist the user in determining the invalid address.
User response: Correct the invalid address. See Problem Determination for instructions on how to determine the
failing SQL statement and the bad address. Use this information to determine the application's incorrect setting of the
address.
Problem determination: At the time of abend the register contents are:
R2 A decimal code identifying the bad data:
1 (1) The bad FRB address used to locate the FRBPARM.
2 (2) FRBPARM has the bad address used to locate the RDIIN.
3 (3) RDIVPARM has the bad address used to locate the SQLDA length.

14 (E) RDIAUXPA has the bad address used to locate the SQLD.
15 (F) RDIAUXPA has the bad address used to locate the SQLVAR.
16 (10) PVINFO has the bad address used to locate the indicator variable.
17 (11) PVDPTR has the bad address used to locate the data variable.
18 (12) PVDPTR has the bad address used to locate the data variable.
19 (13) PVDPTR has the bad address used to locate the data variable.
R3 The bad data address.
R4 The length of the data.
R5 The key of the data.
R8 If register 2 = 8 or 9, R8 contains the address of the RDIVPARM. If register 2 = 16 or 17, R8 contains the
address of the RDIAUXPA. Otherwise, R8 contains the address of the RDIIN. This is the application's
invocation parameter list. The address of the RDIIN may not be valid if the RDIIN could not be located
(Register 2 = 1 or 2).
The program name identifies the failing program. The statement number refers to the statement number in the DB2
precompiler listing. The SQL statement executed can then be found in the application program's compiler/assembler
listing. For example, if the statement number is X'00E6', refer to statement number 230 in the DB2 precompiler listing.
This precompiler statement number can be cross-referenced to the program's compiler/assembler listing.

to a new execution unit and the new execution unit abended.
System action: The calling execution unit is also abended.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer. Print SYS1.LOGREC. Also print the dump from any previous
dump data set if the failing module name is DSNXACKP or the dump title is 'RDS AUTHCHK'.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
See problem determination. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and
Reference.
Problem determination: The module issuing this abend reason code has invoked the DSNXCHK macro to perform
an authorization check for either the application plan or the command authorization. The DSNXCHK macro does a
cross-memory execution unit switch to module DSNXACKP. Look for a previous dump in which the failing module
name is DSNXACKP, the dump title is RDS AUTHCHK, or the failure is an allocation failure.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00E70012
Explanation: A user exit has written beyond the end of the output buffer.
System action: The application program abends.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Correct the exit routine. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the
problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2
Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: At the time of abend the register contents are:
v R2 contains the first 4 characters of the exit routine name.
v R3 contains the next 4 characters of the exit routine name.
If the exit routine name is DSNXVDTX then DECPDLEN contains the LOCAL DATE LENGTH specified on the DB2
Installation Application Programming Defaults Panel. The exit routine wrote beyond this length in returning a local
date format to DB2.
If the exit routine name is DSNXVTMX then DECPTLEN contains the LOCAL DATE LENGTH specified on the DB2
Installation Application Programming Defaults Panel. The exit routine wrote beyond this length in returning a local
time format to DB2.
00E70013
Explanation: DRDS at the server site supplied an invalid address.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC and an SVC dump is requested.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: This is a DB2 internal error.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v Listing of the results produced by the SQL statements.
00E70014
Explanation: DB2 could not validate the data definition control support tables during startup.
System action: The requested operation is not performed.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Provide a print of the SVC dump to the system programmer. Use the information in
the 'Problem Determination' section. The data definition control support tables could not be validated. No data
definition SQL statements can be executed until these tables can be validated.
Register 2 contains the address of a message that indicates the reason for the problem. DB2 startup continues. Correct
the problem if it still exists. DB2 will attempt to validate the data definition control support tables when the user
attempts to execute any data definition SQL statements.
Collect the following diagnostic item listed in
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v Listing of the results produced by the SQL statements.
00E70015
Explanation: DB2 was abnormally terminated because the Access Control Authorization exit has indicated that it is
unable to process authorization checks and that DB2 should be terminated.
System action: The authorization check task is abended. An SVC dump is requested by DB2 functional recovery. A
message is issued to the operator console, and DB2 is terminated.
System programmer response: Use the information in the 'Problem Determination' section of this message to
resolve the problem.
Problem determination: Locate operator console message DSNX210I. This message has the return and reason codes
from the exit. Since the Access Control Authorization exit (DSNX@XAC) is external to DB2, you will need to refer to
its documentation for an explanation of these codes and a resolution to the problem.
00E70016
Explanation: DB2 terminated abnormally because the version of the Access Control Authorization exit routine
(DSNX@XAC) is incompatible with this version of DB2.
System action: The access control authorization exit initialization task terminated abnormally. An SVC dump is
requested by DB2 functional recovery, message DSNX210I is issued to the operator console and DB2 is terminated.
System programmer response: Install the version of the access control authorization exit routine compatible with
this level of DB2 and restart DB2.

00E70020
Explanation: The table name is specified using a LIKE predicate for the audit policy in the
SYSIBM.SYSAUDITPOLICIES table. More than one table name match the specified LIKE predicate and at least one of
these tables is not defined in the supported table space types. Only the following table space types are supported for
auditing:
v Universal table spaces
v Traditional partitioned table spaces
v Segmented table spaces
System action: The audit policy is started, but the table defined in the unsupported table space is not audited.
This reason code is in the IFCID 0362 trace record.
System programmer response: To identify the tables that are not being audited, join the
SYSIBM.SYSAUDITPOLICIES, SYSIBM.SYSTABLES, and SYSIBM.SYSTABLESPACE tables on the basis of the table
name (OBJECTSCHEMA and OBJECTNAME values from SYSIBM.SYSAUDITPOLICIES), excluding supported table
space types.

00E70021
Explanation: Either the specified audit policy is not defined or an attempt was made to use it before new-function
mode has been enabled.
System action: The audit policy is not started.
System programmer response: Verify that the audit policy is defined and that the system is in new-function mode.
If the policy has not been defined, define it and then start it. If the system is not in new-function mode yet, delay
running the program until the system enters new-function mode.
00E70022
Explanation: Either no category is specified for the audit policy or the specified category value is invalid for the
audit policy.
System action: The audit policy is not started.
This reason code is in the IFCID 0362 trace record.
System programmer response: If no category is defined, specify at least one category for the audit policy.
If the category value is invalid, correct the category value for the specified audit policy:
COLLID
Specify that PACKADM authority is to be audited.
DBNAME
Specify that DBCTRL, DBADM, or DBMAINT authority is to be audited.
If the length of the DBNAME value is greater than 8, correct the length to 8 characters or fewer.
Specify the correct values and then start the audit policy.

Explanation: One of the following conditions has occurred:
v The required object schema or object name is not specified for the OBJMAINT or EXECUTE category in the audit
policy.
v The object type specified in the audit policy is not valid. The valid object types are table, alias on a table, clone
table and implicit table created for XML columns.
System action: The audit policy is not started.
This reason code is in the IFCID 0362 trace record.
System programmer response: The object schema and object name are required for categories OBJMAINT and
EXECUTE. If the object schema or object name is not specified, then specify the object schema or object name and
start the audit policy.
If the object type is not valid, specify the correct value and start the audit policy.

v Traditional partitioned table spaces
v Segmented table spaces
System action: The audit policy is not started.
This reason code is in the IFCID 0362 trace record.
System programmer response: To identify the tables that are not being audited, join the
SYSIBM.SYSAUDITPOLICIES, SYSIBM.SYSTABLES and SYSIBM.SYSTABLESPACE tables on the basis of the table
name (OBJECTSCHEMA and OBJECTNAME values from SYSIBM.SYSAUDITPOLICIES), excluding supported table
space types.

00E70069
Explanation: An installation error was detected while the CICS Attachment Facility was attempting to establish the
connection to DB2 for your CICS transaction. This error can be caused by the following situations:
v The current CICS transaction identifier was not found in any of the resource control table (RCT) entries.
v A valid authorization name was not found using the RCT entry for this CICS transaction. The AUTH= parameter
in the RCT specifies up to three sources for authorization checking. None of these yielded a valid name for
checking. For example, the RACF group might have been specified, but the user was not a member of any RACF
group. Or terminal identifier might have been specified, but the transaction was being run without a terminal.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: Check the RCT table specifications for this transaction to determine if they are
missing or incorrect. If modification is needed, change the RCT source and install the RCT again.
Problem determination: You might be able to use the DSNC DISPLAY command to check for the existence of an
RCT entry for this transaction. If an entry exists, refer to the RCT source. Look at the AUTH= parameter list and
determine why CICS was unable to establish a valid authorization name for checking.

00E7006A
Explanation: While processing your request, the IMS Attachment Facility could not identify the DB2 subsystem. The
DB2 identification must be defined to the IMS control region, the DL/I batch region, and any dependent region
accessing the DB2 subsystem.
System action: The connection is not established.
System programmer response: To make the identification to the IMS regions, you must create a subsystem member
(SSM) in the IMSVS.PROCLIB library and identify the SSM to the applicable IMS regions.

00E7006B
Explanation: The CICS or IMS Attachment Facility detected that a shutdown was in progress for the DB2 subsystem
while processing your request. This might occur during initial connection processing or during subsequent requests,
depending on the type of DB2 shutdown.
System action: The connection is not established.
Operator response: Restart the DB2 subsystem.
User response: Before you can continue, you must restart the DB2 subsystem. Contact the operator to restart the
subsystem, and then resubmit your transaction.
00E70081
Explanation: An SQL statement was issued, but the object that was referenced by the statement cannot be created,
altered, renamed, or dropped. The object is referenced by a prepared dynamic SQL statement that is currently stored
in the prepared statement cache and is in use by an application.
System action: The requested operation is not performed.
Programmer response: The requested operation cannot be performed until other applications are not referencing the
object by using dynamic SQL. Invalidating a cached statement that references the object by using RUNSTATS does
not accomplish this task.
Instead, ensure that other applications have quiesced or performed a commit operation. Then, try the request again.
You can also increase the value of the DDLTOX subsystem parameter so that the statement can wait longer while
other applications that reference the object quiesce or perform a commit operation.
Problem determination: An SQLCODE -904 is issued. The message tokens for that message report the name and
type of the object that was referenced .

00E70082
Explanation: The user has reached the maximum number of outstanding stored procedures or opened cursors for
the current thread.
System action: No additional stored procedures may be invoked, and no more cursors are allowed to be opened.
Programmer response: Applications should close cursors as soon as possible, and should issue COMMIT often to
allow the stored procedure result set to be cleared.
00E7009A
Explanation: A DECLARE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE statement or OPEN CURSOR (of a scrollable cursor) was
issued, but the operation cannot be performed due to one of the following reasons:
v A work file database has not been created yet.
v A table space has not been created in the work file database yet.
v No table space in the work file database has a page size that is large enough for the declared global temporary
table.
v A table space in the work file database is not available at this time.
System action: The operation is not allowed.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: To perform the operation, you must create the required work file database or create
a table space with a large enough page size.
Problem determination: The requested operation is not performed. An SQLCODE -904 is issued.

00E7009B
Explanation: An invalid operation has been attempted on an incomplete table that was created in a previous release
of DB2. The table definition is incomplete due to a missing unique index on a primary key or unique key.
The following DDL operations are not allowed:
v ALTER TABLE
v CREATE INDEX
v DROP INDEX
System action: DB2 does not process the operation.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: In order to perform the operation on the object, you must use the release of DB2 in
which the table was created.
Problem determination: DB2 does not perform the requested operation, and issues SQLCODE -904. For more
information, refer to Part 1, ¡°SQL codes,¡± on page 1.
00E7009C
Explanation: An attempt was made to execute a statement that depends on an unavailable catalog object. The
catalog object will be available after the catalog is updated to the necessary level.
System action: The operation is not allowed.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: To perform the operation, you must update the catalog to the required level. To do
this, run installation job DSNTIJTC.
Problem determination: The requested operation is not performed. SQLCODE -904 and message DSNT501I are
issued.

00E7009E
Explanation: The object is dependent on facilities of a release of DB2 that is newer than the release that you are
currently running (fall back).
System action: The operation is not allowed.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: In order to perform the operation on the object, you must use the release of DB2 that
supports the new facilities.
Problem determination: The requested operation is not performed. An SQLCODE -904 and/or message DSNT501I
is issued. Message DSNT501I describes which object has the release dependency.
00E7009F
Explanation: An error occurred while loading the catalog DBD during start-up processing.

Explanation: DB2 detected internal inconsistency while processing a call to Preinitialized Language Environment for
Authorized Programs.
System action: The application program abends.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer. Print SYS1.LOGREC.
System programmer response: If the location of the abend is DSNXGRDS.DSNXLEII:P005, the unexpected return
code and reason code were returned to DB2 from the Preinitialized Language Environment for Authorized Programs,
which usually indicates a setup error. Check whether recent changes to the z/OS environment (such as the REGION
size or LE library location, among others) might have affected the operation of DB2 and the Preinitialized Language
Environment for Authorized Programs.
If the abend was in a different location, it was likely caused by an internal DB2 consistency.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.

Operator response: For Communication failure, refer to DSNL500I message.
System programmer response: Diagnose the failure that left the user application in an unconnected state. See
¡°Problem Determination¡± section below.
User response: A previous failure has left your application in an unconnected state . Notify the system programmer
that a system failure occurred during execution of your application. Any changes made in the last unit of work is
rolled back. Re-run your application after determining the state of the Current Server database.
Problem determination: Refer to the previous SQL error in the application.
00E70115
Explanation: The unit of work was placed in a state where a rollback operation is required. This can happen when
an abend occurs during the execution of a stored procedure, a user defined function (UDF), or a restricted SQL
operation was issued from a stored procedure.
System action: In the IMS and CICS environments, all SQL statements are rejected until the rollback occurs. In the
other environments, all SQL statements other than a static ROLLBACK are rejected until a static ROLLBACK is
executed.
Programmer response: Correct the stored procedure or UDF, rebind it and resubmit the calling application.
00E70121
Explanation: User ID, password not valid in an IMS or CICS environment. An SQL CONNECT with user ID,
password was issued from an IMS or CICS application.
System action: The SQL CONNECT request is not processed. The application is placed in the connectable and
unconnected state.
00E70122
Explanation: The user ID or password submitted on a request to CONNECT to the local DB2 exceeded the
maximum length supported. The maximum length for each is 8 characters.
System action: The SQL CONNECT request was not processed. The application is placed in the connectable and
unconnected state.
00E70123
Explanation: A stored procedure was terminated because an ASUTIME threshold was exceeded.
System action: The CALL statement is terminated and DB2 returns an SQLCODE -905 to the calling application
unless the stored procedure is called, and interrupted, at a DB2 z/OS server related system and the connection with
the remote client system is via SNA.

Explanation: The SQL statement or utility could not be executed because the required level of z/OS is not installed.
System action: For an SQL statement, the statement is rejected with SQLCODE -20101 and this reason code. For a
utility, the utility is rejected with message DSNT500I and this reason code.
System programmer response: Refer to the Program Directory to determine the minimum level of z/OS that is
required for the syntax used in the statement or utility.
00E73002
Explanation: The SQL statement could not be executed because of a resource unavailable condition. The resource is
Language Environment.
System action: The SQL statement is rejected with SQLCODE -20101 and this reason code.
System programmer response: Refer to the system console for preceding errors. Correct the cause of these errors
and restart the DB2 subsystem.
00E73003
Explanation: The SQL statement could not be executed because the statement needed a level/feature of OS/390 that
is not installed. DB2 attempted to load a required Language Environment load module and was unable to do so.
System action: The SQL statement is rejected with SQLCODE -20101 and this reason code.
System programmer response: Refer to the Program Directory to determine the minimum level of OS/390 that is
required for the syntax used in the statement.
00E73004
Explanation: The SQL statement could not be executed because of a resource unavailable condition. The resource
was an LE token.
System action: The SQL statement is rejected with SQLCODE -20101 and this reason code.
System programmer response: Refer to the system console for preceding errors. Confirm that the zparm keyword
LEMAX is greater than zero. If the problem is persistent, consider increasing the number of LE tokens that the DB2
subsystem is allowed to create. See the Installation Guide for more information on LE tokens.
00E73005
Explanation: The SQL statement or utility operation could not be completed because a hardware resource is not
available.
System action: The SQL statement is rejected with SQLCODE -20107 or the utility issues message DSNT500I and
terminates.
System programmer response: Examine the -20107 or DSNT500I message to identify the type of hardware resource
that is not available. Refer to DB2 Program Directory, GI10-8182 to determine the minimum level of hardware support
that is needed for the syntax used in the statement or utility.
00E73006
Explanation: The SQL statement could not be completed because a functional requisite is not available.
System action: The requested operation is not performed, and SQLCODE -904 is returned with this reason code.
System programmer response: Examine the information returned with SQLCODE -904 to identify the type of
resource that is not available.
If ICSF was the unavailable resource, review the DB2 system console for possible DSNX211I messages during DB2
startup for additional problem determination.
Problem determination: Refer to the Program Directory to determine the minimum functional requisite that is
needed for the syntax used in the statement.
00E79000
Explanation: DB2 received an SQL CALL statement for a stored procedure. The CALL statement was not accepted
because one or more columns of the SYSIBM.SYSROUTINES catalog table for the procedure contains invalid values.
System action: The statement cannot be executed. A DSNX9xx message is displayed on the MVS system console to
describe the error that was detected.
Programmer response: Use ALTER PROCEDURE or ALTER FUNCTION to correct the invalid column values in the
SYSIBM.SYSROUTINES table.
00E79001
Explanation: DB2 received an SQL CALL statement for a stored procedure or an SQL statement containing an
invocation of a user-defined function. The statement was not accepted because the routine was stopped. Possible
reasons are:
v the STOP PROCEDURE ACTION(REJECT) command was issued for this procedure, or
v the STOP FUNCTION ACTION(REJECT) command was issued for this user-defined function, or
v there was a previous abnormal termination of the routine.
System action: The statement cannot be executed.
Programmer response: If the user-written routine was stopped by an abnormal termination, correct the cause of the
abnormal termination.
Use the -START PROCEDURE command to activate the stored procedure.
Use the -START FUNCTION command to activate the user-defined function.
Problem determination:
00E79002
Explanation: DB2 received an SQL CALL statement for a stored procedure or an SQL statement containing an
invocation of a user-defined function. The statement was not accepted because the procedure could not be scheduled
before the installation-defined time limit expired. This can happen for any of the following reasons:
v The DB2 STOP PROCEDURE(name) or STOP FUNCTION SPECIFIC command was in effect. When this command
is in effect, a user-written routine cannot be scheduled until a DB2 START PROCEDURE or START FUNCTION
SPECIFIC command is issued.
v The dispatching priority assigned by WLM to the caller of the user-written routine was low, which resulted in
WLM not assigning the request to a TCB in a WLM-established stored procedure address space before the
installation-defined time limit expired.
v The WLM application environment is quiesced so WLM will not assign the request to a WLM-established stored
procedure address space.
System action: The statement cannot be executed.
Programmer response: If the routine was stopped, use the DB2 -START PROCEDURE or -START FUNCTION
command to activate the user-written routine.
The cause of the timeout condition might be one of the following situations:
v If goal mode is being used to manage the number of WLM-established stored procedure address spaces, the
dispatching priority assigned to the caller of the stored procedure might be too low. If the work is of low priority,
WLM might leave it queued for a longer period of time.
v The WLM application environment is quiesced. Issue MVS DISPLAY WLM,APPLENV=wlmenv command to verify
the status of the application environment. The MVS VARY WLM,APPLENV=wlmenv command can be used to
activate the environment if it is quiesced.
00E79004
Explanation: DB2 received an SQL CALL statement for a stored procedure. The stored procedure could not be
accepted, because the stored procedures address space is not active. The stored procedures address is not active if
START DB2 ACCESS (MAINT) is specified or, START DB2 LIGHT (YES) is specified.
System action: The statement cannot be executed.
Programmer response: Re-invoke the routine once DB2 has been started without ACCESS(MAINT) or LIGHT(YES).
Problem determination:
00E79006
Explanation: DB2 received an SQL CALL statement for a stored procedure or an SQL statement containing an
invocation of a user-defined function. The statement cannot be accepted, because the load module for the
user-created routine is not compatible with Language Environment preinitialization environment.
System action: The SQL CALL statement is rejected with SQLCODE -471 and this reason code.
Programmer response: Ensure the routine is compiled with a level of the compiler which generates a module that
can be a target of a Language Environment preinitialization CEEPIPI call. Ensure that the routine is link edited with
the Language Environment runtime library.
Verify that the user-written routine is described correctly in SYSIBM.SYSROUTINES as a main or sub program. This
failure can occur if the procedure options for the stored procedure indicate it is a sub program and the specification
in the catalog indicates it is a main program.
Message DSNX962I will also be displayed on the MVS system console. This message indicates the specific Language
Environment preinitialization service that failed and the failing return code.

00E79007
Explanation: An attempt to call a DB2 stored procedure or UDF invocation failed because the host language
specified in the LANGUAGE clause of CREATE PROCEDURE or CREATE FUNCTION did not match the language
reported by Language Environment.
System action: The attempt to call the stored procedure fails, and the procedure is marked STOP-REJ.
System programmer response: Use the ALTER FUNCTION or ALTER PROCEDURE statement to correct the
LANGUAGE attribute specified for the user-defined function or procedure.
00E79008
Explanation: The SQL CALL statement could not be processed. The SECURITY attribute of the user-defined function
or procedure requested that a specific security environment be established. An error occurred while attempting to
establish this security environment.
System action: The SQL CALL statement is rejected with SQLCODE -471 and this reason code.
System programmer response: Additional error messages might have been generated by the external security
product to describe the error. Use the ALTER FUNCTION or ALTER PROCEDURE statement to modify the
SECURITY attribute specified for the user-defined function or procedure.
00E7900A
Explanation: A stored procedure defined as NO WLM ENVIRONMENT was invoked. Execution in the
DB2-managed stored procedures address space (SPAS) is no longer supported.
System action: The SQL CALL statement is rejected with SQLCODE -471 and this reason code.
Programmer response: Use ALTER PROCEDURE to modify the definition of the stored procedure to specify a valid
WLM ENVIRONMENT. If the stored procedure accesses DB2, the load module identified in EXTERNAL NAME must
be link edited with RRS attach (DSNRLI).
00E7900B
Explanation: The SQL CALL statement could not be processed. DB2 determined that the user-defined function or
procedure was to be run in a specific WLM-established address space, but the necessary WLM services are not
available.
The user-defined function or procedure specified a non-blank WLM ENVIRONMENT attribute.
System action: The SQL CALL statement is rejected with SQLCODE -471 and this reason code.
System programmer response: Issue the START FUNCTION SPECIFIC or START PROCEDURE command to allow
the altered user-defined function or procedure to be called.
Programmer response: Use the ALTER FUNCTION or ALTER PROCEDURE statement to modify the WLM
ENVIRONMENT attribute specified for the user-defined function or procedure, or specify the NO WLM
ENVIRONMENT clause.
00E7900C
Explanation: SQL CALL statement or user-defined function invocation could not be processed. The WLM
application environment name specified for the user-written routine is not defined or is currently not available for
DB2 use in the active WLM policy.
System action: The SQL statement is rejected with SQLCODE -471 and this reason code.
Programmer response: Use the -ALTER PROCEDURE or -ALTER FUNCTION command to update the WLM
ENVIRONMENT to specify an application environment that is defined and active in the active WLM policy, or
update the WLM policy to contain a valid application environment name.
If the WLM policy definition is updated, use the MVS WLM VARY command to activate this new definition.
If the WLM application environment is quiesced, use the MVS WLM VARY APPLENV= applenv, RESUME command
to activate the application environment.
00E7900F
Explanation: Insufficient storage space available for the parameter list to a user-defined function or stored
procedure. This error is caused by a single parameter or a group of parameters requiring more contiguous storage
than DB2 can obtain.
System action: The SQL statement is rejected with SQLCODE -904 and this reason code.
Programmer response: Validate the length of each parameter.
If LOBs are being used, consider using LOB locators instead.
00E79010
Explanation: DB2 received an SQL CALL statement for a stored procedure. The CALL statement was not accepted
because one or more columns of the SYSIBM.SYSROUTINES catalog table for the procedure contains invalid values.
The value of the column was valid in a prior release of DB2, but is invalid in this release of DB2.
Possible reasons for this include a LANGUAGE column with value COMPJAVA.
System action: The statement cannot be performed. SQLCODE -471 is returned on the SQL CALL statement with
this reason code.
Programmer response: Use ALTER PROCEDURE to correct the invalid column in the SYSIBM.SYSROUTINES
catalog table.
To migrate a LANGUAGE COMPJAVA stored procedure to LANGUAGE JAVA, use the following procedure:
1. Ensure that you have a WLM application environment that has been set up to run LANGUAGE JAVA.
2. Put the .class file containing the stored procedure code into a directory that is identified in CLASSPATH in the
JAVAENV for your LANGUAGE JAVA WLM application environment. Alternatively, you may put the .class file
into a Java JAR file and invoke the SQLJ.INSTALL_JAR built-in stored procedure.
3. Issue an ALTER PROCEDURE command against the stored procedure that specifies LANGUAGE JAVA and WLM
ENVIRONMENT java applenv.
00E79100

00E79102
Explanation: An error occurred while attempting a Java Native Interface function to invoke a Java stored procedure.
System action: The SQL CALL statement fails with SQLCODE -471 and reason code 00E79102.
Programmer response: Check the operator console for message DSNX961I. This message contains information about
the Java error.
00E79106
Explanation: DB2 could not process an SQL CALL statement for a REXX stored procedure. There were errors
associated in setting up an environment to run a REXX stored procedure. See the system console for the associated
DSNX993I message.
System action: The SQL statement fails with this reason code and SQLCODE -471.
Programmer response: Use the information provided in the DSNX993I message, and the TSO and REXX messages
in ddname SYSTSPRT for diagnosis. You can find TSO and REXX message explanations in z/OS TSO/E Messages and
z/OS TSO/E REXX Reference.
00E79109
Explanation: A routine was defined to run in a WLM application environment that was not set up correctly for the
language that was specified.
Java routines must be run in a WLM application environment that has been set up to run Java routines. This
application environment cannot be used to run non-Java routines.
System action: The SQL CALL statement SQLCODE -471 and this reason code.
System programmer response: Use the ALTER PROCEDURE statement if you need to change the WLM application
environment.
To set up a WLM application environment to run LANGUAGE JAVA routines, add a JAVAENV DD statement to the
startup procedure for the stored procedure address space. The JAVAENV DD statement specifies a data set that
contains environment variables for running Java routines.
Programmer response: Contact the system programmer
00E7910A
Explanation: Insufficient storage space available for Native SQL PL debugging. This error can be caused by symbol
data that requires more contiguous storage than the SQL PL debug agent can obtain in the WLM managed DB2
SPAS.
System action: SQLCODE -904 is returned to the user with this reason code.
Programmer response: Refresh the WLM ENVIRONMENT FOR DEBUG MODE. Reduce the number of concurrent
tasks permitted in the WLM Environment. Consider using fewer variables and shorter variable names in the SQL PL
routine.
00E7910D
Explanation: The storage required for the dynamic statement cache exceeded the limit set in the
CACHE_DEP_TRACK_STOR_LIM subsystem parameter.
System action: SQLCODE -904 is returned with this reason code.
System programmer response: Increase the value of the CACHE_DEP_TRACK_STOR_LIM subsystem parameter.

00E79200
Explanation: A Control Center 390 stored procedure encountered an unexpected abnormal termination or error
condition.
System action: The Control Center 390 stored procedure terminates, and returns a failing return code to the calling
application. The Control Center 390 stored procedure retries from the abnormal termination, so DB2 will not detect
that the stored procedure has abnormally terminated. The count of abnormal terminations maintained by DB2 will
not be incremented for this abnormal termination.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in Control Center 390, contact IBM support.
Problem determination: The error is recorded on SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested.
00E79201
Explanation: DB2 received an SQL statement containing an invocation of a user-defined function. The statement was
not accepted because of a prior failing invocation of the user-defined function from the application. The prior failing
invocation left the DB2 structures for the user-defined function task in an unusable state.
System action: The statement cannot be executed. SQLCODE -471 is returned with this reason code. If the
user-defined function was defined with FINAL CALL YES, then it will be invoked at final call processing time.
Programmer response: Correct the error in the user-defined function program that caused the prior invocation to
fail. Modify the invoking application so that it does not continue to invoke the user-defined function after a negative
SQLCODE is issued.
00E79300
Explanation: Table creation has failed because DB2 cannot implicitly create a database, or cannot choose an existing
available database with naming convention DSNxxxxx. The DSNxxxx value can range from DSN00001 to DSNnnnnn,
where nnnnn is the maximum value of the sequence SYSIBM.DSNSEQ_IMPLICITDB, with a default value of 10000.
The cause of this failure is usually:
v A lock timeout exists.
v A deadlock condition exists.
v DB2 was unable to access catalog pages.
v On systems that contain a large number of databases: DB2 might have run out of resources to implicitly create a
new database.
System action: The CREATE TABLE statement fails.
System programmer response: Use the GET DIAGNOSTICS statement to obtain information about the error
conditions that have occurred. Analyze the error conditions to determine whether follow-up actions are necessary. If
you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting
the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of DB2 log output.
v Listing of the results produced by the SQL statements.

Explanation: An error was detected in the command that was used to start the DB2 subsystem. There are two
conditions that can cause this error. If the -START DB2 command is in error, this abend results.
Secondly, if the DB2 subsystem is not running (had never been started, or had been stopped), any DB2 command that
is entered is interpreted as being a -START DB2 command. In this second case, the subsystem starts just long enough
to discover that the command actually is not a -START DB2 command and then issues the abend.
System action: The DB2 subsystem is terminated.
Operator response: Reenter the command if it was entered in error; otherwise advise the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis

information: bytes 1 through 8, the name of the load module that contains the initialization entry point list with the
invalid entry; bytes 9 through 12, and the entry number of the initialization entry point list entry. Probable cause is
that the initialization entry point list entry defines an invalid module entry point or defines a valid entry point for a
module that has not been included in the loaded module.

Problem determination: See message DSNY010I.
00E80162
Explanation: The DSNHDECP module supplied by DB2 is being used to start DB2. DB2 requires site-dependent
settings that are specified in the DSNHDECP module that was created when DB2 was installed. The
installation-generated DSNHDECP module typically resides in the SDSNEXIT library.
System action: The DB2 subsystem is not started.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: See message DSNT527I.
00E80163
Explanation: A DB2 subsystem could not start because the DB2 ERLY code was not at the correct level for the
version of that DB2 subsystem.
System action: DB2 startup abnormally terminates.
System programmer response: To solve the problem, follow these steps:
1. Verify that you are specifying the correct prefix.SDSNLINK library in your link list. If not, correct the library
name.
2. Install a version of the DB2 ERLY code that is compatible with the DB2 version that you are starting.
See Choosing link list options (DB2 Installation and Migration) for information about compatibility of ERLY code
levels and DB2 versions.

Explanation: You requested a facility that was not loaded or started at the time DB2 started. Whether or not to load
or start a facility is contained in the DSN6FAC member in ZPARMS.
This reason code is returned to the calling CSECTs by DSNYNFAC along with a return code of 8.
This is not an error in DSNYNFAC. If an error exists, it might be in the calling CSECT or in the DSN6FAC member
in ZPARMS.
System action: This is determined by the caller of DSNYNFAC.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If it can be determined that DSN6FAC is in error, assemble DSN6FAC with
corrections and re-link-edit the DSNZPARM load module.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.

00E90101
Explanation: This reason code is issued when a DB2 directory cannot be opened. This is probably a DB2 subsystem
error.
This abend reason code is issued by the module identified in the SYS1.LOGREC entry for this abend code.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Obtain a print of SYS1.LOGREC and the SVC dump.
Problem determination: This abend results when any one of a number of DB2 internal directories cannot be
opened. One customer-usable directory can also cause this abend if it cannot be opened. This is the DSNZPARM
directory that is established at installation.
This directory may have a name different from that specified at installation, because the customer has the option of
changing the name during installation. Ensure that the DSNZPARM directory (or its equivalent) is available to be
opened.
If the DSNZPARM directory (or its equivalent) is available, the problem is a DB2 subsystem problem. If you suspect
an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem,
see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
This abend is intercepted by an FRR or ESTAE for the subcomponent or module that issued the DSNZOPEN request.

00E90202
Explanation: An error was found in the directory control information for a DB2 directory.
System action: A record is written to SYS1.LOGREC, and an SVC dump is requested.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Obtain a print of SYS1.LOGREC and the SVC dump.
Problem determination: This abend results when incorrect control information is found for any one of a number of
DB2 internal directories. One customer-usable directory can also cause this abend: the DSNZPARM directory that is
established during installation. (This directory might have had a different name specified during installation.) Ensure
that the DSNZPARM directory or its equivalent is available.
If the DSNZPARM directory or its equivalent is available, the problem is a DB2 subsystem problem. If you suspect an
error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and reporting the problem,
see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.

Explanation: This reason code may be returned to subsystem-type recovery coordinators when they connect to DB2
or during processing of indoubt threads to inform the coordinator that further recovery coordination actions are
required.
This reason code is not normally visible to users or operators, but may appear in DB2 traces.
System action: Processing continues.
00F30002
Explanation: The requested DB2 subsystem, as specified by the subsystem name, is not active. The option to notify
the requester, either via an ECB post or a SEND/MODIFY MVS command, is accepted.
System action: The request to notify the caller when the subsystem is active is queued for processing during
subsystem startup.
User response: Retry the connection request after DB2 has been started.
00F30003
Explanation: An abend has occurred during an attempt to access or modify the caller-provided function request
block (FRB) while executing in the caller's PSW key.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: See Problem Determination.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: This reason code is placed in register 15 during any access to an attachment-provided
function request block (FRB). A subsequent X'0Cx' abend indicates an FRB addressability problem. This abend is
probably the result of a logic error in the attachment facility.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v All dumps taken by the attachment facility or requesting application.
00F30004
Explanation: An abend has occurred during an attempt to access the attachment-provided parameter list while
executing in the caller's PSW key.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: See Problem Determination.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: This reason code is placed in register 15 during any access to an attachment-provided
parameter list. A subsequent X'0Cx' abend indicates a parameter addressability problem.
This abend is probably the result of a logic error in the attachment facility. For call attachment users, the abend may
have been caused by a bad parameter address passed to call attachment.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v All dumps taken by the attachment facility or requesting application.
00F30005
Explanation: An error was detected during processing of a request to establish or delete a 'termination ECB'. Either
a parameter value was incorrect or an abend occurred while accessing the attachment-provided parameter list.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: See Problem Determination.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: For the nonabend case, either the ECB address was zero or the Request Code was not
'Establish' or 'Delete'. If the reason code is in register 15 on an abend, either the parameter list or a parameter value
was not addressable in the caller's PSW key.
The error may be the result of an internal error in the attachment facility. Call attachment users should check that the
supplied ECB address is not zero and that it is addressable in their PSW key.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v All dumps taken by the attachment facility or requesting application.
00F30006
Explanation: A failure occurred while processing the 'Subsystem Name' during connection processing. In the abend
case, connection processing failed when accessing the 'Subsystem Name' in the caller's PSW key. In the nonabend
case, MVS was unable to locate a DB2 subsystem with the specified name.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: See Problem Determination.
User response: A dump should be taken in your recovery routine for abend analysis. If the named subsystem could
not be found, verify that the correct subsystem name was specified. Call attachment users should note that the
Translate function cannot be invoked for this reason code.
Problem determination: If the named subsystem could not be found, scan the MVS system log to verify that it was
initialized during MVS IPL processing.
If this reason code was specified in register 15 on an abend, check that the subsystem name value is addressable in
the caller's PSW key.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v All dumps taken by the attachment facility or requesting application.
00F30007
Explanation: A failure occurred while processing the 'Connection Type' parameter during connection processing.
Either the 'Connection Type' value was invalid or an abend occurred accessing the parameter using the caller's PSW
key.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: See Problem Determination.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: For the abend case, this reason code is placed in register 15 to identify which parameter
was not addressable in the caller's PSW key. This failure is probably the result of a logic error in the attachment
facility.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v All dumps taken by the attachment facility or requesting application.
00F30008
Explanation: A failure occurred while processing the 'Notify Message/Startup ECB' parameter during connection
processing. An abend occurs while accessing the parameter or while verifying that the ECB word was addressable in
the caller's PSW key. In the nonabend case, either the parameter had a zero length or the supplied ECB address was
zero.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: See Problem Determination.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: For the abend case, this reason code is placed in register 15 to identify which parameter
was not addressable in the caller's PSW key. The failure may be due to a logic error in the attachment facility. Call
attachment users should verify that the Startup ECB address is nonzero and that the ECB word is addressable in
their PSW key.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v All dumps taken by the attachment facility or requesting application.
00F30009
Explanation: A request was received to establish a termination ECB, but a termination ECB had already been
established for the connected task.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: Obtain all dumps taken by the attachment facility or invoking application.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: This failure is probably the result of a logic error in the attachment facility.
00F30010
Explanation: A request was received to delete a termination ECB, but a termination ECB has not been established
for the connected task.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: Obtain all dumps taken by the attachment facility or invoking application.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: This failure is probably the result of a logic error in the attachment facility.
00F30011
Explanation: A connection or other work request was received, but the designated DB2 subsystem is not active. If
the request was to connect to the subsystem, and the Notify Message/Startup ECB was supplied, it was not accepted.
In some instances, this code may be reported if the application program issued an RRSAF IDENTIFY function request
and RRS/MVS was not available.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: Obtain all dumps taken by the attachment facility or invoking application.
User response: If the failure occurred on a connection request and a Notify Message/Startup ECB was provided, a
dump should be taken for problem analysis. Reconnect to DB2 when the subsystem is active again.
If RRS/MVS was not available for an RRSAF IDENTITY request, ensure RRS/MVS is active and retry the request.
Problem determination: The Notify Message or Startup ECB could not be accepted for one of two reasons.
v Storage for a buffer could not be obtained, or
v the length of the Message/ECB parameter was zero.
In the latter case, the attachment facility is probably in error. If insufficient storage was available for a buffer, the size
of the CSA in 24-bit storage should be increased.
In some instances, the failure was reported because the application required an RRSAF IDENTITY request and
RRS/MVS was not active. Additional checking is needed when RRS/MVS is involved.
00F30012
Explanation: The requested DB2 subsystem, as specified by the subsystem name, is not active. The option to notify
the requester, either via an ECB post or a SEND/MODIFY MVS command, is accepted, but overlays a previous
Notify Message/Startup ECB request.
System action: The request to notify the caller when the subsystem is active is queued for processing during
subsystem startup.
User response: Retry the connection request after DB2 has been started.
00F30013
Explanation: The requester is not authorized to connect to this DB2 subsystem. This condition might indicate an
attempted security violation.
System action: The connection request is denied.
System programmer response: Examine the console/SYSLOG output for RACF messages issued when a request is
denied. Refer the user to your security administrator if the user should be granted authorization to a DB2 subsystem.
User response: Verify that you have specified the correct RACF authorization ID. If necessary, request authorization
to access the DB2 subsystem from your security administrator.
Problem determination: During TCB connection processing, Subsystem Support invokes the RACROUTE service
(causing a RACF RACHECK) to verify the authorization ID associated with the requester. If the RACF return code
indicates the requester is not authorized to connect to this DB2 subsystem, the connection request is terminated with
this reason code.

00F30014
Explanation: The requester of a Subsystem Support function (for example, ABORT) for a connection is not in the
same PSW key as when the connection was created.
System action: The requester's task is abended with code X'04E'.
System programmer response: See Problem Determination.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: This failure may be the result of a logic error in the attachment facility or an intentional
attempt to violate DB2 connection protocols. The error should be evaluated in the same way as a system X'0C2'
abend, an attempt by a nonprivileged program to perform privileged operations.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v All dumps taken by the attachment facility or requesting application.
00F30015
Explanation: The attachment facility specified an invalid combination of values of FRBRALE and FRBQUAL. No
Program Request Handler exists to service the call.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: Obtain all dumps taken by the attachment facility and requesting application.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: Register 1 contains a pointer to the FRB at the entry to DSNAPRHX. The FRBRALE and
FRBQUAL values in the caller's FRB should be examined to determine which one is in error. Not all combinations of
valid FRBRALE and FRBQUAL values are supported. Each RALE is supported differently.
00F30016
Explanation: The attachment facility specified an invalid FRBRALE value. The value is outside the limits of those
supported for the requesting connection. This can occur in many cases, one of which is when an SQL call is
requested with a blank plan name by the requester.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: Obtain all dumps taken by the attachment facility and requesting application.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: Register 1 contains a pointer to the FRB at the entry to DSNAPRHX. FRBRALE contains
the invalid value that was passed. The value passed is not consistent with the resources allocated to the connected
application.
If the plan name contains blanks, an SQL call is invalid. The requester should respecify the plan name and issue the
request again.
00F30017
Explanation: The attachment facility specified an invalid FRBQUAL value. The value is outside the limits of those
supported for the requesting connection.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: Obtain all dumps taken by the attachment facility and requesting application.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: Register 1 contains a pointer to the FRB at the entry to DSNAPRHX. FRBQUAL contains
the invalid value that was passed. The value passed is not consistent with the resources allocated to the connected
application.
00F30018
Explanation: The requester's TCB is not connected to this instance of the DB2 subsystem. The TCB may have been
connected to a previous instance.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: See Problem Determination.
User response: Request a new connection to DB2.
Problem determination: This error can occur for one of the following reasons:
v The DB2 subsystem has terminated and the connected application issues a DB2 work request without
reestablishing the connection after the subsystem is restarted.
v The connection has been terminated by a CANCEL THREAD command.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v All dumps taken by the attachment facility or requesting application.
00F30019
Explanation: The requester's primary ASID (PASID) is not equal to the home ASID (PSAAOLD).
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: See Problem Determination.
User response: You may want to take a dump for problem analysis. The request may be retried, but first ensure the
CPU is not in cross-memory mode.
Problem determination: No requester of a DB2 attachment facility may be in cross-memory mode. That is, PASID
must equal HASID, which must equal SASID.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v All dumps taken by the attachment facility or requesting application.
00F30020
Explanation: An error was detected while processing the 'Commit Option' on a SSAM termination request. Either
the value of the 'Commit Option' parameter was not valid or an abend occurred when accessing the parameter.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: See Problem Determination.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: For the abend case, this reason code is placed in register 15 to identify which parameter
was not addressable in the caller's PSW key. The failure may be the result of a logic error in the attachment facility.
Call Attachment users should note that only 'SYNC' and 'ABRT' are valid terminate options.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v All dumps taken by the attachment facility or requesting application.
00F30021
Explanation: An attachment facility issued a Subsystem Support request, but provided too few or too many
parameters.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: Obtain all dumps taken by the attachment facility or by the requesting application.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: This failure is probably the result of a logic error in the attachment facility.
Upon entry to each of the CSECTs listed above, register 1 contains the address of the Function Request Block (FRB).
FRBPCNT contains the number of passed parameters and FRBPARM points to a list of parameter addresses. The
required number of parameters is unique to the calling protocol for each CSECT.
00F30022
Explanation: An error was detected while processing the 'Connection Name' for a connection request. Either the
value of the 'Connection Name' parameter was not valid or an abend occurred when accessing the parameter.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: See Problem Determination.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: For the abend case, this reason code is placed in register 15 to identify which parameter
was not addressable in the caller's PSW key. A 'Connection Name' is invalid if it is not a printable string (e.g. binary
zeros). The failure is probably the result of a logic error in the attachment facility.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v All dumps taken by the attachment facility or requesting application.
00F30023
Explanation: This reason code may be returned during connection processing if the connection name is already in
use by another allied address space, but the connection type is different.
This reason code is not normally visible to users or operators, but may appear in DB2 traces. The ally attempting to
connect to DB2 should have produced diagnostic information relating to the connection failure.
System action: The connection request is rejected.
System programmer response: Collect the diagnostics produced by the allied address space which could not
connect to DB2.
Problem determination: Follow the instructions indicated by the diagnostics to assure that a different connection
name will be used on future attempts to connect to DB2.
00F30024
Explanation: The 'connection name' or 'connection type' does not match the name or type established by another
connected task in the address space.
System action: The connection request is denied.
System programmer response: See Problem Determination.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: All tasks within an address space connecting to the same DB2 subsystem must connect
with the same connection name and type. Tasks within TSO and batch address spaces using the 'BATCH' connection
type may specify unequal connection names. The failure is probably the result of a logic error in the attachment
facility.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v All dumps taken by the attachment facility or requesting application.
00F30025
Explanation: A request to establish a DB2 termination ECB has completed successfully; however, DB2 is stopping.
The new termination ECB might not be posted.
System action: Control is returned to the attachment facility.
User response: Since DB2 is stopping, you should attempt to terminate your connection. Next, issue a connect
request and provide a Startup ECB. When the Startup ECB is posted, issue the connect request again to re-establish
your connection to the restarted DB2.
00F30026
Explanation: The attachment facility specified an invalid FRBFVLE value. The value is outside the limits of those
supported for the requesting connection.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: Obtain all dumps taken by the attachment facility and requesting application.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: Register 1 contains a pointer to the FRB at the entry to DSNAPRHX. FRBFVLE contains the
invalid value that was passed. The value passed must not be zero and it must be consistent with the resource
requested by FRBRALE.
00F30027
Explanation: An error occurred while processing the 'Weighting Factor' parameter. This parameter was provided by
the attachment facility on a request to allocate a DB2 plan to the application.
Either an abend occurred accessing the 'Weighting Factor' or the value of the parameter is out of range.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: See Problem Determination.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: For the abend case, this reason code is placed in register 15 to identify which parameter
was not addressable in the caller's PSW key. The value of the 'Weighting Factor' must be a positive number between
zero and 255. The failure is probably the result of a logic error in the attachment facility.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v All dumps taken by the attachment facility or requesting application.
00F30028
Explanation: This reason code is returned when previous invocations of DB2 have set the thread into a state such
that the only acceptable request that can be made for the thread is ABORT. This could occur, for example, if the ally
has issued "Prepare to Commit" and DB2 returned a "No" vote on the call. In this situation, the only acceptable
request for the ally to make is ABORT.
This reason code is not normally visible to users or operators, but may appear in DB2 traces. The ally may have
produced diagnostics to report this condition, or it may handle this condition internally without requiring outside
intervention.
System action: The current allied request is rejected. The state of the thread is unchanged.
System programmer response: Collect any diagnostics produced by the allied address space.
Problem determination: Follow the instructions indicated by the diagnostics, if any.
00F30029
Explanation: This reason code is returned when a COMMIT request is received in an improper context. Either a
PREPARE is required before the COMMIT request, or the connection type does not allow a COMMIT request.
This reason code is not normally visible to users or operators, but may appear in DB2 traces.
System action: The current allied request is rejected. The state of the thread is unchanged.
00F30030
Explanation: An abend has occurred during an attempt to access the caller-provided 'INDOUBT RESOLUTION'
parameter while executing in the PSW key. This is probably the result of a logic error in the requesting program.
System action: The request is not processed.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: This reason code is placed in register 15 during any access to caller-provided information.
When any abend occurs this register indicates which parameter caused the error.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00F30031
Explanation: This reason code is returned when a DEALLOCATE request is received from a CICS or IMS thread,
but PREPARE has already completed for the thread and either COMMIT or ABORT are the only acceptable requests.
This reason code is not normally visible to users or operators, but may appear in DB2 traces.
System action: The current allied request is rejected. The state of the thread is unchanged. The ally issuing the
DEALLOCATE request may have produced diagnostics related to this error.
System programmer response: Collect the diagnostics produced by the allied address space, if any.
Problem determination: Follow the instructions indicated by the diagnostics.
00F30032
Explanation: An error occurred while processing the 'Indoubt Resolution' parameter. This parameter was provided
by the attachment facility on a request to allocate a DB2 plan to the application.
Either an abend occurred accessing the 'Indoubt Resolution' or the value of the parameter is incorrect for this
connection type.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: See Problem Determination.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: For the abend case, this reason code is placed in register 15 to identify which parameter
was not addressable in the caller's PSW key. For TSO, batch, and Call Attachment connections, the value of the
'Indoubt Resolution' parameter must be 'NO'. The failure is probably the result of a logic error in the attachment
facility.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v All dumps taken by the attachment facility or requesting application.
00F30033

v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v All dumps taken by the attachment facility or requesting application.
00F30034
Explanation: The authorization ID associated with this connection is not authorized to use the specified plan name
or the specified plan name does not exist.
System action: The request to allocate a plan to the authorization ID is denied.
User response: Verify that the correct plan name was specified. If this plan exists, then request execution authority
to the plan from either the owner of the plan or from another person given authority to grant execution authority to
the plan.
00F30035
Explanation: An abend has occurred during an attempt to access the caller-provided authorization ID while
executing in the PSW key of the caller. This is probably the result of a logic error in the requesting program.
System action: The request is not processed.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: This reason code is placed in register 15 during any access to caller-provided information.
When any abend occurs this register indicates which parameter caused the error.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00F30036
Explanation: This reason code may be returned during connection processing for a coordinator thread if a
coordinator for that connection name already exists. This may be a case of two IMS or CICS systems using the same
connection name.
This reason code is not normally visible to users or operators, but may appear in DB2 traces. The ally attempting to
connect to DB2 should have produced diagnostic information relating to the connection failure.
System action: The connection request is rejected.
System programmer response: Collect the diagnostics produced by the allied address space which could not
connect to DB2.
Problem determination: Follow the instructions indicated by the diagnostics to ensure that a different connection
name will be used on future attempts to connect to DB2.
00F30037
Explanation: This reason code may be returned during connection processing for a CICS or IMS dependent
(noncoordinator) thread if a coordinator for that connection name does not already exist. This may be an internal
error in CICS, IMS, or the attachment package.
This reason code is not normally visible to users or operators, but may appear in DB2 traces. The ally attempting to
connect to DB2 should have produced diagnostic information relating to the connection failure.
System action: The connection request is rejected.
System programmer response: Collect the diagnostics produced by the allied address space which could not
connect to DB2.
Problem determination: Follow the instructions indicated by the diagnostics.
00F30038

the caller's PSW key.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: See Problem Determination.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: This reason code is placed in register 15 to identify which parameter was not addressable
in the caller's PSW key. The failure is probably the result of a logic error in the attachment facility.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v All dumps taken by the attachment facility or requesting application.
00F30039
Explanation: This reason code may be returned on a PREPARE request if Network ID (NID) is specified, but NID
was previously specified on the CREATE THREAD request. NID cannot be specified on both requests. This may be
an internal error in CICS, IMS, or the attachment package.
This reason code is not normally visible to users or operators, but may appear in DB2 traces. The ally issuing the
PREPARE to DB2 should have produced diagnostic information relating to the connection failure.
System action: The PREPARE request is rejected.
System programmer response: Collect the diagnostics produced by the allied address space which had the failing
request.
Problem determination: Follow the instructions indicated by the diagnostics.
00F30040
Explanation: The allocation of the plan to the connection failed. Either a resource is unavailable or the requested
resource (plan) is not known to DB2.
System action: Information on the failing resource name, object type, and a Database Services reason code, that help
to explain the allocation failure, are returned to the attachment facility.
System programmer response: Refer to message DSNT500I for identification of unavailable resources and
diagnostics to be collected. Refer to Appendix F, ¡°Resource types,¡± on page 1289 for an explanation of resource type
codes.

connected.
System action: The connection request is rejected.
System programmer response: Obtain all dumps taken by the attachment facility or requesting application.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: The failure is probably the result of a logic error in the attachment facility.
00F30050
Explanation: A DB2 request has been received after a failure during a previous request and cleanup of the previous
request did not complete. This can happen if DB2 recovery was bypassed on a previous request. This bypass occurs if
the application has an enabled unlocked task (EUT) FRR active and requested a retry back to the application
mainline code.
System action: The request is not processed. DB2 will terminate the connection when the TCB terminates.
System programmer response: See Problem Determination.
User response: You must terminate your task. Do not attempt further DB2 requests. Do not request terminating the
connection. You should request a dump for problem analysis.
Problem determination: The diagnostic data should be examined for prior failures while processing a request for
this connection. Users of the call attachment facility cannot retry from an EUT FRR routine if an error occurs during
DB2 processing.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v All dumps taken by the attachment facility or requesting application.
00F30051
Explanation: This reason code is returned when a RECOVER INDOUBT request is received from a CICS or IMS
recovery coordinator, but the thread is still processing in DB2 code other than EOT. The request cannot be processed
at this time but may be successful if issued again later.
This reason code is not normally visible to users or operators, but may appear in DB2 traces.
System action: The current allied request is rejected. The state of the thread is unchanged. The ally issuing the
RECOVER INDOUBT request may have produced diagnostics related to this error.
System programmer response: Collect the diagnostics produced by the allied address space, if any.
Problem determination: Follow the instructions indicated by the diagnostics.
00F30052
Explanation: The caller's connection with DB2 has been terminated, because the caller's recovery coordinator has
already terminated.
System action: The request has been processed by terminating the agent.
User response: Your application program may identify to DB2 when its recovery coordinator has identified again.
Problem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00F30053
Explanation: An error occurred while processing the 'Current Level' parameter. This parameter was provided by the
attachment facility on a termination request.
Either an abend occurred accessing the 'Current Level' or the value of the parameter is invalid.
System action: The request is not processed.
System programmer response: See Problem Determination.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.
Problem determination: For the abend case, this reason code is placed in register 15 to identify which parameter
was not addressable in the caller's PSW key. The value of the 'Current Level' parameter must be zero or a number
representing the connection's authority level. The failure is probably the result of a logic error in the attachment
facility.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v All dumps taken by the attachment facility or requesting application.
00F30054

00F30070
Explanation: Functional recovery for the connection or sign-on processing could not be established. The executing
module could not establish its ESTAE. This can occur if the current address space has insufficient storage. This may
lead to an abnormal termination of the DB2 subsystem.
System action: The connection or sign-on request is not processed. The caller is abended with code X'04E' and this
reason code.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer and restart DB2 if necessary.
System programmer response: Examine the usage and free areas in the LSQA portion of the current address space
private area. If necessary, have the size of the private areas expanded.
User response: A dump should be taken for problem analysis.

Explanation: The requester's authorization ID or password could not be verified. This condition may indicate a
security violation.
System action: The connection request is not processed.
System programmer response: Examine the console/SYSLOG output for RACF messages issued when a request is
denied. Refer the user to your security administrator if the user should be granted access to a DB2 subsystem. If this
error occurred during a remote connection request, examine the communications database to determine the security
controls in effect for a remote connection request.
User response: Verify that you have specified the correct RACF authorization ID and password. If necessary, request
authorization to the DB2 subsystem from your security administrator.
Problem determination: During remote connection processing, Authorization Services invokes the RACROUTE
service using the RACF RACINIT form to verify the authorization ID and password, if supplied, associated with the
requester. If the RACF return code indicates the authorization ID or password could not be verified, the connection
request is terminated with this reason code.

disabled through the installation process.
System action: The plan is not automatically bound.
System programmer response: Rebind the plan prior to execution.
00F30083
Explanation: This reason code is returned because an allied application, or its recovery routine, attempted to issue
an SQL request following an abend that could not be retried (that is, CANCEL, DETACH).
System action: Control is returned to the calling program, either the application program or its recovery routine, so
that end-of-task processing can take place.
System programmer response: This reason code is issued because an allied application had an MVS CANCEL or
DETACH issued against it and its recovery routine either retried back to the application, or did itself, try to execute
another SQL statement to DB2. This call is rejected to help allow the application to be processed through end-of-task
processing.

Explanation: An attempt to was made to invoke the DB2 API for an agent that was currently performing syncpoint
processing. This could occur if an RRSAF attached application invoked DB2 after another control task had already
initiated RRS syncpoint processing for the same DB2 agent.
After syncpoint processing has been initiated on behalf of an agent that is connected by RRSAF to DB2, the DB2 API
may not be used to access DB2 until the syncpoint processing completes.
System action: The API request is rejected.
User response: Serialize the initiation of RRS syncpoint processing with the use of the DB2 API.
00F3009B
Explanation: The RRSAF prepare exit was invoked for a DB2 agent that is currently executing in DB2.
This could occur if a control task initiated RRS syncpoint processing for a DB2 agent while an application task was
accessing DB2 data using the same DB2 agent.
Once a DB2 agent is active in DB2, another task may not initiate RRS syncpoint processing for the same agent.
System action: DB2 returns ATRABACK to the prepare request. The DB2 agent is abended with reason 00E50013.
User response: Serialize the initiation of RRS syncpoint processing with accessing DB2 data.
Problem determination: An entry recording this condition is written in SYS1.LOGREC.

v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00F30212
Explanation: A function that is allowed only for DB2 key callers was invoked by a supervisor state caller in another
key. (Problem state callers receive system X'0C2' abend completion codes instead.)
System action: The caller is abended.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: To determine the DB2 service module running in the wrong PSW key, examine the
SVC dump.
Problem determination: If the invoker is a DB2 service module, an SVC dump and associated SYS1.LOGREC entries
are produced. The invoker should have been in DB2 KEY during the invocation.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).

time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00F30215
Explanation: The invoker of module DSN3AC0X passed an invalid 'QUEUE' parameter. The storage provided could
not be modified in the DB2 PSW key.
System action: The caller is abended with system completion code of X'0C4'.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: To determine the caller of the activate and deactivate service module, examine the
SVC dump.
Problem determination: An SVC dump and associated SYS1.LOGREC entries are produced by a DB2 service
module. The save area chain should indicate the invoker of this service module. The invoker should have set a
correct parameter value before invoking module DSN3AC0X.
Collect the following diagnostic items:

v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00F30216
Explanation: The ASCB for the newly created DB2 subsystem services address space could not be located. The
presumption is that the DB2 subsystem has not been started successfully. Further entry of commands to the DB2
subsystem results in attempts to start DB2.
System action: The current -START command processing is terminated. Subsequent commands are processed as
though this command had not been processed.
Operator response: Retry the command. If the command fails again, notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If the command fails again, request an IPL of MVS, as the failure may be the result
of an MVS internal problem.
Problem determination: An SVC dump and associated SYS1.LOGREC entries are produced. The ASID passed back
by the MVS command scheduler for the -START command is not valid.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).

00F30217
Explanation: The console ID for the MVS console that entered the current command is not found in the MVS unit
control module (UCM) structure. This is a serious error. An internal MVS START command may have been
incorrectly issued by an application program that provided invalid input parameters.
System action: The caller is abended.
Operator response: Retry the -START DB2 command. If the command fails again, notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If the command fails again, request a stand-alone dump and an IPL of MVS, as this
may be due to an MVS internal problem.
Problem determination: The SSOB command extension mapped by IEFSSCM contains the invalid console ID.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00F30218
Explanation: The ERLY block for this DB2 subsystem is in error. The control word that manages command
processing is in an undefined state. This is a serious error.
System action: The current TCB is abended. Two possible reasons are:
v There is no DB2 subsystem services address space. Therefore, the initial command state can safely be set in the
control word, and the current command can be treated as a 'first' (-START) command. Processing of the command
continues.
v The system services address space ASID is known, but the state of the DB2 subsystem is uncertain. In this case, the
command facility is considered disabled, and message DSN3108I is returned to the issuer of the command.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Examine the ERLY block field ERLYCMST. If the value of ERLYCMST is greater than
2, the field is in error.
Problem determination: The calling TCB may have requested an SVC dump or created associated SYS1.LOGREC
entries.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00F30219
Explanation: The ERLY block for this DB2 subsystem is in error. The control word that manages EOM broadcast
processing is in an undefined state. This is a serious error.
System action: The calling TCB is abended.
Operator response: Cancel DB2. (End of task processing may still work, and it does a more complete clean-up than
end-of-memory processing does.) If this does not work, issue the MVS FORCE command for the DB2 address spaces.
If the problem is still unresolved, request a stand-alone dump and re-IPL MVS.
System programmer response: Examine the ERLY block field ERLYEMST. If the value of ERLYEMST is greater than
2, it is in error.
Problem determination: The calling TCB may have requested an SVC dump or created associated SYS1.LOGREC
entries.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00F3021A
Explanation: The ERLY block for this DB2 subsystem is in error. The control word that manages identify processing
is in an undefined state. This is a serious error.
System action: The calling TCB is abended.
Operator response: Stop the DB2 subsystem and reissue the -START DB2 command.
System programmer response: Examine the ERLY block field ERLYIDST. If the value of ERLYIDST is greater than 2,
it is in error.
Problem determination: An SVC dump and associated SYS1.LOGREC entries are produced.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00F3021B
Explanation: A return code other than 0, 4, or 8 was received from the MVS internal START command processor.
The presumption is that the DB2 subsystem has not been started successfully. Further entry of commands to the DB2
subsystem results in further attempts to start DB2.
System action: The current -START command processing is abended. Subsequent commands are processed as
though this command had not been processed.
Operator response: Retry the command. If the command fails again, request a stand-alone dump and re-IPL MVS.
System programmer response: Examine the SVC dump, LOGREC entries, and the console log for indications of an
MVS failure.
Problem determination: An SVC dump and associated SYS1.LOGREC entries are produced.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00F3021C
Explanation: Module DSN3EC0X could not establish an ESTAE during the processing of the first (presumed to be
the -START command) command. The caller is abended. This can occur if the MVS system address space that is
broadcasting the command has insufficient storage. Further entry of commands to the DB2 subsystem may result in a
successful start of DB2.
System action: The caller is abended (without ABDUMP). The current -START command processing is terminated.
Subsequent commands are processed as though this command had not been processed.
Operator response: Retry the command. If the command fails again, request a stand-alone dump and re-IPL MVS.
System programmer response: Examine the stand-alone dump, LOGREC entries, and the console log for indications
of an MVS failure.
Problem determination: A stand-alone dump is necessary.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v MVS stand-alone dump.
00F3021D
Explanation: Module DSN3RS0X could not establish an ESTAE during either the initialization or termination of the
online DB2 subsystem. The caller is abended.
This can occur during initialization if the MVS system address space that is broadcasting the first command
(presumed to be the -START command) has insufficient storage. In this case, further entry of commands to the DB2
subsystem may result in a successful start of DB2.
This can occur during termination if the current address space (usually system services, in case of EOM broadcast, an
MVS system address space) has insufficient storage. In this case, after the DB2 subsystem has shut down, further
entry of commands to the DB2 subsystem may result in a successful start of DB2.
System action: The caller is abended (without ABDUMP). The initialization is aborted, but termination proceeds.
Operator response: Retry the command. If the failure persists, a re-IPL of MVS is necessary and the system
programmer should be notified. A stand-alone dump should be requested first.
System programmer response: Examine the stand-alone dump, LOGREC entries, and the console log for indications
of an MVS failure.
Problem determination: A stand-alone dump is necessary.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
v MVS stand-alone dump.
00F3021E
Explanation: Module DSN3RTR0 could not establish an ESTAE while in the process of routing control to the actual
ESTAE routine. The caller (RTM) is abended. This causes the original error to percolate to a higher-level recovery
routine and causes this abend to be shown in an RTM recovery environment.
This can occur if the current address space (usually an allied address space) has insufficient storage.
System action: The caller is abended (without ABDUMP).
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Examine the usage and free areas in the LSQA portion of the current address space
private area. If necessary, have the size of the private area expanded.
Problem determination: A SYSUDUMP is requested.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v SYSABEND, SYSUDUMP, or SYSMDUMP output.

00F3021F
Explanation: Module DSN3RS0X discovered that the SSVT was not set to its initial state at DB2 subsystem
initialization or termination time. An abend is issued in order to record SYS1.LOGREC data and request an SVC
dump.
System action: The caller is not abended. The SSVT is reset to its initial state. Subsystem initialization or termination
continues.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.

00F30230
Explanation: The module DSN3SSLM discovered that a user exit still exists for an allied address space that is being
disconnected from DB2. This is an internal error.
System action: The connection between the allied address space and the DB2 subsystem is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: A previous part of the disconnection process between DB2 and an allied address space has
either not completed or terminated in error. The SVC dump and associated SYS1.LOGREC entries contain the
relevant material for problem analysis.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v SVC dump (or system dump), taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, as result of an operator-initiated dump command
or SLIP trap exit.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00F30310
Explanation: A nonzero return code was received from the recovery manager. It is issued by module DSN3RIA0
(application resolve-indoubt-UR) and by module DSN3RIM0 (resource manager resolve-indoubt-UR).
System action: This is a DB2 error. The invoker is abended.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Collect the related materials. Determine the called recovery manager module and the
module that issued the abend.
Problem determination: The associated SYS1.LOGREC entry indicates which module issued the abend. Check the
recovery manager resolve-indoubt exit trace for the return code.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00F30311
Explanation: Module DSN3RIM0 could not establish an ESTAE during the processing of a resolve-indoubt (RMRQ)
request. This can occur if the current address space has insufficient storage. This probably leads to an abnormal
termination of the DB2 subsystem.
System action: The caller is abended (without ABDUMP).
Operator response: Notify the system programmer, and restart DB2 if necessary.
System programmer response: Examine the usage and free areas in the local system queue area (LSQA) portion of
the current address space private area. If necessary, have the size of the private area expanded.
Problem determination: The caller should produce a SYS1.LOGREC entry and an SVC dump, so that the system
programmer can examine the LSQA area.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.

00F3040E
Explanation: The DB2 subsystem was abended after a failure during processing of an IDENTIFY, COMMAND, or
MVS HELP subsystem interface broadcast. The recovery routine DSN3SSES attempted to clean up processing and
pass the error to the caller, but was unable to do so.
System action: The DB2 subsystem is terminated.
Operator response: The DB2 subsystem should be restarted.
System programmer response: Scan the SYS1.LOGREC entries for the initial error and subsequent abends
encountered by module DSN3SSES. The ESTAE DSN3SSES is established at least three times. Repetitive errors within
the ESTAE module ultimately result in a subsystem termination with this reason code.

00F3040F
Explanation: The DB2 subsystem was abended because a DB2 latch, critical to the deferred end of task (EOT)
termination process, was held by an MVS dispatchable unit, normally in an allied address space, which was no
longer being dispatched and was, therefore, unable to release the latch.
System action: The DB2 subsystem is terminated with an SVC dump.
Operator response: DB2 may be started again after it terminates. The system programmer should be notified.
System programmer response: At least one SVC dump and associated SYS1.LOGREC entries should be available.
If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about identifying and
reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.

00F30410
Explanation: The DB2 subsystem was abended, because the end-of-task listening module failed during a
must-complete window. End-of-task processing is considered to be in a must-complete state until an ESTAE has been
established. The 'user' of this ESTAE routine was the allied end-of-task listening module DSN3EOT0.
System action: The DB2 subsystem is terminated.
Operator response: DB2 may be started again after it terminates.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.

00F30411
Explanation: The DB2 subsystem was abended because the abnormal termination of an agent failed during
end-of-memory (EOM) processing for an allied address space. The 'user' of this ESTAE routine was the allied EOM
routine DSN3EOM0.
System action: The DB2 subsystem is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer. DB2 may be started again after it terminates.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis

00F30413
Explanation: The DB2 subsystem was abended, because the abnormal termination of an agent failed. However, this
recovery routine was unable to determine who its caller was. It should be one of the following callers: DSN3EOT0,
DSN3EOM0, or DSN3RIM0.
System action: The DB2 subsystem is terminated.
Operator response: DB2 may be started again after it terminates.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.

00F30414
Explanation: The DB2 subsystem was abended, because module DSN3SSI1 (or its caller, DSN3CL0X) was unable to
establish the ESTAEs during the processing of a command SSI call. This is probably an MVS problem, because these
modules are executing in the MVS CONSOLE address space.
System action: The DB2 subsystem is terminated.
Operator response: DB2 may be started again after it terminates. If the failure persists, request a stand-alone dump,
and re-IPL MVS.
System programmer response: This can occur if the MVS system address space that is broadcasting the command
has insufficient storage. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about
identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: DB2 is unable to write a SYS1.LOGREC record or request a dump. The MVS CONSOLE
function should have produced these diagnostic aids. Examine the dump to determine whether the problem is in
MVS or DB2. Other unrelated failures in the MVS CONSOLE address space would indicate an MVS problem.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v SVC dump (or system dump), taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, as result of an operator-initiated dump command
or SLIP trap exit.
00F30415
Explanation: The DB2 subsystem was abended because module DSN3SSI1 (or its caller, DSN3CL0X) was unable to
establish the ESTAEs during the processing of an EOM SSI broadcast. This is probably an MVS problem, because
these modules are executing in the MVS master scheduler address space.
System action: The DB2 subsystem is terminated.
Operator response: DB2 may be started again after it terminates. If the failure persists, request a stand-alone dump
and re-IPL MVS.
System programmer response: This can occur if the MVS master scheduler address space has insufficient free
virtual storage. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information about
identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and Reference.

System action: The DB2 subsystem is terminated.
Operator response: DB2 may be started again after it terminates. If the failure persists, request a stand-alone dump
and re-IPL MVS.
System programmer response: This can occur if the MVS master scheduler address space that is broadcasting the
EOM has insufficient free virtual storage. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: DB2 is unable to write a SYS1.LOGREC record or request a dump. The MVS master
scheduler should have produced these diagnostic aids. Examine the dump to determine whether the problem is in
MVS or DB2. Other unrelated failures in the MVS Master Scheduler address space would indicate an MVS problem.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v SVC dump (or system dump), taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, as result of an operator-initiated dump command
or SLIP trap exit.

Explanation: The application is running in a WLM-established stored procedure address space and is attempting to
connect to DB2 using a type of DB2 Attach other than RRSAF.
System action: The application is abended.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Use the MVS VARY WLM,APPLENV=name,REFRESH command to refresh the load
module in storage.
Programmer response: Modify, relink and rerun the application.
Problem determination: The problem may be that the Stored Procedure is link edited with or has loaded the DB2
call attachment facility language interface module DSNALI. Stored procedures that run in WLM-established address
spaces must be link edited with or must load the RRS attachment facility language interface module DSNRLI.
00F30461
Explanation: DB2 was unable to successfully restart with OS/390 RRS because of an internal error in either DB2 or
OS/390 RRS.
System action: DB2 is not connected to RRS and all services dependent on that connection are unavailable. This
means that applications may not connect to DB2 using RRSAF and that WLM-established address spaces may not be
used for DB2 stored procedures until DB2 successfully restarts with OS/390 RRS.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Stop and then start OS/390 RRS. Stop and then start DB2. If the problem persists,
perform an OS/390 RRS cold start. If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis

00F30599
Explanation: The allied memory function of the subsystem support subcomponent (SSAM) has attempted to remove
an AGNT block (representing a connected allied coordinator task) from the chain of active AGNT blocks before all
the dependent AGNT blocks have been removed. This AGNT block would normally be removed only during SSAM
terminate processing or during EOT processing for the coordinator task. However, in these cases, dependents are
terminated bottom up, and this situation, if it occurs, is a serious one. This message probably represents a logic error
in the subsystem support subcomponent's allied memory function (SSAM).
System action: The requesting SSAM module is abended. The connection name associated with the error is probably
unable to continue communication with DB2 until DB2 is terminated and restarted.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer. If necessary, stop and restart DB2.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: This is usually caused by a previous error that has created SYS1.LOGREC entries and
requested an SVC dump. The SYS1.LOGREC entries and SVC dumps should be examined to determine the actual
cause of the error.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00F30601

v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00F30801
Explanation: The DB2 subsystem was abended by module DSNAPRHX. DSNAPRHX was called and the request
was passed on to the DB2 subsystem. However, upon return, it was discovered that the requesting (calling) TCB was
in a DB2 must-complete function or was still holding DB2 latches.
System action: The DB2 subsystem is terminated. An MVS SVC dump is requested.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer, and restart DB2.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis

time that spans the failure.
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
Problem determination: Attempt to determine if one or more DB2 address spaces is storage-constrained.
Examination of the console output for the time period preceding this condition may reveal other messages or
indications that the terminating address space was storage-constrained.
00F30905
Explanation: End-of-task occurred for the job step task in an allied address space.
DB2 would normally attempt to terminate the address space's connection to DB2, but it was unable to protect its
processing by establishing an ESTAE (extended specify task abnormal exit). Insufficient storage might be the reason
that the ESTAE could not be established.
This abend code can also be issued when an allied address space is canceled or has gone through abnormal
termination and DB2 determines that the address space control element for this allied address space is not deleted or
orphaned. In this case, which is not a DB2 error, code 00F30905 is issued to provide documentation for this condition.
System action: The address space is forced to end-of-memory with this reason code.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis

Problem determination: Attempt to determine if any allied address spaces are storage-constrained, are canceled or
have gone through abnormal termination. If an allied address space is canceled or has gone through abnormal
termination, you can ignore this abend code or suppress the dump from 00F30905.
Examination of the console output for the time period preceding this condition may reveal other messages or
indications that the terminating allied address space was storage-constrained.

00F70003
Explanation: The DB2 subsystem parameters specified that data sharing should be active. DB2 startup checking
failed for either of two reasons:
v The group and member names contained in the subsystem parameters are not equal to the group and member
names contained in the DB2 ssnmMSTR JCL start procedure, or
v The DB2 member is already active on another MVS system.
System action: DB2 terminates.
Operator response: Make sure the correct subsystem parameter load module name was specified for the DB2 that
failed to start. Restart DB2 with the correct subsystem parameter name.
System programmer response: Make sure the subsystem parameter name specified is the correct one for the DB2
subsystem and is not for a different member or group. You cannot share subsystem parameters among the members
of a data sharing group. Make sure the group and member names specified in the subsystem parameters are equal to
the group and member names contained in the DB2 ssnmMSTR JCL start procedure.
Problem determination: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For information
about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis Guide and

00F70407
Explanation: The member name and member ID do not match in the BSDS, the XCF function data set, or the SCA
structure. The following list contains possible reasons of the detected inconsistency (register 0 contains a reason code
and a combination of registers 1 through 5 might contain the mismatched values):
1 The member ID for this member in the BSDS data set is greater than the allowed maximum (248). Register 2
contains the member ID in the BSDS data set.
2 The member name for this member ID in the SCA does not match the member name in the BSDS data set.
Registers 2 and 3 contain the member name in the SCA. Registers 4 and 5 contain the member name in the
BSDS data set.
3 A member name saved in the SCA does not match the name saved in XCF couple data set for the same
member ID. Registers 2 and 3 contain the member name in the SCA. Registers 4 and 5 contain the member
name saved in the XCF couple data set. Register 7 contains the member ID.
4 The member ID saved in the BSDS data set does not match what is saved in the XCF couple data set for the
starting member. Register 2 contains the member ID in the BSDS data set. Register 3 contains the member ID
in the XCF couple data set.
5 The member ID saved in the BSDS data set does not match what is saved in the SCA structure for the
starting member. Register 2 contains the member ID in the BSDS data set. Register 3 contains the member ID
saved in the SCA structure.
6 The starting member name is not found in the SCA entry. Registers 2 and 3 contain the starting member
name.
7 The data sharing group already has 248 members started for it.
System action: The DB2 subsystem terminates.
User response: Review the explanation and compare the information for member names and member IDs in the
BSDS data set, XCF couple data set, and the DB2 SCA coupling facility structure.

System action: The DB2 that was writing an entry in the SCA terminates because the critical function cannot
continue when the SCA entry is not written.
System programmer response: Reclaim space in the SCA by removing exception conditions. f these actions do not
free up enough space, or if this problem continues, you might need to increase the size of storage for the SCA.

Explanation: A command processor has been invoked via the application program support function while the local
lock of the caller's address space was held. CSECT DSN9SCNF tried to obtain the lock in order to obtain a response
message buffer, but it was unable to do so. This represents a logic error in the function that submitted the command
to the application program support function.
System action: Command execution was abended. If the command was properly entered, it may have been partially
or completely executed.
Operator response: Print the contents of the SYS1.LOGREC data set. If a dump was produced, have it printed. It
may be necessary to restart the attachment (IMS or CICS).
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: The diagnostic data table (DDT control block) appears in the SDWA variable recording area
(VRA). For additional diagnostic information, see Chapter 27, ¡°X'F9......' codes.¡±

Explanation: A command processor has been invoked via the application program support function. CSECT
DSN9SCNF obtained the LOCAL lock of the caller's address space prior to obtaining a response message buffer, but
was then unable to release the lock. This condition, if it occurs, is a serious one.
System action: Command execution was abended. If the command was properly entered, it may have been partially
or completely executed.
Operator response: Print the contents of the SYS1.LOGREC data set. If a dump was produced, have it printed. It
may be necessary to restart the attachment (IMS or CICS).
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.

Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00F90002
Explanation: The routines of the multiple console support (MCS) service of MVS were unable to initialize. CSECT
DSN9SCNM attempted to create the console task controller service task, but the task was not successfully created.
This condition may indicate a problem in the address space. If it occurs, this is a serious error.
System action: Subsystem initialization is aborted, causing the DB2 subsystem to terminate.
Operator response: Print the contents of the SYS1.LOGREC data set. If a dump was produced, have it printed.
Restart the DB2 subsystem.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.

00F90003
Explanation: The routines of the multiple console support (MCS) service of MVS were unable to initialize. CSECT
DSN9SCNM or DSN9SCN6 attempted to create a console service task but the task was not successfully created. This
condition, if it occurs, is a serious one.
System action: If the abend was issued by CSECT DSN9SCNM, DB2 subsystem initialization is aborted, causing the
DB2 subsystem to terminate. If the abend was issued by CSECT DSN9SCN6, the command from the associated
console is executed under a different service task and should proceed normally.
Operator response: Print the contents of the SYS1.LOGREC data set. If a dump was produced, have it printed.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis

00F90004
Explanation: The routines of the multiple console support (MCS) service of MVS detected a logic error. CSECT
DSN9SCN7 received a return code from the command preprocessor (the DSN9CMD service) that indicated an
intolerable condition. A return code of X'04' is issued if the DSN9CMD calling parameters are invalid (the command
text length is not a positive number or the PHB address is zero).
A return code of X'24' is provided if storage for a tokenized command statement (TCS) cannot be obtained from the
global storage pool obtained by CSECT DSN9SCNP. The TCS storage request is the first storage request made using
this pool. This is not a user error.
System action: The command was not executed.
Operator response: Print the contents of the SYS1.LOGREC data set. If a dump was produced, have it printed.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.

00F90005
Explanation: A routine of the multiple console support (MCS) service of MVS was not able to create an ESTAE
recovery environment. This condition is detected when the ESTAE service of MVS returns a nonzero return code. The
command from the associated MCS console is not executed. Refer to the appropriate MVS publication for an
explanation of ESTAE return codes.
System action: Command processing is terminated.
Operator response: Print the contents of the SYS1.LOGREC data set. If a dump was produced, have it printed.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: If available, the diagnostic data table (DDT control block) will appear in the SDWA variable
recording area (VRA). For additional diagnostic information, see Chapter 27, ¡°X'F9......' codes,¡± on page 1237.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.

v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00F90006
Explanation: The agent allocation routine was not able to allocate command processing capability to an agent. This
failure occurs, because there is a damaged control block in global storage (CSA). The control block is the command
global data area (CGDA). The address of the CGDA is in the general command processor RMFTRUSE field. This is
not a user error.
System action: Agent allocation is terminated.
Operator response: Print the contents of the SYS1.LOGREC data set. If a dump was produced, have it printed. It
may be necessary to restart the attachment (IMS or CICS) or the DB2 subsystem.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: The diagnostic data table (DDT control block) appears in the SDWA variable recording area
(VRA). For additional diagnostic information, see Chapter 27, ¡°X'F9......' codes,¡± on page 1237.

v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00F90007
Explanation: The command parsing routines have attempted to update one of the command statistical counters that
are kept in local storage. However, the counter control block validation field is wrong, indicating a damaged control
block. The counter control block is located via the 'CGDASTA' address in the command global data area (CGDA)
control block. The CGDA address is in the general command processor RMFTRUSE field. This is not a user error.
System action: The statistical update is not completed. The statistics block address is cleared from the CGDA to
prevent future failures. No further command statistical counts are maintained. Processing for the command is retried
and should complete normally.
Operator response: Print the contents of the SYS1.LOGREC data set. If a dump was produced, have it printed.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: The diagnostic data table (DDT control block) appears in the SDWA variable recording area

v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00F90008
Explanation: The recovery manager control routine has been called, but register 6 did not contain the address of an
execution block (EB) on entry to DSN9SCN9. Because recovery logic requires the address of the EB, CSECT
DSN9SCN9 cannot proceed. The EB hexadecimal control block identifier and the block length are compared to
known values in order to validate the EB address. This is not a user error.
System action: The function requesting the recovery management service is abended.
Operator response: Print the contents of the SYS1.LOGREC data set. If a dump was produced, have it printed. It
may be necessary to restart the attachment (IMS or CICS) or the DB2 subsystem.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.

00F90009
Explanation: This reason code is used to document that CSECT DSN9SCN9 has added information to the SDWA
variable recording area (VRA) following the data provided by the DSNWRCRD service. If DSN9SCN9 records a
failure in SYS1.LOGREC and the reason code in the VRA is not of the form X'00F9xxxx', the reason code is changed
to X'00F90009'. This is done so that anyone examining a SYS1.LOGREC entry can determine, from the reason code,
what additional data has been placed in the VRA. The reason code is the first data item in the VRA, as mapped by
macro IHAVRA.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.

00F9000A
Explanation: The command parsing routines attempted to obtain a descriptor using the DSNZGDE service of the
system parameter manager but the expected descriptor was not found (the DSNZGDE return code was X'04'). All
descriptors used by the parser are contained in CSECT DSN9SCNA. This failure probably indicates incorrect data in
CSECT DSN9SCNA.
System action: Command execution was abended. The command was not executed.
Operator response: Print the contents of the SYS1.LOGREC data set. If a dump was produced, have it printed. It
may be necessary to restart the attachment (IMS or CICS) or the DB2 subsystem.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.

00F9000B
Explanation: The command parsing routines attempted to obtain storage from the storage pool (PHB) provided on a
DSN9SCAN service request. Normally, this is CSA storage in the pool built by CSECT DSN9SCNP. The storage
request could not be satisfied, either because no CSA storage was available or because an unreasonably large amount
of storage was requested. The amount of storage requested is determined by the length of the command being
parsed. Normally, it is several hundred bytes.
System action: Command execution is abended.
Operator response: Print the contents of the SYS1.LOGREC data set. If a dump was produced, have it printed. It
may be necessary to restart the attachment facility (IMS or CICS) or the DB2 subsystem.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: The diagnostic data table (DDT control block) appears in the subsystem diagnostic work
area (SDWA) variable recording area (VRA). Register 8 contains the address of the tokenized command statement
(TCS) control block, and register 9 contains the requested storage length. The TCS is the DB2 internal representation
of the command text. For additional diagnostic information, see Chapter 27, ¡°X'F9......' codes,¡± on page 1237.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).

00F9000C
Explanation: The command preprocessor (GCPC) mainline routine (DSN9SCNP) encountered a validation error
when examining the message chains returned from the command processor.
The command processor invoked attempted to return a message formatted for inclusion in an MVS Multiple Line
WTO.
System action: Command execution is abended.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: This error reflects a failure identified during DB2 internal protocol verification. The
command in error is identified by message DSN9017I. Register 8 points to the start of the response message chain
returned by the command processor. Register 9 points to the message within the message chain that was found to be
in error.
System programmer response: If you suspect an error in DB2, you might need to report the problem. For
information about identifying and reporting the problem, see Collecting data (Collecting data) and DB2 Diagnosis
Guide and Reference.
Problem determination: The GCPC Diagnostic Data Table (DSNDDDT Control Block) is recorded in the Variable
Recording Area of the SDWA associated with the error.
Collect the following diagnostic items:
v Console output from the system on which the job was run, and a listing of the SYSLOG data set for the period of
time that spans the failure.
v Dynamic dump, taken to SYS1.DUMPxx data set, by DB2 (04E and 04F abends).
v Listing of SYS1.LOGREC data set, obtained by executing IFCEREP1.
00F9000D
Explanation: The command preprocessor (GCPC) start-up routine (DSN9SCNE) discovered that the ERLY block is
out-of-date. This error indicates that the current early code is not yet compatible with this version of DB2; a required
early code PTF is missing.
System action: The DB2 subsystem start-up is terminated.
Operator response: Notify the system programmer.
System programmer response: Check the Program Directory, apply the required early code PTF and re-IPL MVS.
