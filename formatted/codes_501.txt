You might also change the JCL to specify DISP=MOD for\r\nthe last data set on the volume or ensure that the application opens the data set with an option equivalent to MOD\r\nsuch as for INOUT processing.

When disk compression is enabled, LANRES will compress each\r\ngroup of 8 disk blocks before writing the data to the VSAM linear dataset. The compression ratio is the ratio between\r\nthe number of bytes actually written to the VSAM dataset and the number of bytes written by the NetWare server.\r\nSystem action: None.\r\nSystem programmer response: None.\r\nUser response: None.\r\nSource: LANRES\r\nEWXxx4211I used K in use,unused K not in use,unallocated K not allocated.\r\nExplanation: Space in the VSAM linear dataset is either in use by a NetWare disk block, allocated but not in use, or\r\nnot allocated. Initially, all space in the dataset is unallocated. As the NetWare server writes to the disk volume, space\r\nwill be allocated to handle the changed disk blocks. As the disk blocks change in size due to different compression\r\nratios, the old disk block space will be placed in a pool of unused space to be re-used by future space allocations.\r\nDisk fragmentation increases as the unallocated space decreases and the unused space increases. You should use the\r\nEWXLDCMP and EWXLDRST commands to rebuild the VSAM linear dataset when the unallocated space becomes\r\nzero.\r\nSystem action: None.\r\nSystem programmer response: None.\r\nUser response: None.\r\nSource: LANRES\r\nEWXxx4212E Linear dataspacedsnamehas not been initialized.\r\nExplanation: The indicated VSAM linear dataspace has not been initialized for use with LANRES.\r\nSystem action: Command processing ends.\r\nSystem programmer response: None.\r\nUser response: Use the EWXLDCRT command to initialize the dataspace and then retry the failing command.\r\nSource: LANRES\r\nEWXxx4213E DIV request for dsnamefailed with error error , reason code reason-code .\r\nExplanation: A data-in-virtual request for the indicated VSAM linear dataspace failed with the indicated error and\r\nreason codes.

When\r\nrunning in a non-TSO environment, TSO commands are not supported and only the PGM and REXX special\r\ncommands may be entered.\r\nThe TSO special command tells EWXEXEC to process the rest of the command line as a TSO command and not to\r\ncheck for special commands. This is necessary if you want to run a TSO command named PGM or REXX.\r\nThe PGM special command tells EWXEXEC to process the rest of the command line as an MVS program invocation.\r\nThe first token following the PGM command specifies the dataset name and member of the MVS load module. The\r\nremainder of the command line will be passed to the MVS program as the parameter string. The dataset name prefix\r\nwill be added unless the dataset name is enclosed in quotation marks. If the load module is located in a STEPLIB,\r\nJOBLIB, or link list dataset, omit the dataset name and specify just the member name enclosed in parentheses. If a\r\ndataset name is specified, it will be used as a tasklib on the ATTACH command.\r\nThe REXX special command tells EWXEXEC to process the rest of the command line as a REXX procedure\r\ninvocation. The first token following the REXX command specifies the dataset name and optional member of the\r\nREXX procedure. The remainder of the command line will be passed to the REXX procedure as the argument string.\r\nThe dataset name prefix will be added unless the dataset name is enclosed in quotation marks. If the REXX\r\nprocedure is located in a SYSEXEC dataset, omit the dataset name and specify just the member name enclosed in\r\nparentheses.\r\nSystem action: EWXEXEC waits for a command.

Continuing to unload could cause the NetWare server processing to stop, print data\r\nto be lost, or both.\r\nSystem action: A continue with the unload command prompt will be displayed.\r\nSystem programmer response: None.\r\nUser response: Discontinue the unload command.\r\nSource: LANRES\r\n1426I Host-to-LAN printing\r\nExplanation: This is a data dictionary lookup.\r\nSystem programmer response: None\r\nUser response: None\r\nSource: LANRES\r\n1427E Error writing data into the print queue (RC=return-code ).\r\nExplanation: An I/O error was detected while trying to write the data into the NetWare print queue. This could be\r\ncaused by a hardware problem on a disk or a NetWare system problem such as no disk space left.\r\nSystem action: The NLM closes the file and removes the queue entry from the system. The NLM resets and waits\r\nfor the next request.\r\nSystem programmer response: If the problem persists, either the NLM should be unloaded or the host service\r\nmachine should be stopped, or both should be done. The cause of the problem should be determined. When the\r\nproblem is found, then the NLM should be reloaded and the host service machine restarted.\r\nUser response: None.\r\nSource: LANRES\r\n1428E Cannot start the function function (RC= return-code ; message).\r\nExplanation: EWXHLPRT.NLM tried to start the function indicated in the message as a separate process in the\r\nNetWare server but the attempt failed. The return code and, if available, an explanation for the error are displayed.\r\nSystem action: Error recovery is initiated.\r\nSystem programmer response: Retry the operation that failed. If the problem persists, look up the return code in\r\nthe NetWare library.\r\nUser response: None.\r\nSource: LANRES\r\n1429E Insufficient memory for internal print job information.\r\nExplanation: EWXHLPRT.NLM creates internal tables to store information about file servers and print jobs. This\r\nerror message is displayed when the NLM cannot obtain enough memory from the server to add to these internal\r\ntables.\r\nSystem action: The print job is canceled and the connection to the host is restarted.\r\nSystem programmer response: The host-to-LAN print program on the host should automatically reconnect to the\r\nNLM and resubmit the print job. If the problem persists, free up server memory by unloading NLMs or add more\r\nmemory to the server.\r\nUser response: None.\r\nSource: LANRES\r\n1430W Insufficient memory to save information for querying host-to-LAN print jobs.\r\nExplanation: The host-to-LAN print NLM cannot save the information necessary for the EWXCONN QUERY PRINT\r\ncommand.\r\nSystem action: Processing continues. The print job will print. The EWXCONN QUERY PRINT command will not\r\nproduce any status on the print job.\r\nSystem programmer response: If other messages are being displayed because of the shortage on memory, follow the\r\ndirection associated with the other messages or increase the memory on the NetWare server.\r\nUser response: None.\r\nSource: LANRES\r\n1431E Insufficient memory for numberread buffer records.\r\nExplanation: EWXHLPRT.NLM cannot obtain enough memory from the server to create an internal table which is\r\nused to receive packets from the host. The number of records for the internal table is taken from the\r\nBUFFERS= numberoption or the default value.\r\nSystem action: The NLM is unloaded.\r\nSystem programmer response: Load the NLM with a smaller number in the BUFFERS=numberoption. If the\r\nproblem persists, free up server memory by unloading NLMs or add more memory to the server.\r\nUser response: None.\r\nSource: LANRES\r\n1432E Insufficient memory for numberthread group records.\r\nExplanation: EWXHLPRT.NLM cannot obtain enough memory from the server to create an internal table which is\r\nused to keep track of the separate processes started by the NLM. The number of processes is taken from the\r\nPROCESSES=numberoption or the default value.\r\nSystem action: The NLM is unloaded.\r\nSystem programmer response: Load the NLM with a smaller number in the PROCESSES= numberoption. If the\r\nproblem persists, free up server memory by unloading NLMs or add more memory to the server.\r\nUser response: None.\r\nSource: LANRES\r\n1433E Incorrect initialization packet received from the host.\r\nExplanation: EWXHLPRT.NLM expected an initialization packet but did not receive one.\r\nSystem action: The connection to the host is restarted.\r\nSystem programmer response: The host-to-LAN print program on the host should automatically reconnect to the\r\nNLM and send another initialization packet.\r\nUser response: None.\r\nSource: LANRES\r\n1434E The host packet that was received is too small.\r\nExplanation: EWXHLPRT.NLM received a packet from the host that did not contain all the required information to\r\nbe a valid packet.\r\nSystem action: The connection to the host is restarted.\r\nSystem programmer response: If the problem persists, contact an IBM service representative.\r\nUser response: None.\r\nSource: LANRES\r\n1435E All the thread groups have not ended.\r\nExplanation: EWXHLPRT.NLM is waiting for all the separate processes to end before unloading or restarting the\r\nconnection to the host, but all the processes have not ended.\r\nSystem action: The NLM is unloaded which will force all processes to end.\r\nSystem programmer response: If the problem persists, contact an IBM service representative.\r\nUser response: None.\r\nSource: LANRES\r\n1436E Unknown host packet type numberreceived.\r\nExplanation: EWXHLPRT.NLM does not recognize the type of the packet received from the host.\r\nSystem action: The connection to the host is restarted.\r\nSystem programmer response: If the problem persists, contact an IBM service representative.\r\nUser response: None.\r\nSource: LANRES\r\n1437W The list of file servers has been locked the lastnumberminutes.\r\nExplanation: EWXHLPRT.NLM is processing a lot of work and is slow in responding to the task that issued this\r\nmessage. The list of file servers is an internal list used by the NLM. This message may appear occasionally on a busy\r\nfile server.\r\nSystem action: The task continues to wait for the list of file servers.\r\nSystem programmer response: If this message appears frequently, contact an IBM service representative.\r\nUser response: None.\r\nSource: LANRES\r\n1438W No receive buffer has been freed the last minutesminutes.\r\nExplanation: EWXHLPRT.NLM is processing a lot of work and is slow in processing the requests from the host.\r\nReceive buffers are used internally by the NLM to read information from the host.

This program was built for execution on NetWare Version\r\nIntended_NetWare_version but is being loaded on NetWare Version Actual_NetWare_version.\r\nExplanation: There are two LANRES programs provided by LANRES for disk serving. One is intended for use on\r\nNetWare Version 3 and is named EWXDISK3.DSK and the other is intended for use on NetWare Version 4 and is\r\nnamed EWXDISK4.DSK. Both programs are shipped on the LANRES diskette and the LANRES installation installs\r\nboth into the SYS:\\EWXNLM subdirectory. The installation program also determines what version of NetWare is\r\nrunning on the NetWare file server from which the LANRES installation program is being invoked and copies the\r\nLANRES disk serving program that is compatible with that version, to the SYS:\\EWXNLM subdirectory as the\r\nprogram named EWXDISK.DSK. Invoking the LANRES installation program from a NetWare 3.xx file server, three\r\nprograms, EWXDISK3.DSK, EWXDISK4.DSK and EWXDISK.DSK are installed to the SYS:\\EWXNLM subdirectory\r\nand the EWXDISK.DSK program is a copy of the EWXDISK3.DSK program and must be loaded only on NetWare\r\nversion 3.xx file servers. Invoking the LANRES installation program from a NetWare 4.xx file server, three programs,\r\nEWXDISK3.DSK, EWXDISK4.DSK and EWXDISK.DSK are installed to the SYS:\\EWXNLM subdirectory and the\r\nEWXDISK.DSK program is a copy of the EWXDISK4.DSK program and must be loaded only on NetWare version\r\n4.xx file servers. This error message indicates that EWXDISK.DSK is being executed on a NetWare file server that is\r\nrunning a different version from that which the LANRES installation program was invoked.\r\nSystem action: The program is unloaded from the NetWare server.\r\nSystem programmer response: Verify that the LANRES Disk Driver program is being loaded on a version of\r\nNetWare that is supported by LANRES. See the LANRES Licensed Program Specifications for details on the versions\r\nsupported. If the NetWare version is supported then determine what version of NetWare is running on the NetWare\r\nfile server that the EWXDISK.DSK program is being loaded on. If it is version 3.xx then copy the EWXDISK3.DSK file\r\nas the EWXDISK.DSK file and reissue the LOAD EWXDISK command. If it is version 4.xx then copy the\r\nEWXDISK4.DSK file as the EWXDISK.DSK file and reissue the LOAD EWXDISK command.\r\nUser response: None.\r\nSource: LANRES\r\n1765E Error on BeginThread call (ERRNO=errno).\r\nExplanation: During the execution of LANRES disk serving, a call was made for the EWXCOMM NLM to begin a\r\nthread, via the NetWare BeginThread API, and the API failed with an errno as indicated.\r\nSystem action: The program continues operation.\r\nSystem programmer response: If the errno displayed is 5 then this indicates that the NetWare file server does not\r\nhave enough memory. Using the NetWare MODULES command, determine which programs can be unloaded to free\r\nup memory. Otherwise, add more memory to the server.\r\nUser response: None.\r\nSource: LANRES\r\n5501E Insufficient memory available for number_of_sessionssessions.\r\nExplanation: EWXCOMM detected an error while trying to reserve memory for the number_of_sessionsthat were to\r\nbe initialized. This number was either specified on the load command for EWXCOMM.NLM, in EWXCOMM.INI, or\r\nthe default of 16.\r\nSystem action: The program unloads.\r\nSystem programmer response: Determine if all of the identified sessions are necessary, and if possible decrease the\r\nnumber of sessions. Using the NetWare MODULES command, determine what other programs have already been\r\nloaded and unload any that are not currently needed. Otherwise, add additional memory to the server.\r\nUser response: None.\r\nSource: LANRES\r\n5503I Initializing TCP/IP.\r\nExplanation: EWXCOMM is performing TCP/IP initialization.\r\nSystem action: EWXCOMM creates a socket and binds it to the LANRES well known port number.\r\nSystem programmer response: None.\r\nUser response: None.\r\nSource: LANRES\r\n5504E Could not initialize TCP/IP (RC= return-code ).\r\nExplanation: The TCP/IP initialization failed with the specified return value. Possible return values are:\r\n1 Cannot create socket\r\n2 Cannot bind socket\r\n3 Error occurred starting ListenTCPThread\r\n4 Unable to locate a port number.\r\nSystem action: EWXCOMM attempts to initialize the other communications options. If any of the other\r\ncommunications options successfully initialize, then EWXCOMM continues to operate. If no other communications\r\noptions are successfully initialized, EWXCOMM exits.\r\nSystem programmer response: Examine the console to determine if any errors occurred in starting TCP/IP.\r\nv If TCP/IP is a necessary connectivity, unload EWXCOMM, determine the problem, and correct it based on the\r\nreturn values, and then reload EWXCOMM.\r\nv If the return value was 1, the server is probably running out of buffer space.

If the request cannot be failed, DFSMSrmm abnormally ends the\r\nrequest. The ABEND code is F13 for an OPEN request and F14 if the request is for CLOSE.\r\nIf the operator enters CONTINUE during OPEN processing, DFSMSrmm issues EDG4007I and the volume is rejected.\r\nDFSMSrmm rejects the volume even after DFSMSrmm is active when you reply CONTINUE during OPEN\r\nprocessing. The MVS mount message is then reissued. For OPEN processing the difference between replying RETRY\r\nand CONTINUE is that the volume is rejected if the reply is CONTINUE. Unless DFSMSrmm is started, OPEN\r\nprocessing is never permitted to complete.\r\nIf the operator enters CONTINUE during CLOSE processing, DFSMSrmm allows the CLOSE to complete.
