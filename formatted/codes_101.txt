The target must be updated to make the target data set look\r\nempty if a utility does the data transfer.\r\n48 The VSAM data set must be copied with utilities, which requires that both the source and the target data\r\nsets be cataloged in the standard order of search.

Refer to previous XRC messages, particularly ANTC8402W, to determine the errors that occurred.\r\nv A dump was requested for a coupled session that forced a delay in coupled processing.

A\r\ndivergence in journal times with little divergence of recovery/advance times can indicate a significantly\r\nslower primary or journal performance than other sessions.

If the error occurs for a\r\nsingle primary or secondary volume, only the affected volume pair will be removed from the session. If the error\r\nimpacts a storage control, all volume pairs using that storage control will be removed from the session.

The\r\ndata set is in use and cannot be scratched and reallocated. This might be caused by the initiator holding\r\nserialization for the data set because the data set is referenced in a subsequent job step.\r\n10 The movable data set on the receiving volume is smaller than the data set on the source volume.

This can happen, for example, if the pre-allocated cluster is cataloged outside\r\nthe standard order of search or is not cataloged at all, while another cluster with the same name is\r\ncataloged in the standard order of search.\r\nv A VSAM data set was pre-allocated on the target volumes, but no catalog entry was found.\r\n30 The volume serials of the pre-allocated, cataloged multivolume data set do not match those of the first\r\nvolume.\r\n31 The VSAM data set was pre-allocated on source volumes, but the catalog entry was not found.\r\n32 Space on the output volumes was insufficient to restore the data set.\r\n33 Allocation errors were unexpected.\r\n34 Data set not processed. Catalog entry for an SMS-managed data set was found but there was no\r\ncorresponding VTOC entry.\r\n35 The VSAM define failed.\r\n36 Processing of an integrated catalog facility user catalog is not supported when input volumes are specified\r\n(using one of the INDDNAME, INDYNAM, LOGINDDNAME, or LOGINDYNAM keywords).\r\n37 The new name specified with RENAME or RENAMEUNCONDITIONAL already exists on the volume and\r\nthe REPLACEUNCONDITIONAL keyword was not specified. The REPLACE keyword cannot be used to\r\nreplace a data set that is being renamed.\r\n38 The VVR for a component of the data set was found, but no corresponding DSCB was found.\r\n39 RENAME or RENAMEUNCONDITIONAL is not supported for unmovable data sets.\r\n40 A nonexistent catalog is specified in the RECATALOG parameter, but the target data set is not\r\nSMS-managed.\r\n41 During physical restore or copy, the target volume is not SMS-managed, but one of the following situations\r\noccurs:\r\nv The ACS routine returned an SMS storage class.\r\nv The user specified BYPASSACS with STORCLAS.\r\nv The user specified BYPASSACS without STORCLAS, but the source data set was SMS-managed.\r\nv The data set is only supported in an SMS environment.\r\n42 The NOPACKING keyword was specified for the data set, but the pre-allocated target was on an unlike\r\ndevice.\r\n43 During physical restore or copy, the target volume is SMS-managed, but one of the following situations\r\noccurs:\r\nv The ACS routine returned NULL storage class.\r\nv The user specified BYPASSACS with NULLSTORCLAS.\r\nv The user specified BYPASSACS without NULLSTORCLAS, but the source data set was not SMS-managed.\r\nv The data set is not supported by SMS.\r\n44 The source component is multivolume, and the pre-allocated target is either a different size or is now single\r\nvolume.\r\n45 The number of tracks on the pre-allocated target does not match the number of source tracks, and it is not\r\nthe first part of a multivolume data set.\r\n46 Allocation of resource failed because DFSMSdss used a utility to perform data movement. Processing ends.\r\n47 Locate failed for a component of the VSAM cluster that was named in the message as the data set that was\r\nnot processed ( dsname).\r\n48 The data set must be copied with a utility, but DFSMSdss is unable to use utilities.\r\n50 DFSMSdss is unable to determine the number of blocks per track for the target device because of an invalid\r\nsource data set block size.\r\n51 The stripe number of the source and target extended format VSAM data sets do not match.\r\n52 The primary VVR of the target data set does not contain extended format information. The pre-allocated\r\ntarget data set cannot be used.\r\n53 The primary VVR of the source data set does not contain extended format information.\r\n56 The requested data set is a PDSE, but SMSX is not currently available or the PDSE cannot be allocated and\r\naccessed at this time.\r\n58 The requested data set is an extended sequential data set, but the target volume selected is not\r\nSMS-managed. An extended sequential data set can reside only on SMS-managed volumes.\r\n59 The source data set for the operation is SMS-managed and has extended attributes. Allocation has selected a\r\ntarget volume that is not SMS-managed. Since the data set is not renamed, the requested operation would\r\ncause the attributes to be lost.\r\n60 The requested data set is a PDSE, HFS or an extended sequential data set, but there is a pre-allocated target\r\ndata set that is a different type or has different attributes.\r\n61 The requested data set is a physical sequential data set or partitioned data set (PDS), but there is a\r\npre-allocated target that is an extended sequential data set or a partitioned data set extended (PDSE).\r\n62 An attempt was made to restore an extended sequential data set either to a non-ESCON attached device or\r\nto a device whose controller does not support extended sequential data sets.\r\n63 The source data set for the operation is SMS-managed and has extended attributes, and the target data set\r\nhas the same name as the source but is not SMS-managed. The requested operation would cause the\r\nextended attributes to be lost. The pre-allocated data set cannot be used.\r\n64 The source data set has extended attributes, but the target data set does not have extended attributes. The\r\npre-allocated data set cannot be used.\r\n65 The target data set has extended attributes, but the source data set does not have extended attributes. The\r\npre-allocated target cannot be used.\r\n67 The pre-allocated target for the restore of a keyrange data set (KRDS) is currently defined with a different\r\nnumber of keyranges than the source dump.\r\n68 During a restore, one or more keyranges of the pre-allocated target of a KRDS have extents on the overflow\r\nvolumes.\r\n69 For a pre-allocated KRDS, the VTOC entry was not found on the volume indicated by the catalog entry for\r\nthe data set.\r\n70 Dynamic allocation failed for DFSMSdss export data set.\r\n71 The SMS indicator in the VTOC entry is off, showing that the data set is not SMS, but the volume is\r\nSMS-managed.\r\n72 DFSMSdss does not provide support to perform a logical copy on hierarchical file system (HFS) data sets.\r\n73 Hierarchical file system (HFS) data sets cannot be restored to non-SMS-managed volumes.\r\n74 An attempt was made to restore a compressed data set to a device whose controller does not support\r\ncompressed data sets.\r\n75 All volumes of a multivolume data set were not included in the input volume list and SELECTMULTI was\r\nnot specified. A list of volumes associated with the data set be printed after this message as additional\r\ninformation to assist the user.\r\n76 All components of a VSAM data set could not be selected. The missing component and a list of volumes\r\nassociated with the missing component be printed after this message as additional information to assist the\r\nuser.\r\n77 The data set would be unusable after a restore because of the relationship between the high allocated RBA\r\nof the VSAM source data set and the target data set.\r\n78 The catalog entry for the data set indicates that the data set is NONVSAM, but the F1 DSCB indicates that\r\nthe data set is VSAM.\r\n80 The pre-allocated data set was unusable because of one of the following conditions:\r\nv The attributes of the pre-allocated target do not match those of the source data set. The target data set is\r\nsingle volume, and the source data set is multivolume, or vice-versa.\r\nv The target data set is not cataloged and has never been opened. Therefore, DFSMSdss cannot determine if\r\nit is single volume or multivolume.\r\nv The pre-allocated target VSAM data set is multivolume and the output volumes specified do not include\r\nall of the volumes on which the components reside.\r\n82 An error occurred during CVAF VTOC access for the data set. Message ADR246E accompany this message\r\nand provide more information.\r\n83 An error was detected while attempting to process the sequence set VVR of a VSAM KSDS with an\r\nimbedded index.\r\n84 The data set is pre-allocated on an SMS-managed volume that is disabled.\r\n85 The current release does not support Large Format Physical Sequential data sets.\r\n86 The source and target volsers are the same. While processing during a physical data set copy renaming of\r\nthe source data set was not performed and data sets with the same name cannot reside on the same volume.\r\n88 Renaming of a VSAM Alternate Index (AIX\r\n\u00ae\r\n) was requested and cannot be performed.\r\nSystem action: The return code is 8. The data set is not processed.\r\nOperator response: None.\r\nSystem programmer response: On a RESTORE, dump the VTOC track records on the input that are at the\r\nbeginning of the file.\r\nProgrammer response: Take the following action, depending on the reason code (reason_code ):\r\n0 pre-allocate the data set with the size and location of the extents to match those on the source volume, or\r\nspecify FORCE. Rerun the job.\r\n1 Specify REPLACE or REPLACEUNCONDITIONAL and rerun the job.\r\n2 Copy/Restore of unmovable/ABSTR data sets is allowed only if the size and location of the extents match\r\nand the data set is pre-allocated. Initialize a new DASD volume with the VTOC extent matching the input\r\nlogical volume, do a TRACKS COPY/RESTORE to copy the VTOC and TRACK 0, and do a data set\r\nCOPY/RESTORE of the failing data set. Use the appropriate utility for the type of data set to move the data\r\nset from the scratch volume to the failing volume.\r\n3 Take appropriate action according to the DADSM return code.\r\n4 Acquire adequate authorization (RACF or password). If it is a checkpoint/restart or system data set, instruct\r\nthe operator to allow the function to continue. You can also change the user authorization exit routine to\r\nallow access to the data set. Rerun the job.\r\n5 Copy or restore the data set in the same environment in which it was created.\r\n6 For a multivolume non-VSAM data set, the volume sequence number must match. For a VSAM data set, the\r\nbeginning RBA of the data set on the volume must match.\r\n7 If it is the same data set, use AMASPZAP to modify the DSORG field in VTOC entry. Rerun the job.\r\n8 Correct the RENAME filter specification. Rerun the job.\r\n9 Rerun the job when the data set is not in use or do not reference the data set in the same job as the\r\nDFSMSdss step.\r\n10 Scratch the data set and rerun the job.\r\n11 See return code 50 under message IDC3009.\r\n12 Use a different backup copy to restore the data set.\r\n13 Contact your system programmer.\r\n14 If it is not a multivolume data set, delete the data set on DASD and resubmit the job. If it is a multivolume\r\ndata set and a RESTORE in which the data set is not restored from the correct input logical volume,\r\nresubmit the job to restore from the proper logical volume. If it is a COPY, pass the proper input or output\r\nvolumes and rerun the job.\r\n15 See reason code number 14.\r\n16 See reason code number 14.\r\n17 See reason code number 14.\r\n18 For physical data set processing: specify REPLACE, RENAME, or RENAMEUNCONDITIONAL if it is a\r\nnon-VSAM data set. Specify REPLACE if it is a VSAM data set.\r\nFor logical data set processing, specify REPLACE, REPLACEUNCONDITIONAL, RENAME (RESTORE\r\nonly), or RENAMEUNCONDITIONAL.\r\n19 Run the DIAGNOSE command of access method services to determine the error.\r\n20 Delete the data set and redefine it.\r\n21 For non-SMS-managed data sets, restore to the correct DASD volume, or use the LVOL parameter to restore\r\nfrom the correct logical volume. For an SMS-managed user catalog, specify the correct DASD volume in the\r\nOUTDD/OUTDY parameter, and ensure that the volume is in a Storage Class with the guaranteed space\r\nattribute.\r\n22 Specify FORCE or free the corresponding location on the target volume, and rerun the job.\r\n23 If it is a multivolume data set, correct the last volume indicator and the volume sequence number fields in the\r\nVTOC, or catalog the data set in the proper sequence in the appropriate catalog. Rerun the job.\r\n24 Specify RENAME or RENAMEUNCONDITIONAL or delete the pre-allocated target data set, and then rerun\r\nthe job. For physical data set COPY, delete or pre-allocate the target data set with the appropriate sized CA.\r\n25 Recall the data set and retry the restore operation.\r\n26 Delete the CVOL from the target volume, then rerun the job.\r\n27 Take one or more of the appropriate actions listed below, then rerun the job:\r\nv Ensure that a DDNAME statement is present in job step.\r\nv Ensure that the DDNAME is not that of a SYSIN or SYSPRINT.\r\nv Ensure that the device specified is a DASD.\r\nv Ensure that the device is supported on the system.\r\nv Ensure that the correct ranges are specified for DASD.\r\n28 See message ADR497E, printed before this message, and take the appropriate action.\r\n29 Take one of the actions listed below; then rerun the job:\r\nv Supply a new choice of output volumes.\r\nv Ensure that the data set is cataloged and the catalog volumes and output volumes on which it is\r\npre-allocated match.\r\nv Restore as a movable data set by specifying the FORCE keyword.\r\nv Supply the name of the catalog in which the pre-allocated cluster resides, by using the RECATALOG\r\nkeyword. If the pre-allocated target cluster is not cataloged in any catalog, then either catalog it or delete\r\nit.\r\nv Ensure that the pre-allocated target data set is cataloged in the standard order of search.\r\n30 Ensure that the correct target volumes for the multivolume data set are specified in the output DD\r\nstatements, then rerun the job.\r\n31 Ensure that the catalog containing this data set is in the standard order of search.\r\n32 Provide a different choice of output volumes, then rerun the job.\r\n33 Provide a different choice of output volumes, then rerun the job.\r\n34 Delete the catalog entry for the failing data set. Full volume dump/restore does not allocate data sets.\r\nHowever, it does restore all of the data tracks as well as the VTOC. Thus, full volume restore can be used to\r\nrestore cataloged SMS-managed data sets with no corresponding VTOC entries.\r\n35 Ensure that the new name specified with RENAME or RENAMEUNCONDITIONAL does not already exist\r\non the volume. If the new name already exists, specify REPLACEUNCONDITIONAL or delete the name\r\nand specify a new name before retrying the command. REPLACE is ignored if RENAME or\r\nRENAMEUNCONDITIONAL is used.\r\n36 Do not specify input volumes, then rerun the job.\r\n37 Ensure that the new data set name specified with RENAME or RENAMEUNCONDITIONAL does not\r\nalready exist on the volume. Specify REPLACEUNCONDITIONAL to replace data set names that match the\r\nrename criteria of the RENAME or RENAMEUNCONDITIONAL keywords. REPLACE is ignored if\r\nRENAME or RENAMEUNCONDITIONAL is used.\r\n38 Delete the VVR for the failing component, and rerun the job.\r\n39 Specify REPLACE or REPLACEUNCONDITIONAL to replace the unmovable data set name under the old\r\nname, and rerun the job.\r\n40 Ensure that the catalog name is correct and available if the target data set is not SMS-managed, and rerun\r\nthe job.\r\n41 Specify either an SMS target or a NULLSTORCLAS.\r\n42 Delete and reallocate the target partitioned data set on a like device, or rerun the job without specifying\r\nNOPACKING for the data set.\r\n43 Specify a non-SMS target.\r\n44 Delete the data set on DASD, and resubmit the job.\r\n45 Delete the data set on DASD, and resubmit the job.\r\n46 Rerun the job when the data set is not in use.\r\n47 Identify components of the VSAM cluster and ensure that they are named and cataloged correctly.\r\n48 See preceding error messages (for example ADR476E) for information as to why DFSMSdss is unable to use\r\nutilities. Take appropriate action as described for those messages.\r\n50 Ensure that the source data set has a valid block size or pre-allocate a target data set with a valid block size.\r\nSpecify the REPLACE or REPLACEUNCONDITIONAL keyword.\r\n51 Delete the pre-allocated target data set and rerun the restore job.\r\n52 See the previously issued ADR432E message. Delete the pre-allocated target data set and allow DFSMSdss to\r\nallocate the target data set.\r\n53 See the previously issued ADR432E message. You might need to use a previous backup copy to restore the\r\ndata set.\r\n56 Ensure that SMSX is available and that the PDSE can be allocated and accessed on the system. Rerun the\r\njob.\r\n58 Ensure that the target volume for the PDSE or extended sequential data set is SMS-managed, or do not\r\nselect the PDSE or extended sequential data set.\r\n59 Either rename the data set and allow the operation to proceed against the non-SMS-managed volume or\r\nmodify ACS filtering in such a way as to cause the target data set to reside on SMS volumes.\r\n60 Process the PDSE, HFS, or extended sequential data set using the RENAME or RENAMEUNCONDITIONAL\r\nkeywords, or rename the pre-allocated target data set, or delete the pre-allocated target data set.\r\n61 Process the physical sequential data set or PDS using the RENAME/RENAMEUNCONDITIONAL\r\nkeywords, or rename the pre-allocated target data set, or delete the pre-allocated target data set.\r\n62 Change the target volume for the restore to a device that is both ESCON-attached and the controller of\r\nwhich supports extended sequential data sets.\r\n63 Data sets with extended attributes cannot reside on non-SMS managed volumes. Either delete the\r\npre-allocated target or restore with RENAME to a new data set.\r\n64 Either delete the pre-allocated target and allow the data set to be allocated by DFSMSdss, or restore with\r\nRENAME to a new data set.\r\n65 Either delete the pre-allocated target and allow the data set to be allocated by DFSMSdss, or restore with\r\nRENAME to a new data set.\r\n67 Take one of the following actions:\r\nv Delete and redefine the data set with the proper number of keyranges.\r\nv Delete the pre-allocated target and let DFSMSdss determine the number of keyranges.\r\n68 Take one of the following actions:\r\nv Delete and redefine the data set. A candidate volume is acceptable in the redefine, but can be retained\r\nonly if the new definition has a primary extent sufficient to contain the primary and secondary extents,\r\nincluding those on the overflow volumes.\r\nv Delete the pre-allocated target. DFSMSdss restores the data set to the volumes from which it was dumped.\r\n69 Take one of the following actions:\r\nv Delete and redefine the data set to ensure that the catalog and VTOC entries match.\r\nv Delete the pre-allocated target and let DFSMSdss restore the data set to the volumes from which it was\r\ndumped.\r\n70 Determine the condition that caused the allocation to fail (for example, authorization failure, and so on),\r\ncorrect the error condition, and rerun the job. To bypass the problem, the user must define a generic profile\r\nwith \"HLQ.*\"\r\n71 Correct the VTOC entry and rerun the job.\r\n72 Use a data set dump and restore or a full volume tracks physical copy to move a hierarchical file system\r\n(HFS) data set.\r\n73 Ensure that the target volume for the HFS data set is SMS-managed, or do not select the HFS data set.\r\n74 Change the target volume for the restore to a device whose controller supports compressed data sets.\r\n75 Specify all of the volumes for the data set or specify SELECTMULTI(ANY) and resubmit the job.\r\n76 Specify all of the volumes for the data set and resubmit the job.\r\n77 Delete the pre-allocated target, rerun the job, and issue an IDCAMS DEFINE RECATALOG to get the\r\nrestarted data set cataloged.\r\n78 Correct the catalog or the F 1 DSCB to correctly indicate the data set is VSAM or NONVSAM.\r\n80 Take the appropriate action listed below, and rerun the job:\r\nv Ensure that the attributes of the source and the pre-allocated target match.\r\nv Either catalog the pre-allocated target, or open/close the pre-allocated target so that DFSMSdss can\r\ndetermine whether it is single volume or multivolume.\r\nv Specify all the output volumes where the pre-allocated target data set resides and run the job again.\r\n82 Contact your system programmer.\r\n83 Contact your system programmer.\r\n84 Use the VARY SMS,VOLUME(xxxxxx),ENABLE command to enable the volume that contains the\r\npre-allocated data set.\r\n85 Process the Large Format Physical Sequential data set using level z/OS V1R7 or higher.\r\n86 For VSAM data sets, specify an output volser that is different from the output volser of the input volume.\r\nFor non-VSAM, specify appropriate RENAMEUNCONDITIONAL criteria or specify an output volser that is\r\ndifferent from the input volume's.\r\n87 The data set is a catalog open for use with RLS access.\r\n88 Correct the RENAMEUNCONDITIONAL filter specification by not including VSAM Alternate Indexes and\r\nrerun the job.\r\nSource: DFSMSdss", "ANTI1021E": " PARAMETER IS NOT IN A CATEGORY\r\nExplanation: A keyword parameter was found that does not belong to a category.

This was done because the block size of the source data set was less than the track capacity of the target\r\ndevice. However, during processing, DFSMSdss encountered a data block ( block_size) from the source data set that\r\nwas larger than the track capacity of the target device. The data block cannot be placed on the target device, so the\r\nDFSMSdss function fails for the data set.\r\nThis situation can occur only when the track capacity of the target device is less than that of the source device.\r\nDFSMSdss allocates to such a device only when target volumes of same, like, or larger track capacity are not\r\nspecified or are specified but do not have space available.\r\nSystem action: The specified data set is not processed. If DFSMSdss allocated the target data set, it is deleted. The\r\nreturn code is 8.\r\nOperator response: None.\r\nProgrammer response: Perform one of the following actions, and rerun the job:\r\nv Provide DFSMSdss with a target DASD device with a track capacity large enough to contain the block size\r\nspecified in the message, by using OUTDD or OUTDYNAM. Specify only target volumes that have a track\r\ncapacity larger than the block size specified in the message. This includes volumes of the same or a like device\r\ntype as the source and any volumes of a device type with a large track capacity. You must also eliminate the\r\nREPLACE or REPLACEUNCONDITIONAL keyword if a pre-allocated target is located on a device with a smaller\r\ntrack capacity than the block size indicated in the message.\r\nv pre-allocate a target data set on a volume with a track capacity large enough to contain the block size specified in\r\nthe message. Specify the volume to DFSMSdss by using OUTDD or OUTDYNAM and use the REPLACE or\r\nREPLACEUNCONDITIONAL keyword to force DFSMSdss to use the pre-allocated target. The target device should\r\nmeet the conditions specified in the preceding solution.\r\nv Specify the REBLOCK keyword. If the source data set can be reblocked and the source data set logical record\r\nlength is less than the target track capacity, DFSMSdss reblocks the data set as it is copied or restored. Certain data\r\nsets cannot be reblocked, so you must use one of the solutions described previously. You can test whether or not\r\nthe data set can be reblocked by specifying REBLOCK and rerunning. If the function fails again, use one of the\r\npreceding solutions.\r\nv If you were performing a COPY, you can update the source VTOC entry to reflect the block size specified in the\r\nmessage by using AMASPZAP if you are authorized to use it.

The functions are described below:\r\nNote: The indicated function can not necessarily be the only source of the delay, but it is likely the cause of most of\r\nthe delay.\r\nPRIMARY(ssid:scid)\r\nThe indicated XRC session detected a delay while reading updates from the primary storage controls. If XRC\r\nwas able to identify the storage control (ssid ) and storage control session number ( scid ) that caused the delay,\r\nit will also report them on this message.\r\nJOURNAL\r\nThe indicated XRC session detected a delay while processing XRC journal records for updates made to\r\nprimary volumes in the session.\r\nSECONDARY( volser)\r\nThe indicated XRC session detected a delay while writing to secondary volumes for updates made to\r\nprimary volumes in the sessions. If XRC is able to identify the XRC secondary volume serial number (volser)\r\nthat is causing the delay, the volume serial number will be reported on this message.\r\nMASTER(msession_id:lsession_id)\r\nThe indicated XRC session detected a delay in processing coupled sessions associated with the indicated\r\nmaster session name ( msession_id ). If XRC was able to identify the logical session that caused the delay, it\r\nreports the logical session name (lsession_id ) on this message.\r\nBUFFERS\r\nThe indicated XRC session detected a delay because of insufficient availability of data mover buffers.\r\nTypically, this condition will be associated with transient delays in other areas (Journal, Master, or\r\nSecondary). Configuration of additional memory buffers can provide relief from such delays.\r\nThe delay for the session is indicated by delay time delay_time, given in hours, minutes, seconds, and hundredths of\r\nseconds (hh:mm:ss.hh).\r\nA delay_time value of '***********' indicates that session delay could not be determined, due to the inability to obtain\r\ninformation about a storage control session. This is typically reported as a delay at PRIMARY, along with an SSID\r\nand storage control session ID. It may be associated with the abnormal termination of a storage control session, or\r\nwith the loss of connectivity to the primary storage subsystem.\r\nMore commonly, the '***********' value will be associated with an I/O timeout that occurred while querying an active\r\nstorage control session. If such I/O timeouts persist, it may indicate a problem with the channels or network that\r\nconnects the data mover to the primary storage subsystem. If, however, you determine that the timeouts are normal\r\nfor your environment, you may consider increasing the timeout value. See the description of the IOTIMING MiscLow\r\nparameter in z/OS DFSMS Advanced Copy Services.\r\nThis message can indicate a temporary peak in application activity on the primary storage control, possibly as a\r\nresult of volume synchronization or resynchronization activity on that storage control. This message can be repeated\r\nperiodically until the condition is relieved, as indicated by the ANTX8118I message.\r\nSystem action: XRC functions are active.\r\nSystem programmer response: This message reports a condition, but does not indicate an error. If the delay\r\ncondition continues for a long period of time, the application can be impacted if primary storage control cache\r\ncapability is exceeded. When this message states that the primary rate exceeds the specified function, ensure that the\r\nDASD fast write option is on for the volumes associated with the function. If volume synchronization or\r\nresynchronization activity is present on any primary storage control, you can want to issue an XSUSPEND command\r\nto suspend the volume pairs that are being added until the application update rate on the primary storage controls\r\nhas returned to normal.\r\nSource: Extended remote copy (XRC).", "ADR316W": " (ttt )- mmmmm (yy), AN {I/O | LOGICAL} ERROR WAS ENCOUNTERED ON THE {VOLUME LABEL TRACK | VTOC | VVDS | DATA TRACKS}, AND ONE OR MORE TRACKS WERE NOT PROCESSED\r\nExplanation: An error occurred on the specified track or tracks on the source volume and CANCELERROR was not\r\nspecified.

The descriptions\r\nare as follows:\r\n\u2013 STORAGE_CONTROL_SESSION_NUMBER_ NOT_ACTIVE \u2013 This indicates a dropped XRC session resulting\r\nfrom an error that ended the storage control session. The error can occur when the update-handling capability\r\nof XRC is exceeded by the update rate to the storage control. In this case, examine the number and\r\nconfiguration of volumes managed by XRC to determine the cause of the high update rate to the storage\r\ncontrol. If this error persists, the XRC environment can require reconfiguration. This error can also occur if the\r\ntimeout interval has expired.\r\n\u2013 STORAGE_CONTROL_SESSION_NUMBER_ NOT_ACTIVE_ON_PATH_xx \u2013 This indicates that the path group\r\nID used by XRC in sending requests to a storage control is physically unavailable. xxindicates the channel path\r\nID associated with the path group ID that is physically unavailable. Ensure that device_numberis online (or at\r\nleast one other device associated with this channel path), and then vary the channel path xxoffline and then\r\nvary the channel path back online. This will make available the path group ID needed by XRC. Issue the MVS\r\nMODIFY command of PATHS to list the channel paths currently associated with the device number\r\ndevice_number.\r\n\u2013 NONVOLATILE_STORAGE_NOT_AVAILABLE \u2013 This indicates that nonvolatile storage has been altered. Issue\r\nthe DEVSERV MVS operator command to determine the status of nonvolatile storage. Do not disable\r\nnonvolatile storage for storage controls that have an active XRC session. Correct the problem by re-enabling\r\nnonvolatile storage and issuing the XADDPAIR command to add the volume or volumes behind the affected\r\nstorage control to the XRC session.\r\n\u2013 CACHE_NOT_AVAILABLE \u2013 This indicates that cache has been disabled. Issue the DEVSERV MVS operator\r\ncommand to determine the status of cache storage. Cache storage should not be disabled for storage controls\r\nthat have an active XRC session.

Refer to previous XRC messages, particularly ANTC8402W, to determine the errors that occurred.\r\nv A dump was requested for a coupled session that forced a delay in coupled processing.

A delta of\r\n00:00:00.000000 indicates that this session is the pacesetter for determining the master journal time. A\r\ndivergence in journal times with little divergence of recovery/advance times can indicate a significantly\r\nslower primary or journal performance than other sessions.

This applies only to\r\ninterlocked sessions, which can be recovered to that common recoverable time. A large recovery/advance\r\ndelta can indicate a significantly slower secondary performance than other sessions. You can reduce the\r\namount of data needed to be applied during recovery processing to bring the coupled sessions to a\r\nconsistent state by addressing bottlenecks on that session or by balancing the workload across sessions.
