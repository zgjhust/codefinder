The CONVMAX value is a 1- to 5-digit number\r\nindicating the maximum APPC active conversations a single address space can have before a critical action console\r\nmessage is issued for operator intervention, if CMACTION is set to be MSGONLY or the CMACTION is omitted\r\nfrom the APPC PROC statement.\r\nThe minimum possible value is CONVMAX=100.

THE ASSOCIATED MVS MEMBER NAME ISmembername.\r\nExplanation: This message is issued when the invocation of an MVS load library resident program is attempted in a\r\nmanner that is not permitted. This error is caused by a call to the z/OS UNIX spawn, exec or attach_exec callable\r\nservice against a z/OS UNIX file or link that does not have the required attributes to allow this type of invocation.\r\nThe following are the possible z/OS UNIX files or links that can cause this error:\r\nv The z/OS UNIX path name supplied to spawn, exec or attach_exec represents an external link that resolves to the\r\nnamed MVS program found in an APF-authorized library and link-edited with the AC=1 attribute. The external\r\nlink must have a owning UID of 0 and not be found in a file system mounted as NOSECURITY to allow this type\r\nof invocation. You can use the z/OS UNIX chown command to change the file owning UID to 0 for a z/OS UNIX\r\nfile or link. See z/OS UNIX System Services Command Reference for documentation regarding the use of the chown\r\ncommand.\r\nv The z/OS UNIX pathname supplied to spawn, exec, or attach_exec represents a regular file with the sticky bit\r\nattribute that resolves to the named MVS program found in an APF-authorized library and link-edited with the\r\nAC=1 attribute. A sticky bit file must have an owning UID of 0 or have the APF extended attribute turned on to\r\nallow this type of invocation. The APF extended attribute is not honored for a file system mounted as\r\nNOSECURITY or NOSETUID. A user must have READ permission to the BPX.FILEATTR.APF RACF Facility Class\r\nProfile to update the APF extended attribute of a file. See z/OS UNIX System Services Planningfor documentation\r\nregarding this profile and setting the APF attribute.\r\nv The z/OS UNIX pathname supplied to spawn, exec or attach_exec represents a symbolic link to a regular file with\r\nthe sticky bit attribute. The named MVS program is derived from the symbolic link file name. If the sticky bit file\r\nhas the set-user-id attribute, the symbolic link must have an owning uid of 0 or an owning uid equal to that of the\r\nsticky bit file. If the sticky bit file has the set-group-id attribute, the symbolic link must have an owning uid of 0 or\r\nan owning gid equal to that of the sticky bit file. If the named MVS program is found in an APF-authorized library\r\nand is link-edited with the AC=1 attribute, the symbolic link must have a owning UID of 0 regardless of the other\r\nattributes of the sticky bit file. In all of these cases, the symbolic link must not be found in a file system mounted\r\nas NOSECURITY to allow this type of invocation. It is possible that either the symbolic link itself or the sticky bit\r\nfile it represents are the cause of the problem. If the symbolic link has the proper attributes, then the sticky bit file\r\nit points to must be checked to ensure it has the proper attributes as described previously.\r\nIn the message text:\r\npathname\r\nThe path name in the z/OS UNIX file system that was supplied to the spawn, exec or attach_exec callable\r\nservice involved in the error. The path name displayed in this message is limited to 64 characters. Note that this\r\npath name might not be a fully qualified path name and may be truncated on the left, or it may represent a\r\nsymbolic link that resolves to the sticky bit file in error. The inode number and device ID should be used to\r\nuniquely identify the fully qualified path name for the file or link that is the cause of the error. Once the fully\r\nqualified path name is determined, its file attributes can be viewed using the z/OS UNIX shell lscommand to\r\ndetermine whether it represents a sticky bit file, a symbolic link or an external link. The following is a ls\r\ncommand example against a file with a fully qualified path name of /u/bin/testpgm that shows the file's\r\nattributes:\r\nls -El /u/bin/testpgm\r\ndevid\r\nThe device ID (st_dev) of file system containing the file or link. Use the D OMVS,F console command or the\r\nz/OS UNIX shell df -v command to determine the path associated with the device ID. A determination should\r\nalso be made as to whether the file system is mounted as NOSETUID or NOSECURITY, since this can be the\r\ncause of the error. The z/OS UNIX shell dfcommand can be used to view the attributes of a file system. The\r\nfollowing is a df command example against a file system with a path name of /u/bin/:\r\ndf -v /u/bin/\r\ninodeno\r\nThe inode number (st_ino) of file. The z/OS UNIX shell find command can be used to determine the fully\r\nqualified path name by supplying to the find command the path name associated with the device ID to start the\r\nsearch from along with the inode number. The following is a find command example where the path name\r\nassociated with the device ID resolved to /u/bin/ and the inode number value is 1250:\r\nfind /u/bin/ -xdev -inum 1250\r\nmembername\r\nThe member name of the associated MVS program that was the target of the failing spawn, exec or attach_exec\r\ncallable service.\r\nSystem action: There will be an associated abend code EC6 reason code xxxxC04A with this error\r\nOperator response: Contact the system programmer.\r\nSystem programmer response: If the identified MVS program is part of an IBM or another vendor's product, contact\r\nIBM or the other vendor that owns this program.

This information can be used for RRS behavior modeling.\r\nRRS currently only reports on transaction state statistics of in storage URs and does not process any URs found in\r\nthe log streams.\r\nFor a given state, RRS invokes exits for that state.

The duration for that UR is the largest elapsed time for all\r\nthe Resource Managers associated with that UR.
