(If you specify\r\nRAQ=YES in the installed profile definition, ensure\r\nthat all input messages are read before the\r\ntransaction is terminated.)\r\n4.\r\nSee the CICS Distributed Transaction Programming\r\nGuide where rules for the correct use of commands\r\nare given. Then correct the application.\r\nThe application program has attempted an operation\r\non a logical unit that is invalid, because the program's\r\ncurrent status on the session with that logical unit does\r\nnot permit it. An investigation of the TCTTE (that is,\r\nSession), status bytes, and TCA type of request bytes\r\nwill reveal which of the above problems are relevant.\r\nWhen the cause of the problem has been ascertained,\r\nthe application program should be changed to ensure\r\nthat the session-oriented information is acted upon\r\nbefore any further requests are sent across that session.\r\nThe session status information is made available to the\r\napplication program in the exec interface block (EIB)\r\nimmediately following the execution of RECEIVE,\r\nCONVERSE, or RETRIEVE requests across the session.\r\nThe relevant bytes must be tested, strictly in the order\r\nshown, and acted upon, before any further operations\r\nare attempted on the session. In addition, the status\r\ninformation bytes themselves are necessarily volatile in\r\nthat they are reset before the execution of every EXEC\r\nCICS... statement. Thus it is good programming\r\npractice to save them into application user storage after\r\na RECEIVE, CONVERSE, or RETRIEVE for later\r\ntesting. The states are:\r\n1. EIBSYNC\r\nthe application must take a syncpoint\r\n2. EIBFREE\r\nthe application must free the session (or\r\nterminate when the session will be freed\r\nautomatically)\r\n3. EIBRECV\r\nthe application must continue receiving data\r\nby issuing further RECEIVE commands; by\r\ndefinition, data cannot be sent while in this\r\nstate.\r\nSome of these status tests can sometimes be omitted\r\n(for example, testing of the EIBSYNC status is not\r\nessential if it is known that the application program on\r\nthe remote system never issues sync point requests\r\nitself). However, the tests should always be carried out,\r\nparticularly if the remote application might be\r\namended at a future date, in which event the session\r\nhandling logic may well be altered. Also, it may be that\r\nthe remote transaction itself causes an unsuspected\r\nflow on the session. For example, if the remote\r\nprogram issues EXEC CICS SEND..... LAST across the\r\nsession, followed by RETURN, a syncpoint request\r\n(RQD2) will be added onto the transmitted data. (The\r\napplication programmer is referred to the CICS\r\nDistributed Transaction Programming Guide for a\r\ndiscussion of this topic). As a result of this addition, an\r\nunsuspected syncpoint request is received by the local\r\napplication, which abend if the session is freed without\r\nthe sync point request being honored.\r\nNote: An ATCV abend is also raised by module\r\nDFHETL if a state error occurs during processing of an APPC mapped application (that is, the program\r\nattempts to perform an operation while in the wrong\r\nstate). The handling of APPC mapped applications is\r\ndescribed in the CICS Diagnosis Reference. Some\r\ncommands are processed by DFHZARQ, as above, and\r\nothers by various other modules invoked by DFHETL.\r\nRules for using commands for APPC are given in the CICS Distributed Transaction Programming Guide.\r\nReference to this guide should reveal the programming\r\nerror.\r\nProblem determination: Register 12 addresses the\r\ncurrent TCA.

Normally these\r\ntransaction(s) or Transactional VSAM unit(s) of\r\nrecovery are the owners of the lock, although this is not\r\nthe case if a chain of requests for the record has built\r\nup.\r\nUser response: Retry the transaction.\r\nIf the problem recurs, see messages DFHFC0164 and\r\nDFHFC0165 or DFHFC0175 to determine the\r\ntransaction or Transactional VSAM unit of recovery that\r\nis holding the lock. In most cases the problem lies with\r\nthe lock owner rather than the transaction that has\r\nfailed.\r\nExamples of reasons why CICS transactions may cause\r\na timeout:\r\nv\r\nThe transaction that holds the lock has a design\r\nerror. For example:\r\n\u2013\r\nA conversational transaction updates a recoverable\r\nrecord and then issues a terminal control read. It\r\ndoes not issue syncpoint (and therefore does not\r\nrelease the lock) until the end user has responded\r\nto the terminal control read. It may therefore hold\r\nthe lock for a considerable period.\r\n\u2013\r\nA transaction updates very many records in\r\nrecoverable files before issuing syncpoint. You are\r\nrecommended to keep the number of updates\r\nmade within a unit of work small and to issue\r\nfrequent syncpoints to ensure that locks are\r\nreleased regularly.\r\nv\r\nThe system in which the lock holder is running is\r\nexperiencing severe performance degradation.\r\nInvestigate the reason for the performance\r\ndegradation.\r\nv\r\nThere is a deadlock between RLS and another\r\nresource manager. For example one transaction may\r\nbe holding an RLS lock and waiting for a lock on a\r\ntransient data queue. The transaction that times out\r\nmay hold the lock on the transient data queue and\r\nbe waiting for the RLS lock. RLS can detect\r\ndeadlocks only when all the locks involved in the\r\ndeadlock are RLS locks. A deadlock such as this can\r\nappear to RLS to be a long wait for a lock and is\r\nreported as a time out. Examine the design of the\r\ntransactions to determine whether resource manager\r\ndeadlocks can occur.\r\nv\r\nIt may be possible for RLS deadlocks to be reported\r\nas RLS timeouts if VSAM does not perform deadlock\r\ndetection until after the time out value for the\r\nrequest occurred. For example, assume that\r\nDEADLOCK_DETECTION is specified as (15,4) in\r\nSYS1.PARMLIB, member IGDSMSxx. This means that VSAM does not attempt to detect cross-MVS\r\ndeadlocks until 4 periods of 15 (that is, 60) seconds\r\nhave elapsed. If DTIMOUT was not active for the\r\ntransaction and the SIT specified FTIMEOUT=30, the\r\nRLS request times out after 30 seconds, before VSAM\r\nhas attempted to detect cross-MVS deadlocks. Adjust\r\nFTIMEOUT, DTIMOUT, and\r\nDEADLOCK_DETECTION to avoid such effects.\r\nDFHFC0175 messages identify Transactional VSAM\r\nunits of recovery owning an RLS lock. If a\r\nTransactional VSAM application is the lock owner it\r\nshould be investigated to determine why it is holding\r\nthe lock. Some of the above considerations will be\r\nsimilar for Transactional VSAM applications.\r\nModule: DFHEIFC, DFHDMPCA"}
