Start path processing was unable to vary the\r\ndevice online. If the device is varied online, XCF automatically attempts to start the signalling path.\r\nSENSE ID CHANNEL PROGRAM FAILED\r\nA request for sense data from the device failed. XCF must have the sense data to operate the CTC adapter\r\ncorrectly.\r\nUNSUPPORTED CTC DEVICE TYPE\r\nThe device is not a CTC adapter type supported by XCF.\r\nPATH UNCONDITIONALLY STOPPED\r\nA stop command with UNCOND=YES was entered for the signalling path. The unconditional stop path request\r\nwas initiated by either the operator or the system. All processing for the start command is ended.\r\nUNEXPECTED ERROR\r\nAn unexpected failure occurred while processing the command.\r\nNO CONNECTIVITY TO COUPLING FACILITY\r\nThe system processing the start command does not have connectivity to the coupling facility containing the\r\nspecified structure. This situation could be due to operator commands such as VARY PATH OFFLINE, CONFIG\r\nCHP OFFLINE or hardware errors such as facility or path failures.\r\nNO CONNECTION AVAILABLE FOR XCF\r\nXCF was unable to connect to the structure. There was no connection available for XCF to use. Possible\r\nexplanations include:\r\nv The maximum number of connectors to a structure has been reached for the CFRM active policy.\r\nv The model dependent limit on the maximum number of connectors to a list structure has been reached for the\r\ncoupling facility that contains the list structure.\r\nv Some non-XCF connector is connected to the structure. A non-XCF connector can prevent XCF from\r\nconnecting to a structure even though not all the connections are in use.\r\nIXLCONN SERVICE COULD NOT CONNECT\r\nAn unexpected return and reason code was returned by the IXLCONN service when XCF attempted to connect\r\nto the structure.\r\nDELAYED UNTIL STOP COMPLETES\r\nA system initiated start command is delayed until stop path processing completes. The system will automatically\r\nstart the path upon successful completion of the stop, provided the path remains defined to XCF for signalling.\r\nUNABLE TO ALLOCATE A LIST FOR A SIGNALLING PATH\r\nAn unexpected error occurred while attempting to allocate a specific list within the structure for the list\r\nsignalling path to use.\r\nREMOTE SYSTEM NO LONGER USING STRUCTURE\r\nThe system to which the list path was to establish signalling connectivity is no longer using the structure for\r\nsignalling.\r\nSTRUCTURE FAILURE\r\nThe structure failed.\r\nSYSTEMS NO LONGER USING STRUCTURE IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS\r\nThe system with which the list path was to establish signalling connectivity is no longer using the structure for\r\nsignalling in the opposite direction. List paths are established between those pairs of systems for which the\r\nstructure has been defined for outbound use on one system and inbound use on the other system.\r\nTOO FEW LISTS IN STRUCTURE\r\nA list could not be allocated for the list path. Either the list structure was not allocated with enough lists for all\r\nthe desired list paths or there is a list path in the midst of stop processing that has not yet deallocated its list.\r\nLIST NOTIFICATION VECTOR TOO SMALL\r\nThe list notification vector for the list structure is not large enough for all the lists that need to be monitored for\r\nlist transitions. There was not enough storage available in the Hardware System Area (HSA) for a larger vector.\r\nREMOTE SYSTEM STOPPED USING LIST\r\nThe system to which the list path was to establish signalling connectivity is stopping its side of the list path.\r\nDELAYED UNTIL STRUCTURE UNQUIESCED\r\nThe system processing the start command has quiesced all I/O operations to the structure. The start of the list\r\npath is delayed until I/O to the structure is again permitted.\r\nUNEXPECTED HARDWARE ERROR\r\nThe signalling path could not be started due to an unexpected hardware error.\r\nSTRUCTURE NOT DEFINED IN ACTIVE POLICY\r\nThe indicated structure name is not defined in the CFRM active policy. The structure must be defined in the\r\nactive policy in order to connect to the structure.\r\nNEW CONNECTIONS TO STRUCTURE BEING PREVENTED\r\nNew connections to the requested structure are being prevented at this time for one of the following reasons:\r\nv All active connectors have confirmed the rebuild quiesce event. New connections will not be permitted until\r\nthe rebuild or rebuild stop is completed\r\nv The structure is allocated in a coupling facility that is failed. New connections will not be permitted until the\r\nstructure is rebuilt, or all connections disconnect causing the structure to be deallocated.\r\nv The coupling facility containing the structure is not available for use because policy reconciliation is in\r\nprogress. New connections will not be permitted until policy reconciliation is complete.\r\nv New structure allocations for this structure name are not permitted because there is a pending policy change\r\nfor this structure. New connections will not be permitted until the change is complete.\r\nUNABLE TO DEFINE LOCAL LIST NOTIFICATION VECTOR\r\nThe list notification vector used to monitor list transitions could not be defined. The situation is most likely\r\ncaused by a lack of storage in the Hardware System Area (HSA).\r\nOTHER SYSTEMS USING STRUCTURE INCOMPATIBLY\r\nSome other system is using the structure in ways that are not compatible with the protocols used by the system\r\nthat processed the start command. The signalling path is stopped to avoid interfering with those systems.\r\nCOUPLE DATA SET FOR CFRM NOT AVAILABLE\r\nThe couple data set for CFRM is not available to this system. In order to connect to structures, the couple data\r\nset for CFRM must be available.\r\nFor a system that is IPLing into an existing sysplex, this failure also arises when the indicated structure is not\r\ndefined in the CFRM active policy.\r\nDELAYED UNTIL STRUCTURE DUMP COMPLETES\r\nThe connect to the structure could not complete because SVC Dump holds serialization on the structure.\r\nSTRUCTURE'S DISPOSITION IS KEEP\r\nThe structure already exists but was created with a disposition that allows it to persist (remain allocated) when\r\nthere are no defined connections. Since the system that processed the start command does not use persistent\r\nstructures, the structure is being used in ways that are not compatible with its protocols. The signalling path is\r\nstopped to avoid interfering with the other systems using the structure.\r\nSTRUCTURE'S LIST ENTRY SIZE TOO SMALL\r\nThe structure already exists but was created with a maximum size list entry that is not large enough to contain\r\n65536 bytes of data. Since the system that processed the start command creates list entries containing up to 65536\r\nbytes of data, the structure is being used in ways that are not compatible with its protocols. The signalling path\r\nis stopped to avoid interfering with the other systems using the structure.\r\nSTRUCTURE DOES NOT USE ADJUNCT DATA\r\nThe structure already exists but does not use adjunct data. Since the system that processed the start command\r\nuses adjunct data for its list entries, the structure is being used in ways that are not compatible with its\r\nprotocols. The signalling path is stopped to avoid interfering with the other systems using the structure.\r\nSTRUCTURE DOES NOT USE DATA ELEMENTS\r\nThe structure already exists but does not use data elements. Since the system that processed the start command\r\nuses list entries containing data elements, the structure is being used in ways that are not compatible with its\r\nprotocols. The signalling path is stopped to avoid interfering with the other systems using the structure.\r\nSTRUCTURE DOES NOT COUNT LIST ENTRIES\r\nThe structure already exists but does maintain list counts on a list entry basis. Since the system that processed\r\nthe start command uses list entry counts, the structure is being used in ways that are not compatible with its\r\nprotocols. The signalling path is stopped to avoid interfering with the other systems using the structure.\r\nIPLING SYSTEM UNABLE TO WRITE STRUCTURE\r\nXCF connected to the structure before the IPLing system became active in the sysplex. It is not possible to make\r\nany updates to the structure until after the system becomes active in the sysplex. However, once the IPLing\r\nsystem became active in the sysplex, it still could not make updates.\r\nXES FUNCTION NOT AVAILABLE\r\nXES functions are not available. This situation can arise when the hardware necessary to provide XES functions\r\nis not present.\r\nSTRUCTURE IN USE BY A NON-XCF CONNECTOR\r\nThe structure already exists, but one or more of the connectors is not XCF. Since it appears that the structure is\r\nin use by some other application, XCF disconnects from the structure to avoid interfering with that application.\r\nStructures to be used by XCF for signalling should be dedicated exclusively to XCF in order to ensure correct\r\noperation of the signalling service. Message IXC452I is issued to identify the non-XCF connectors.\r\nDELAYED UNTIL REBUILD COMPLETES\r\nThe structure already exists, but there is a rebuild in progress. The system processing the start command elected\r\nnot to participate in the rebuild.\r\nDELAYED UNTIL AN ACTIVE SYSTEM ALLOCATES STRUCTURE\r\nAn system cannot allocate a structure for signalling until after the system is active in the sysplex and XES\r\nservices are available. Systems attempting to IPL into a sysplex may be able to connect to an existing structure in\r\nuse by XCF for signalling, but cannot create such a structure. The indicated structure does not yet exist.\r\nUSER SYNC POINT SET\r\nThe structure already exists, but there is a user sync point set. Sync points are set during rebuild processing, but\r\nare otherwise unexpected. If there is a rebuild in progress,'the start is delayed until the rebuild completes. If\r\nthere is no rebuild in progress, an unexpected error has occurred. The error could be caused by a non-XCF\r\nconnector using the structure.\r\nSTRUCTURE IN USE BY ANOTHER SYSPLEX\r\nThe structure already exists, but appears to be in use by systems in a different sysplex. Signalling paths are only\r\npermitted between systems participating in the same sysplex.\r\nNOT ENOUGH FREE SPACE IN STRUCTURE FOR SIGNALLING\r\nThere is not enough space available in the structure for XCF to use it for signalling. After connecting to the\r\nstructure, XCF verifies that there is enough space available to manage the structure and to be able to send at\r\nleast one signal of the maximum supported message length. If the size of the structure is greater than or equal to\r\nthe maximum structure size defined in the CFRM active policy, the size specified in the policy must be increased\r\nso that a larger structure can be allocated. If the allocated structure size is less than the size defined in the policy\r\nfor the structure, the coupling facility containing the structure did not have enough space available to allocate\r\nthe structure as large as the policy allowed. Either more space needs to be made available in the coupling facility,\r\nor the structure needs to be allocated in a coupling facility that can accommodate it.\r\nUNABLE TO ALLOCATE STRUCTURE\r\nStructure could not be allocated. Message IXC463I is written to the system log to explain why the allocation\r\nfailed in each of the coupling facilities that was tried. The preference list and exclusion list in the CFRM active\r\npolicy determines which coupling facilities are allowed to contain the structure.\r\n DIAG073=nnnnn\r\nDiagnostic data that is provided to assist IBM service personnel with problem determination.\r\nRC=n, RSN=n\r\nDiagnostic data that is provided to assist IBM service personnel with problem determination.\r\nSystem action: The signalling path remains defined to XCF as a signalling path (provided the system has not\r\nprocessed a SETXCF STOP path operator command). The signalling path is considered to be in an INOPERATIVE\r\nstate' If the problems that prevent the path from starting are resolved, a new start command can be entered. In many\r\ncases, the system is able to detect circumstances for which the problems may have been resolved and automatically\r\ninitiates a new start request. In the case of a list structure, the system may attempt to rebuild the structure.\r\nOperator response: If the path was specified incorrectly, enter a SETXCF STOP path command so that the path is no\r\nlonger defined to XCF for signalling. The stop prevents the system from using resources to manage the path\r\ndefinition and prevents attempts to start a path that is not intended to be used for signalling. Then enter a SETXCF\r\nSTART path command with the path specified correctly.\r\nFor a path that was correctly specified, any hardware, definitional, or capacity problems must be resolved before the\r\npath can be used for signalling. In some cases these problems are resolved automatically by the system. For other\r\ncases, manual intervention is required. The type of manual intervention needed varies according to the message text.\r\nAfter the problem is resolved, it is often the case that no further action is necessary as the system automatically starts\r\nthe path again. If needed or desired, enter a SETXCF START path command to manually reinitiate start processing\r\nfor the path' If the problem persists, do the following:\r\n1. Record the name of the signalling path, the text explaining why the start was not successful, and any diagnostic\r\ndata presented with this message. The system programmer will need this information if it becomes necessary to\r\ncontact IBM service for problem resolution.\r\n2. Enter the display commands appropriate to the particular type of signalling path' Record the results of the\r\ndisplay commands to assist with problem determination.\r\n3. Contact hardware support as needed.\r\n4. Contact the system programmer as needed.\r\nThe following commands are useful for investigating unsuccessful start path requests for devices:\r\nv DISPLAY U,CTC,ALLOC,dev to display the allocation information for a CTC device with device number dev.\r\nv DISPLAY U,CTC,,dev to display the status of the device.\r\nv Enter a DISPLAY M=DEV(dev) to display the state of the channel paths to the device with device number dev.\r\nThe following commands are useful for investigating unsuccessful start path requests for structures and list paths. In\r\nsome cases, it may be helpful to enter these commands on systems in the sysplex other than the one that was\r\nprocessing the start path request.\r\nv DISPLAY XCF,PATHOUT,STRNAME=strname to display detailed information about the use of the structure for\r\nsignalling, including the state of the outbound list paths that have been started.\r\nv DISPLAY XCF,PATHIN,STRNAME=strname to display detailed information about the use of the structure for\r\nsignalling, including the state of the inbound list paths that have been started.\r\nv DISPLAY XCF,STRUCTURE to display summary information about the structures defined in this sysplex.\r\nv DISPLAY XCF,STRUCTURE,STRNAME=strname to display detailed information about the indicated structure.\r\nv DISPLAY XCF,CF to display summary information about the coupling facilities defined in this sysplex.\r\nv DISPLAY XCF,CF,CFNAME=cfname to display detailed information about the indicated coupling facility as defined\r\nto the sysplex.\r\nv DISPLAY CF to display summary hardware information about the coupling facilities connected to a system.\r\nv DISPLAY CF,CFNAME= cfname to display detailed hardware information about the indicated coupling facility\r\nconnected to a system.\r\nv DISPLAY M=CHP(chp) to display the state of the channel paths connecting a system to a coupling facility.\r\nDepending on the message text, do the following manual intervention:\r\nUNABLE TO ALLOCATE DEVICE\r\nDisplay the allocation information for the device by entering the DISPLAY U,CTC,ALLOC,dev command. If\r\nappropriate, deallocate the device from the indicated user.\r\nIf the device is used by global resource serialization and is to be made available to XCF, deallocate it by entering\r\nthe VARY dev,OFFLINE,FORCE command. Enter the command from both systems attached to that device.\r\nNO CHANNEL PATHS PHYSICALLY DEFINED TO DEVICE\r\nEnter the VARY command to make sure there are channel paths online for this device.\r\nDEVICE IS NOT ONLINE\r\nEnter the VARY command to vary the device online.\r\nNO CONNECTIVITY TO COUPLING FACILITY\r\nEnter a DISPLAY XCF,STRUCTURE,STRNAME= strname for information about which coupling facility contains\r\nthe indicated structure. Enter a DISPLAY CF,CFNAME=cfname command to display the status of that coupling\r\nfacility and the channel paths that connect the system to it, ( cfname is the name of the coupling facility that\r\ncontains the structure).\r\nEnter a CONFIG CHP command to configure channel paths to the coupling facility, if needed. Enter a VARY\r\nPATH command to vary the channel paths online to the system, if needed.\r\nNO CONNECTION AVAILABLE FOR XCF\r\nEnter a DISPLAY XCF,STRUCTURE,STRNAME= strname command for information about the connectors to the\r\nstructure. Enter a DISPLAY XCF,POLICY,TYPE=CFRM command for information about the CFRM active policy.\r\nConsult the system programmer as needed to determine whether to:\r\nv Perform the steps needed to activate a CFRM policy that has been formatted to support more connectors.\r\nv Enter a SETXCF START,REBUILD command to rebuild the structure in a coupling facility that supports more\r\nconnectors.\r\nv Perform the steps needed to cause the non-XCF connector to disconnect from the structure.\r\nLIST NOTIFICATION VECTOR TOO SMALL\r\nUNABLE TO DEFINE LOCAL LIST NOTIFICATION\r\nVECTOR\r\nEnter a DISPLAY XCF,STR command to determine which structures are in use' For each structure that is in use,\r\nenter a DISPLAY,XCF,STR,STRNAME=inusestr , where inusestr is the name of an in use structure, to determine\r\nwhich applications are connected to the structure from this system. Consult the system programmer as needed to\r\ndetermine whether to reduce the number of connectors connected to structures from the system that processed\r\nthe start command, or to modify the way in which the connectors are using the structure, or to perform the steps\r\nneeded to increase the amount of storage in the Hardware System Area (HSA).\r\nSTRUCTURE NOT DEFINED IN ACTIVE POLICY\r\nConsult the system programmer as needed to determine which CFRM policy should be made active. Enter a\r\nSETXCF START,POLICY,TYPE=CFRM,POLNAME=polname to activate the policy named polname which defines\r\nthe structure.\r\nCOUPLE DATA SET FOR CFRM NOT AVAILABLE\r\nEnter a DISPLAY XCF,COUPLE,TYPE=CFRM command to list the couple data set in use for CFRM. Consult the\r\nsystem programmer as needed to determine which coupling data set should be made available for CFRM. As\r\nneeded, enter a SETXCF COUPLE command for a couple data set to be used for CFRM.\r\nDELAYED UNTIL STRUCTURE DUMP COMPLETES\r\nThe system automatically starts the path again when the dump completes. However, if the dump does not\r\ncomplete within a reasonable time, enter a DISPLAY,XCF,STRNAME= strname command for information about\r\nthe structure dump. To force the dump serialization to be released, enter a SETXCF FORCE,STRDUMPSERIAL\r\ncommand. Note however, that the requested structure dump may then fail to contain the data needed for\r\nproblem determination.\r\nDELAYED UNTIL REBUILD COMPLETES\r\nThe system automatically starts the path again when rebuild completes. However, if the rebuild does not\r\ncomplete within a reasonable time, enter a DISPLAY,XCF,STRNAME= strname command for information about\r\nthe state of the structure and rebuild processing. One possible source of rebuild delay is a connector failing to\r\nrespond to a rebuild event. Ensure that all connectors are operational and that there is signalling connectivity\r\nbetween all the systems in the sysplex so that responses can be processed. It may be necessary to force a\r\nconnector to disconnect, which causes an implicit response to be made. Use the SETXCF STOP path command\r\nfor each applicable direction to force XCF to disconnect from the structure on the system that processes the stop\r\npath command.\r\nDELAYED UNTIL AN ACTIVE SYSTEM ALLOCATES STRUCTURE\r\nUsually, no action is needed since the system automatically starts the path again once the system becomes active\r\nin the sysplex and XES services become available. So if an IPLing system is able to establish signalling\r\nconnectivity with the other systems in the sysplex, no action is needed.\r\nIf an IPLing system is not able to establish signalling connectivity with the other systems in the sysplex, action\r\nmay be needed on one or more of the systems already active in the sysplex before the IPL can proceed. Message IXC454I lists the systems for which signalling connectivity cannot be established. Consult the system\r\nprogrammer as needed to determine which of the these systems are to use the indicated structure to establish\r\nsignalling connectivity with the IPLing system. The structure must be started as an XCF signalling path on those\r\nsystems. If the active systems are themselves IPLing, the indicated structure will be started as a consequence of\r\nbeing defined as a signalling path in the COUPLExx parmlib member. If not, enter a SETXCF START path\r\ncommand on the active systems as needed to start the structure for signalling in the appropriate directions.\r\nMessage IXC306I is issued when the structure is successfully started for signalling. After the active systems\r\nsuccessfully start the structure for signalling, respond to message IXC455D on the IPLing system that needs to\r\nestablish signalling connectivity.\r\nSystem programmer response: Do the following:\r\n1. Examine the information provided by the operator.\r\n2. Ensure that the signalling path is correctly defined to XCF.\r\n3. Ensure that the hardware is correctly configured, defined to the system, and operational.\r\n4. Perform the actions suggested below for the indicated message text.\r\n5. Examine logrec error records for I/O errors or other hardware problems related to the signalling path.\r\n6. Examine the system log for other messages related to the signalling path. In the case of a list structure, messages IXC452I, IXC457I, and IXC463I are especially relevant.\r\n7. Obtain the following additional diagnostic information as appropriate for problem determination:\r\nv The XCF component trace table. The trace table must be obtained within 30 seconds of completion of the\r\ncommand if XCF detail tracing is enabled, and within a few minutes if just XCF default tracing is in effect.\r\nDefault tracing is sufficient to resolve this problem.\r\nv For list structures, the XES component trace tables. Obtain both the global trace buffer and the connection\r\nrelated trace buffer.\r\nv A GTF I/O trace of the device.\r\nIf the problem persists, search problem reporting data bases for a fix for the problem. If no fix exists, contact the IBM\r\nSupport Center. Supply any diagnostic data presented as part of the start failed message, any output from the\r\nDISPLAY commands issued while investigating the problem, the system log(s), and any of the traces that were\r\nobtained.\r\nDepending on the message text, the following actions are appropriate:\r\nALL CONNECTIONS TO STRUCTURE ARE IN USE\r\nIf the maximum number of connectors to a structure has been reached for the CFRM active policy, use the XCF\r\ncouple data set format utility to create a new couple data set that supports more connectors. Run the XCF\r\nAdministrative Data Utility to recreate the CFRM policy in the new couple data set. Have the operator make this\r\ncouple data set available to the sysplex.\r\nIf the model dependent limit on the maximum number of connectors to a list structure has been reached for the\r\ncoupling facility that contains the list structure, have the operator rebuild the structure into some other coupling\r\nfacility that can support the required number of connectors. If so, consider modifying the preference list in the\r\nCFRM policy so that the structure is allocated in coupling facilities that can support the required number of\r\nconnectors. If no suitable coupling facility is available, consider defining more list structures for signalling so that\r\neach list structures provides signalling connectivity for a subset of systems in the sysplex. The structures together\r\ncan provide for full signalling connectivity but the number of connectors need not exceed the model dependent\r\nlimits on the number of connectors.\r\nIf some non-XCF connector is connected to the structure, take whatever steps are needed to force that connector\r\nto disconnect.\r\nLIST NOTIFICATION VECTOR TOO SMALL\r\nUNABLE TO DEFINE LOCAL LIST NOTIFICATION VECTOR\r\nThere was not enough storage available in the Hardware System Area (HSA) of the system that processed the\r\nstart command to allow a list notification vector of the required length to be defined. Either reduce the amount\r\nof storage being used in the HSA, or increase the amount of storage available in the HSA for creating list\r\nnotification vectors. Reduce the amount of HSA storage being used by decreasing the number of connectors or\r\nchanging the way connectors make use of their structure. For example, the size of the list notification vector\r\nrequired by the XCF signalling service is determined by the number of inbound list paths to be started. As\r\nanother example, changing the number of buffers associated with a XES cache structure changes the amount of\r\nHSA storage required by the connector.\r\nSTRUCTURE NOT DEFINED IN ACTIVE POLICY\r\nA CFRM policy containing a definition for the structure must be made active' As needed, run the XCF\r\nAdministrative Data Utility to define the structure in a policy. Have the operator enter a SETXCF START,POLICY\r\ncommand to activate a policy that defines the structure.\r\nCOUPLE DATA SET FOR CFRM NOT AVAILABLE\r\nUse the XCF format utility program to format a couple data set for CFRM. Ensure that the couple data set\r\nformatted for CFRM is available to the system.\r\nNOT ENOUGH FREE SPACE IN STRUCTURE FOR SIGNALLING\r\nIf the size of the structure is greater than or equal to the maximum structure size defined in the CFRM active\r\npolicy, use the XCF Administrative Data Utility to increase the structure size specified in a policy. Have the\r\noperator activate the updated policy.\r\nIf the allocated structure size is less than the size defined in the policy for the structure, the coupling facility\r\ncontaining the structure did not have enough space available to allocate the structure as large as the policy\r\nallowed. Either more space needs to be made available in the coupling facility, or the structure needs to be\r\nallocated in a coupling facility that can accommodate it. More space can be made available in a coupling facility\r\nby causing structures to be deallocated from that facility, or by decreasing the amount of space reserved for\r\nstructure dumps. It may be necessary to modify the preference list or the exclusion list defined in the CFRM\r\npolicy to allow the structure to be allocated in a more suitable coupling facility. Alternatively, it may be necessary\r\nto make a new coupling facility available for the sysplex to use.\r\nUNABLE TO ALLOCATE STRUCTURE\r\nExamine the system log for instances of message IXC463I for explanations of why the structure could not be\r\nallocated. Message IXC463I is issued for each coupling facility that was considered. Resolve the problems\r\nindicated by message IXC463I or make a suitable coupling facility available for use.\r\nSource: Cross System Coupling Facility (SCXCF)\r\nModule: IXCT1FSR, IXCT1FSS, IXCT1ISS, IXCT1PCC\r\nRouting code: 1,2\r\nDescriptor code: 5,12.", "IXZ0300E": " FAILED TO JOIN XCF GROUP RC= retcode RSN= reason-code\r\nExplanation: An internal JESXCF function attempted to attach to the JESXCF component using the JESXCF attach\r\nservice (IXZXIXAT).

Restart\r\nprocessing is initiated to re-establish the path and thereby restore it to service. This system may have\r\ndetected an error, or it simply may be reacting to an action taken by the system to which the path is\r\nconnected.\r\nREBUILDING\r\nA XES list structure used by the XCF signalling service is to be rebuilt. Rebuild processing is initiated to\r\nrecover from errors or to reconfigure resources related to coupling facilities. This system may be initiating\r\npath rebuild processing, or may be doing so in order to participate in a rebuild initiated on some other\r\nsystem. Note that invoking of the XES rebuild service (macro IXLREBLD) is only one part of the processing\r\nneeded to accomplish the rebuild of a structure used for signalling. Message IXC467I is issued by each\r\nsystem as it initiates the processing needed to accomplish the rebuild from the perspective of the XCF\r\nsignalling service.\r\nSTOPPING\r\nThe signalling path is being removed from service. Stop path processing is initiated for errors or in response\r\nto actions taken by the system to which the path is connected. Stopping a list structure causes all list paths\r\nthrough that structure to be stopped as well (in the indicated direction).\r\ndir\r\nThe direction specified for the indicated request.

DIAG038: 5\r\nAn I/O error occurred while the signalling path was being restarted.\r\nATTENTION INTERRUPT\r\nAn I/O interrupt was presented for a path that was not engaged in any I/O operations. Usually this means the\r\nsystem on the other end of the signalling path is restarting or stopping its side of the path while this system is in\r\nthe midst of restarting its side of the path.\r\nI/O APPARENTLY STALLED\r\nSignal transfer over the signalling path appears to have stalled. The path is restarted in an attempt to restore the\r\npath to working order.\r\nThese are the possible causes for the stalled I/O:\r\nv The stalled I/O could be caused by stalled members.\r\nv For signalling paths using a coupling facility structure, the stalled I/O could be caused by CF issues.\r\nv The stalled I/O could be caused by related errors.\r\nv The stalled I/O could be caused by performance issues on the target system.\r\nv The stalled I/O could be caused by poor signalling configuration.\r\nINCOMPLETE SIGNAL\r\nAn I/O transfer completed, but not all the data in the signal was received. The path is restarted so that the\r\nsignal can be resent.\r\nSIGNAL OUT OF SEQUENCE\r\nA signal did not arrive in the expected order. The path is restarted to re-synchronize the two sides of the\r\nsignalling path.\r\nWRONG BUFFER SIZE\r\nThe signal was longer than expected. The path is restarted to re-synchronize the two sides of the signalling path.\r\nI/O QUEUE INCONSISTENT\r\nAn I/O queue does not appear to be intact. The path is restarted to ensure successful transfer of the signals.\r\nRESUME I/O FAILED\r\nA suspended I/O operation could not be resumed successfully.\r\nI/O ERROR. DIAG038: 14\r\nAn I/O operation ended abnormally or unexpectedly. The path is restarted in an attempt to restore it to working\r\norder.\r\nINTERVENTION REQUIRED\r\nAn I/O operation failed due to an intervention required condition. This could mean that the system on the other\r\nend of the signalling path is restarting or stopping its side of the path. It could also mean that underlying\r\nhardware is no longer operational. Manual intervention may be required.\r\nNEED SIGNAL CONNECTIVITY\r\nThere is no signalling connectivity with at least one other system in the sysplex. This path is restarted in hopes\r\nthat it may be able to establish connectivity.\r\nCIRCULAR PATH\r\nThe inbound and outbound side of a signalling path must be under the control of two distinct systems. This\r\nsignalling path may have been misconfigured or defined to XCF incorrectly because it appears to have both sides\r\nof the path defined to the same system. However, some of the data used to detect this situation is inconsistent.\r\nThe path is restarted in order to resolve this question.\r\nINCORRECT SIGNAL LENGTH\r\nWhile negotiating the parameters to be used for signal transfer, one of the systems determined that the requested\r\nsignal length was inappropriate. The path is restarted to resolve the problem.\r\nXCF RECOVERY\r\nXCF recovery processing could not determine whether signal transfer over the signalling path was operational.\r\nThe path is restarted in order to ensure that both sides of the path are synchronized.\r\nUNQUIESCE I/O\r\nThe signalling path was quiesced for signal transfer. In this case, the path was restarted as part of the processing\r\nused to unquiesce the I/O.\r\nI/O TERMINATION\r\nAn I/O operation was terminated due to an error (such as a machine check or program check) that occurred\r\nwhile a system routine was in control. The signalling path is restarted to restore it service.\r\nRESET PARAMETERS\r\nDue to changes in resources associated with the signalling path, it is being restarted to reset its parameters of\r\noperation. For example, the maximum list set entry count of each list path is adjusted according to the number\r\nlists currently in use as signalling paths through a list structure. Or a change to the MAXMSG value (amount of\r\nbuffer space) for the signalling path may require modification of parameters related to I/O transfer.\r\nINTERVENTION REQUIRED WHILE LINKING\r\nAn I/O operation initiated as part of an attempt to establish the signalling path failed due to an intervention\r\nrequired condition. This situation could be due to an IPL of the system on the other side of the signalling path.\r\nAlso, the other system may have restarted or stopped its side of the signalling path.\r\nNORMAL COMPLETION OF START\r\nStart path processing completed without error. The path appears to be usable for signalling. A path restart is\r\nrequested to initiate the processing required to establish signalling connectivity via this path.\r\nSTART CONVERTED TO RESTART\r\nA system initiated path start request was converted to a path restart request.\r\nINCORRECT SIGNAL FORMAT\r\nWhile negotiating the parameters to be used for signal transfer, one of the systems determined that the requested\r\nsignal format was inappropriate. The path is restarted to resolve the problem.\r\nSTART I/O FAILED\r\nAn attempt to start an I/O operation failed. The path is restarted in an attempt to restore it to working order.\r\nI/O ERROR. DIAG038: 37\r\nAn I/O operation ended abnormally or unexpectedly. The path is restarted in an attempt to restore it to working\r\norder.\r\nINCORRECT VECTOR INDEX\r\nThe vector index specified when invoking the Local Vector Service (macro IXLVECTR) is not valid. The path is\r\nrestarted in order to re-establish a valid vector index.\r\nINCORRECT LIST ENTRY VERSION NUMBER\r\nThe signal was not transferred with the expected validation data. The path is restarted to re-synchronize the two\r\nsides of the signalling path.\r\nIf this error is repetitive, use SETXCF to either rebuild the signalling structure or to stop all pathins and pathouts\r\nto the signalling structure and then restart the paths.\r\nNote: This condition may be caused by replying DOWN to message IXC402D prior to a system being\r\ncompletely reset.\r\nSYSPLEX PARTITIONING OF LOCAL SYSTEM\r\nThe request was initiated because the local system is no longer in the sysplex. If the local system was active in\r\nthe sysplex, it enters a wait-state upon completion of sysplex partitioning. If the system was attempting to IPL\r\ninto a sysplex but never became active, all paths are stopped before the operator is prompted by message IXC207A to respecify a new COUPLExx parmlib member.\r\nSYSPLEX PARTITIONING OF REMOTE SYSTEM\r\nThe system to which the path had last established signalling connectivity is being removed from the sysplex. The\r\ninitiator of the partitioning request specifies whether the systems remaining in the sysplex are to retain the\r\nsignalling paths used to communicate with the removed system. If the paths are not to be retained, this path\r\nbecomes undefined to XCF for signalling upon completion of the stop. To redefine the path to XCF for signalling,\r\nthe operator must enter a SETXCF START path command. If the paths are to be retained after the system is\r\nremoved from the sysplex, this path remains defined to XCF for signalling and is restarted.\r\nOTHER SYSTEM STOPPING ITS SIDE OF PATH\r\nThe other system to which the signalling path is connected is stopping its side of the path. If the path is no\r\nlonger needed, this system also stops its side of the path. For example, if a system stops using a list structure for\r\noutbound signal traffic, all the systems using the structure for inbound signal traffic can stop their inbound list\r\npaths. If the path is still needed, this system restarts the path so that it is ready to re-establish the signalling path\r\nif the other side should ever start the path again.\r\nOTHER SIDE IS SAME DIRECTION\r\nXCF tried to establish signalling connectivity between two systems, but the signalling path was defined in the\r\nsame direction on both systems. A signalling path must have an outbound side and an inbound side. If both\r\nsides are defined in the same directions, signals cannot be transferred via this signalling path.\r\nEither of the two systems involved can detect the problem. The error is not necessarily detected by the system\r\nthat has the incorrect definition. If it appears that the other system is at fault, the path is restarted to ensure that\r\nthis side of the path remains ready to establish connectivity when the other side of the path is correctly defined.\r\nThe restart may also allow the other system to recognize that its path is not defined correctly. If it appears that\r\nthis system is at fault the path is stopped.\r\nOPERATOR REQUEST\r\nThe operator entered a SETXCF command which caused the indicated request to be initiated.\r\nSTRUCTURE FAILURE\r\nThis system detected structure failure.\r\nUNABLE TO START LIST MONITORING\r\nThis system was unable to establish list monitoring. The signalling service cannot ensure correct operation\r\nwithout the ability to monitor list transitions. Depending on the list involved, failure to establish monitoring may\r\nimpact a particular list path or use of the whole structure.\r\nRETRY LIMIT EXCEEDED\r\nThe retry count for the signalling path exceeded the retry limit. The path is stopped because it is considered to\r\nbe non-operational. The problem can be:\r\nv I/O errors occurred on the path.\r\nv An incorrect COUPLExx parmlib member was specified.\r\nv The specified COUPLExx parmlib member had signalling path definition errors. For instance, the retry limit\r\ncan be exceeded if both sides of a signalling path were started in the same direction. See the explanation for\r\nthe message text OTHER SIDE IS SAME DIRECTION.\r\nSUBCHANNEL NOT OPERATIONAL FOR RESUME\r\nThe subchannel is not operational for one of the following reasons:\r\nv No subchannel is provided.\r\nv The subchannel did not have a valid device number assigned.\r\nv The subchannel is not enabled.\r\nREBUILD FAILED, UNABLE TO USE ORIGINAL\r\nA structure rebuild was initiated. The rebuild attempt failed and this system is unable to use the original list\r\nstructure.\r\nSTART REQUEST FAILED\r\nA request to start a signalling path failed. Message IXC305I explains why the start request failed.\r\nCONNECTED TO NON-XCF SIGNALLER\r\nThe other end of this signalling path is not under XCF control. Either the signalling path is not connected to a\r\nsystem in the sysplex, or another application is trying to use the signalling path. A signalling path can only be\r\nused for communication between two systems active in the same sysplex and both ends of the path must be\r\nunder XCF's exclusive control in order to ensure correct operation of the signalling service.\r\nNON-XCF SIGNALLER USING PATH\r\nA non-XCF application tried to use this system's signalling path. Paths used by XCF must be dedicated\r\nexclusively to XCF in order to ensure correct operation of the signalling service.\r\nHALT I/O FAILED\r\nThe system tried to stop all I/O through this path, but the request failed. For a CTC signalling path, the CTC\r\ndevice is probably in a permanent error state.\r\nPURGE I/O FAILED\r\nAn attempt to remove all I/O queued for the signalling path failed.\r\nCONTROL OPERATION FAILED\r\nXCF performs various read and write operations to manage use of a list structure for signalling. One of these\r\ncontrol operations failed.\r\nINTERNAL ERROR\r\nAn XCF internal error occurred.\r\nCONNECT TOKEN NO LONGER VALID\r\nThe connect token used when invoking XES services to access the list structure is no longer valid. The connect\r\ntoken is returned by the IXLCONN service.\r\nLOST CONNECTIVITY TO STRUCTURE\r\nThis system lost connectivity to the coupling facility that contains the structure.\r\nNOT DEFINED AS PATHOUT OR PATHIN\r\nThe list structure is defined for neither outbound signal traffic nor inbound signal traffic.\r\nPROPAGATING STOP OF STRUCTURE\r\nA stop request is in progress for a list structure. All the associated list paths must be stopped as well.\r\nNO LIST AVAILABLE FOR USE\r\nA list path no longer has a list allocated within the list structure for its use. For example, a rebuilt structure may\r\nnot have a list for the path, whereas the original structure did.\r\nUNABLE TO USE REBUILT STRUCTURE\r\nThe list structure has been rebuilt, but this system cannot use the rebuilt structure. Although this system may\r\nlose signalling capacity by stopping its use of the list structure, it does not lose signalling connectivity. So the\r\nother systems in the sysplex are permitted to continue on with the rebuilt structure, and this system disconnects\r\nfrom the structure.\r\nUNABLE TO START REBUILD\r\nThe list structure is not usable. An attempt was made to rebuild the structure, but the rebuild could not be\r\nstarted.\r\nSTRUCTURE IN USE BY INCOMPATIBLE CONNECTION\r\nThe list structure is not usable. It is being used incompatibly by another connector.\r\nSTRUCTURE ELEMENT COUNT TOO SMALL\r\nThe list structure is not usable. The number of list elements defined for the structure is less than the minimum\r\nrequired by XCF to be able to use the structure for signaling.\r\nSTRUCTURE ENTRY COUNT TOO SMALL\r\nThe list structure is not usable. The number of list entries defined for the structure is less than the minimum\r\nrequired by XCF to be able to use the structure for signaling.\r\nCONNECTOR HANG\r\nA structure-related process associated with this list structure appears to be hung because of failure to receive a\r\nconnector response. The system has stopped signaling paths through the structure to cause XCF to disconnect\r\nand thereby relieve the hang.\r\nLOST CONNECTIVITY TO FACILITY\r\nThis system lost connectivity to the coupling facility containing the structure.\r\nMORE LISTS NEEDED\r\nThis system determined that the structure was not allocated with enough lists for all the signalling list paths that\r\nare needed.\r\nMORE SPACE NEEDED\r\nThis system determined that more space was needed in the structure.\r\nPARTICIPANT\r\nThis system is participating in a rebuild of the structure. The rebuild was initiated by the operator or some other\r\nconnector.\r\nPARTICIPANT, STOP REBUILD\r\nThis system is participating in a rebuild of the structure. The rebuild was initiated by the operator or some other\r\nconnector. However, the rebuild process is being stopped. The protocols for XES rebuild processing require this\r\nsystem to participate in completion of the rebuild process, so the necessary processing is initiated.\r\nIXLVECTR TOKEN NOT VALID\r\nThe vector token used by this system when invoking the Local Vector Service (macro IXLVECTR) is no longer\r\nvalid. A structure failure may cause a vector token to become invalidated. The system initiated rebuild\r\nprocessing in an attempt to connect to a new instance of the structure. A new vector token is assigned for the\r\nnew structure.\r\nMORE SYSTEMS EXPECTED\r\nThe system initiated rebuild processing to allocate the list structure with more lists for signalling paths that new\r\nsystems entering the sysplex are expected to need in order to establish full signalling connectivity. New systems\r\nare expected to enter the sysplex when the primary sysplex couple data set is replaced by a couple data set\r\nformatted with a larger MAXSYSTEM specification.\r\n DIAG038:n\r\nDiagnostic data that is provided to assist IBM service personnel with problem determination.\r\n DIAG039:n\r\nDiagnostic data that is provided to assist IBM service personnel with problem determination.\r\n DIAG079:n\r\nDiagnostic data that is provided to assist IBM service personnel with problem determination.\r\n DIAG073:nnnnn\r\nDiagnostic data that is provided to assist IBM service personnel with problem determination.\r\nSystem action: The system initiates processing of the indicated path request.\r\nRESTARTING\r\nSignals queued for transfer over this path are delayed until restart processing re-establishes the path (or the path\r\ncompletes stop processing). If this path was the only one available for communicating with the other system,\r\nsignalling connectivity is lost. If the path can be re-established, signalling connectivity will be restored. When\r\nthere is no signalling connectivity, requests by applications and sub-systems to send signals are rejected. Message IXC466I is issued if the path is re-established.\r\nREBUILDING\r\nNo signal transfer occurs through the list structure while the rebuild is in progress. Signals sent by applications\r\nor sub-systems are diverted to other signalling paths while the structure is being rebuilt. If there are no other\r\nsignalling paths available, the signals are queued until rebuild processing completes. If rebuild processing takes\r\ntoo long, the queued signals may use up all the buffer space available to the XCF signalling service. When the\r\nbuffer supply is exhausted, requests by applications and sub-systems to send signals are rejected. Message IXC465I is issued to indicate completion of rebuild processing from the perspective of the XCF signalling service.\r\nSTOPPING\r\nSignals queued for transfer over this path are resent as needed when stop processing completes. If this path was\r\nthe only one available for communicating with the other system, signalling connectivity is lost. Other paths may\r\nneed to be started to restore signalling connectivity. Signals queued for transfer over the stopped path remain\r\nqueued until signalling connectivity is restored, or the target system is removed from the sysplex. When there is\r\nno signalling connectivity, requests by applications and sub-systems to send signals are rejected. Message IXC307I is issued if stop path processing completes successfully.\r\nSystem programmer response: Use this information for problem determination.\r\nTake the following step according to the possible cause for the stalled I/O:\r\nv If the stalled I/O is caused by stalled members, use a sysplex failure management (SFM) policy that provides a\r\nMEMSTALLTIME specification.

All the systems will enter a nonrestartable wait state.\r\nIf the ETR clock is synchronized, this system will rejoin the other systems in the sysplex.\r\nv Do not restart this system.\r\nIf this system is not restarted, another system in the sysplex issues message IXC402D.

The system which is to be removed must be system reset\r\nbefore the operator replies DOWN to this message.\r\nNote:\r\n1. The system reset is needed to ensure that the system image being removed from the sysplex no longer has the\r\ncapability to perform I/O to devices which may be shared with other systems that remain active in the sysplex. If\r\nthis reset is not performed before replying to this message, then severe data integrity problems may result. When\r\nthe subject system is removed from the sysplex, XCF will clean up resources (such as locks, ENQs, and reserves)\r\nwhich are held by that system, and make them available to other systems in the sysplex. If the subject system is\r\nin fact still active, and operating in the belief that it still holds these resources, unpredictable results may occur.\r\n2. When this message appears, it is important that the appropriate system reset action be taken, and that this\r\nmessage be replied to in a timely fashion. While this message is outstanding, XCF must still consider the subject\r\nsystem to be (at least potentially) active in the sysplex, and therefore XCF cannot clean up resources (such as\r\nlocks, ENQs, and reserves) which are held by that system. These resources will remain unavailable to all other\r\nsystems in the sysplex until this message is replied to, and the system completes the process of being removed\r\nfrom the sysplex. Extended unavailability of these resources is likely to cause delays, timeouts, or other problems\r\nfor the other systems in the sysplex.\r\n3. There are instances when this message will be issued and the appropriate action must be taken even though there\r\nis an SFM policy active in the sysplex. If SFM cannot successfully isolate the system image being removed,\r\nmanual intervention will be required. This message will be issued and must be responded to.\r\nIn the message text:\r\nsysname\r\nThe name of the system XCF is removing from the sysplex.\r\nSystem action: Processing continues. The system is not removed from the sysplex until the operator performs a\r\nsystem reset and replies DOWN.\r\nOperator response: Before replying DOWN, a system reset must be performed on system sysname . Perform the\r\nhardware SYSTEM RESET or LOAD (IPL) function to ensure that system sysname is reset. If system sysname is to be\r\ndumped (for example, via Standalone Dump), take care to perform a SYSTEM-RESET-NORMAL or LOAD-NORMAL\r\nfunction that does not clear the system storage. Once system sysname is system reset, reply DOWN.\r\nNote that several acceptable alternatives to SYSTEM RESET or LOAD exist. You may replyDOWNafter any action\r\nor condition listed below occurs for system sysname :\r\nv SYSTEM RESET-NORMAL\r\nv LOAD-NORMAL\r\nv INITIATION OF STANDALONE DUMP (via LOAD-NORMAL)\r\nv SYSTEM RESET-CLEAR\r\nv LOAD-CLEAR\r\nv POWER-ON-RESET\r\nv NO POWER\r\n\u00ae\r\nto CPC where system sysname resides\r\nv Deactivation of the logical partition where system sysname resides\r\nv Reset of the logical partition where systemsysname resides.\r\nv Processor on which sysname is running is in a checkstopped state.\r\nNote: Some of these system-reset alternatives might cause the issuance of messages on remote systems that are\r\nconnected by the Ficon channel to channel connections to the target system.\r\nDepending on your hardware and your hardware operational procedures, the above functions may be invoked\r\nexplicitly or implicitly. For example, on an HMC you may implicitly perform one of the above hardware functions by\r\ndragging a CPC object or an image object and dropping the object on the ACTIVATE task. The hardware function\r\nperformed depends on the activation profile associated with the object.\r\nIt is important to note that, if system sysname is in a disabled wait state, that is not, by itself, sufficient to guarantee\r\nthat system sysname can no longer access I/O devices that may be shared with other active systems in the sysplex.\r\nHowever, if the system is configured so that a system reset is automatically performed when a disabled wait state is\r\nentered, then that is sufficient and there is no need to manually reset the system again.\r\nSource: Cross System Coupling Facility (SCXCF)\r\nModule: IXCS2WTO\r\nRouting code: 1,2\r\nDescriptor code: 4", "IXC275I": " {RESOLVED COUPLE DATA SETS| COUPLE DATA SETS SPECIFIED IN COUPLE xx} ARE\r\nPRIMARY:primdsnameON VOLSERprivolser ALTERNATE: [altdsname] {ON VOLSER|NONE\r\nUSED|NONE SPECIFIED} [altvolser]\r\nExplanation: XCF has detected an inconsistency in the sysplex couple data sets specified in COUPLExx.

Note that storage-class memory is not considered to be available if the coupling\r\nfacility cannot accommodate the specified SCMALGORITHM.\r\nSCMMAXSIZE REQUIREMENT MET BY PREFERRED CF\r\nThis coupling facility does not have enough total storage-class memory to accommodate the CFRM\r\npolicy SCMMAXSIZE specification for this structure, and there is another coupling facility which does.\r\nNote that storage-class memory is not considered to be available if the coupling facility cannot\r\naccommodate the specified SCMALGORITHM.\r\nMORE STORAGE-CLASS MEMORY AVAILABLE IN PREFERRED CF\r\nThis coupling facility does not have enough storage-class memory to allocate the structure with the\r\namount specified by the CFRM policy and there is another coupling facility that also does not have\r\nenough storage-class memory but has more than this one.

Note that storage-class memory\r\nis not considered to be available if the coupling facility cannot accommodate the specified\r\nSCMALGORITHM.\r\nNON-VOLATILITY REQUIREMENT MET BY PREFERRED CF\r\nThis coupling facility is volatile, non-volatility was requested, and at least one coupling facility exists\r\ncoupling facility that is non-volatile.\r\nFAILURE ISOLATION REQUIREMENT MET BY PREFERRED CF\r\nThis coupling facility is not failure-isolated from all connectors, non-volatility was requested, and at\r\nleast one coupling facility exists that is failure-isolated from all connectors.\r\nSTAND-ALONE REQUIREMENT MET BY PREFERRED CF\r\nThis coupling facility is not stand-alone, non-volatility was requested, and at least one coupling facility\r\nexists that is stand-alone.\r\nEXCLLIST REQUIREMENT FULLY MET BY PREFERRED CF\r\nThis coupling facility contains a structure from the EXCLLIST, and at least one coupling facility exists\r\nthat does not contain any structures from the EXCLLIST.\r\nEXCLLIST REQUIREMENT MET BY PREFERRED CF\r\nThis coupling facility contains a simplex structure from the EXCLLIST, and at least one coupling facility\r\nexists that contains only old or new structure instances from the EXCLLIST.\r\nSPACE REQUIREMENT MET BY PREFERRED CF\r\nThe following conditions exist:\r\nv System-managed duplexing rebuild is a possibility for the structure.\r\nv The coupling facility is not connected by CF-to-CF links to any other coupling facilities in the\r\nPREFLIST that have adequate space to allocate the structure if a duplexing rebuild is to be started.\r\nv At least one coupling facility exists that is connected by CF-to-CF links to a coupling facility that does\r\nhave adequate space to allocate the structure.\r\nREMOTE FACILITY REQUIREMENT MET BY PREFERRED CF\r\nThe following conditions exist:\r\nv System-managed duplexing rebuild is a possibility for the structure.\r\nv This coupling facility is not connected by CF-to-CF links to any other coupling facilities in the\r\nPREFLIST,\r\nv At least one coupling facility exists that is connected by CF-to-CF links to a remote facility, but the\r\nremote facility does not have adequate space to allocate the structure if a duplexing rebuild is to be\r\nstarted.\r\nPREFERRED CF HIGHER IN PREFLIST\r\nThis coupling facility is lower in the PREFLIST than another coupling facility that is suitable for\r\nallocation.\r\nENFORCEORDER(YES) AND PREFERRED CF HIGHER IN PREFLIST\r\nThis coupling facility is lower in the PREFLIST than another coupling facility that is suitable for\r\nallocation; because ENFORCEORDER(YES) was also specified for the structure in the CFRM policy, XCF\r\ndid not re-order the PREFLIST.\r\nGREATER SFM WEIGHT CALCULATED FOR PREFERRED CF\r\nThis coupling facility has a lower SFM weight than another coupling facility that is suitable for\r\nallocation. For a structure without any active connectors, the SFM weight of each coupling facility is the\r\nsum of the SFM weights of all systems connected to that coupling facility. For a structure with active\r\nconnectors, only systems with active connectors are used to determine the SFM weight of the coupling\r\nfacility. Note that all systems are considered to have equal SFM weight if no SFM policy is active.\r\nRESTRICTED BY REBUILD USERS\r\nThe coupling facility was not selected for rebuild because it does not support the highest in-use CONID.\r\nMAX STRUCTURES ALLOCATED\r\nAll available structure slots in this coupling facility are already being used.\r\nINSUFFICIENT STORAGE-CLASS MEMORY\r\nThe old structure has objects in SCM and the CF can allocate objects in SCM but cannot allocate all in-use\r\nobjects (staying within the SIZE policy constraint), given the total amount of SCM configured to the CF.\r\nCOMPUTED OBJECT COUNTS UNACCEPTABLE\r\nThe old structure has objects in SCM and calculations show that the CF cannot allocate all in-use objects and\r\nremain within the SIZE and SCMMAXSIZE policy constraints.\r\nhexdata\r\nSee documentation for message IXC574I.\r\nstrrsn\r\nThe failure reason. One of the following:\r\nSTRUCTURE NOT ALLOCATED\r\nWhen starting a rebuild process, the structure is found to no longer be allocated in a coupling facility.\r\nCONNECTOR HANG\r\nThe rebuild is stopped in an attempt to relieve a connector hang during the processing of a rebuild-related\r\nevent. The system has issued message IXL040E or IXL041E to report the failure of the connector to provide\r\nan expected response to the event. The SFM policy specifies a value of CFSTRHANGTIME that permits the\r\nsystem to take automatic action to relieve connector hangs.\r\nDUMP SERIALIZATION HELD ON STRUCTURE\r\nThe rebuild is stopped because dump serialization prevented access to either the old or the new structure\r\ninstance.\r\nDEALLOCATION OF THE STRUCTURE\r\nThe rebuild is stopped because the structure was deallocated (for example, the last connector disconnected\r\nfrom a non-persistent structure).\r\nCONNECTOR DISCONNECTED FROM STRUCTURE\r\nThe rebuild is stopped in response to a connection disconnecting from the structure. A user-managed rebuild\r\ncannot continue after the last connector disconnects, even if the structure persists.\r\nFAILURE OF A SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESS PHASE\r\nA phase of a system-managed process is unsuccessful.\r\nFAILURE OF THE STRUCTURE\r\nThe rebuild is stopped because of structure failure of either the new or the old structure.\r\nLOSS OF CONNECTIVITY TO THE STRUCTURE\r\nThe rebuild is stopped because of loss of connectivity to either the coupling facility where the old structure\r\nis allocated or the coupling facility where the new structure is allocated.\r\nA CHANGE IN THE CFRM ACTIVE POLICY FOR THE STRUCTURE\r\nThe rebuild is stopped because of a change in either the CFRM active policy DUPLEX specification for the\r\nstructure or a change in the structure preference list, which causes that the facility in which either the old or\r\nnew structure is allocated is no longer in the preference list. When the CFRM active policy DUPLEX\r\nspecification for a structure is changed to DUPLEX(DISABLED) for a change policy request, duplexing\r\nrebuild is stopped by MVS when the change is processed. Duplexing rebuild is also stopped when the\r\nfacility in which the old or new structure is allocated is removed from the preference list.\r\nREQUEST FROM AN OPERATOR\r\nThe rebuild is stopped because the operator issues the SETXCF STOP,REBUILD command.\r\nCONNECTOR SPECIFIC REASON\r\nThe rebuild is stopped because of the reason provided by the issuer of IXLREBLD. IXLREBLD is the\r\nprogramming interface for structure rebuild processing.\r\nFAILURE OF THE NEW STRUCTURE\r\nThe rebuild is stopped because of structure failure of the new structure.\r\nFAILURE OF THE OLD STRUCTURE\r\nThe rebuild is stopped because of structure failure of the old structure.\r\nLOSS OF CONNECTIVITY TO THE NEW STRUCTURE\r\nThe rebuild is stopped because of loss of connectivity to the coupling facility where the new structure was\r\nlocated.\r\nLOSS OF CONNECTIVITY TO THE OLD STRUCTURE\r\nThe rebuild is stopped because of loss of connectivity to the coupling facility where the old structure was\r\nlocated.\r\nTHE CFRM ACTIVE POLICY INDICATES REALLOCATE NOT ALLOWED\r\nThe structure is bypassed by REALLOCATE processing because ALLOWREALLOCATE(NO) is specified in\r\nthe CFRM active policy.\r\nA CFRM ACTIVE POLICY DATA AREA COULD NOT BE OBTAINED\r\nA system-managed process (for example, rebuild) cannot be initiated because the necessary CFRM active\r\npolicy data area cannot be obtained.\r\nSTRUCTURE WITH NO CONNECTORS HAS NEVER BEEN SYSTEM-MANAGED DUPLEXED\r\nA system-managed duplexing rebuild cannot be initiated because there are no connections to the structure\r\nand the structure has not previously been duplexed using system-managed processing.\r\nTHE CFRM CDS DOES NOT SUPPORT SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESS\r\nThe CFRM couple data set does not support system-managed process (for example, rebuild), because the\r\nCFRM couple data set is not formatted at or above the minimum version for the system-managed process\r\nrequested. Use the DISPLAY XCF,COUPLE,TYPE=CFRM command to determine the format of the CFRM\r\ncouple data set. To support system-managed rebuild the CFRM couple data set should be formatted\r\nspecifying ITEM NAME(SMREBLD) NUMBER(1) . For system-managed duplexing rebuild, ITEM\r\nNAME(SMDUPLEX) NUMBER(1) implicitly formats a CFRM couple data set that supports both\r\nsystem-managed rebuild and system-managed duplexing rebuild.\r\nAT LEAST ONE CONNECTOR HAS LOST CONNECTIVITY\r\nA system-managed process (for example, rebuild) cannot be initiated because one or more of the connectors\r\nto the target structure has lost connectivity.\r\nCONNECTORS DO NOT SUPPORT SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESSES\r\nThe structure has at least one active connector, and at least one of the connectors (active or failed-persistent)\r\ndoes not specify IXLCONN ALLOWAUTO=YES when connecting.\r\nNO SUITABLE COUPLING FACILITY IN PREFERENCE LIST\r\nThe requested system-managed process cannot be initiated for one or more of the following reasons:\r\nv The preference list is empty.\r\nv The preference list contains no other coupling facility at or above the minimum CFLEVEL required for the\r\ncurrent process.\r\nv The structure already exists in the only suitable coupling facility. The same coupling facility can only be\r\nselected as the target for the system-managed rebuild if a CFRM policy change is pending. Either the\r\npolicy changes does not involve updates to the SIZE or INITSIZE values, or the policy change does\r\ninvolve updates to SIZE or INITSIZE and all the structure connectors specify IXLCONN\r\nALLOWALTER=YES.\r\nv A potentially suitable coupling facility does not permit structure allocation.\r\nALLOCATION OF DUPLEXING REBUILD NEW STRUCTURE NOT FEASIBLE\r\nAllocation of the rebuild new structure instance in support of a duplexing rebuild is not feasible. Message IXC574I contains additional diagnostic information.\r\nTHE STRUCTURE DOES NOT SUPPORT SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESSES\r\nThe structure does not support system-managed processes (for example, rebuild) for one of the following\r\nreasons:\r\nv The structure is not allocated in a coupling facility at or above the minimum CFLEVEL required for the\r\ncurrent process by a system supporting system-managed processing.\r\nv The structure has connections that have not been reconciled into the CFRM active policy.\r\nStructure cleanup is in progress for the structure.\r\nA DUPLEXING REBUILD IS NOT ALLOWED FOR THE STRUCTURE\r\nThe structure does not support duplexing rebuild for one of the following reasons:\r\nv DUPLEX(DISABLED) is specified or defaulted to in the CFRM active policy for the structure.\r\nv There are failed-persistent connections that are unavailable until a larger CFRM couple data set is made\r\navailable.\r\nv A user-managed duplexing rebuild cannot be started because either user-managed duplexing rebuilds are\r\nnot supported for the structure type, or at least one active or failed-persistent connection specifies or\r\ndefaults to IXLCONN ALLOWDUPREBLD=NO.\r\nv A system-managed duplexing rebuild cannot be started because either the structure has at least one active\r\nconnector, and none of the connectors (active or failed-persistent) specifies IXLCONN ALLOWAUTO=YES\r\nwhen connecting, or a system-managed duplexing rebuild is not supported when a CFRM policy change\r\nis pending for the structure.\r\nNO COUPLING FACILITY PROVIDED BETTER OR EQUIVALENT CONNECTIVITY\r\nNo other facility has better connectivity than the current one. The rebuild will cause a degradation in\r\nconnectivity as determined by SFM system weights, if accepted.\r\nNO SUITABLE COUPLING FACILITY FOR REBUILD WITH LOCATION=OTHER\r\nA rebuild start request will be rejected because LOCATION=OTHER is necessary and no other eligible\r\ncoupling facility is found in the preference list.\r\nAT LEAST ONE CONNECTOR DOES NOT SUPPORT REBUILD\r\nAt least one of the active connectors to the structure does not support rebuild.\r\nA REBUILD STOP IS IN PROGRESS FOR THE STRUCTURE\r\nRebuild stop is in progress for the structure.\r\nTHE STRUCTURE HAS FAILED\r\nThe rebuild start request is rejected for one of the following reasons:\r\nv The request is to start a duplexing rebuild and the structure has failed. Duplexing rebuild is not allowed\r\nwhen the structure is in the failed state.\r\nv The rebuild start request is to result in a system-managed rebuild. System-managed rebuild is not allowed\r\nwhen the structure is in the failed state.\r\nA STRUCTURE REBUILD PROCESS IS IN PROGRESS\r\nThe structure rebuild process is already in progress for the structure. The structure rebuild process type can\r\nbe either rebuild or duplexing rebuild. For a duplexing rebuild, the in-progress processing can be in one of\r\nthe following status:\r\nv The structure is duplexed. For a user-managed duplexing rebuild, only one instance is allocated because\r\nthe last user connected to both instances has disconnected in between another user's IXLCONN and\r\nIXLCONN REBUILD requests.\r\nv Process is in progress but has not reached duplexing established.\r\nv Process has been stopped with KEEP=OLD.\r\nv Process has been stopped with KEEP=NEW.\r\nOF AN UNEXPECTED ERROR WHEN BUILDING THE LIST OF ELIGIBLE CFS\r\nAn unexpected error is encountered while building the list of a coupling facilities where an instance of the\r\nstructure can be allocated. When this processing accesses an allocated instance to determine the structure\r\nparameters, either connectivity to the CF is lost or the command to the CF fails unexpectedly.\r\nTHERE IS NO CONNECTIVITY TO COUPLING FACILITY\r\nA CF in which the structure is allocated is not connected to all the required systems.\r\nOF A PENDING POLICY CHANGE TO SIZE/INITSIZE BUT ALTER NOT ALLOWED\r\nAn administrative policy change is pending. The pending policy change includes a change to the SIZE or\r\nINITSIZE specifications. At least one of the active or failed-persistent connections to the structure does not\r\nallow alter processing and system-managed rebuild is required, so the structure rebuild process cannot be\r\nused to make the pending policy changes active.\r\nOF A PENDING POLICY CHANGE TO DELETE THE STRUCTURE DEFINITION\r\nAn administrative policy change is pending. The pending policy change is to delete the policy definition for\r\nthe structure. The change is to delete the structure from the CFRM active policy, so the structure rebuild\r\nprocess cannot be used to make the pending policy changes active.\r\nUNEXPECTED ERROR OCCURRED\r\nAn unexpected error occurred. Contact the IBM Support Center.\r\nhexrsn\r\nUsed only with REASON UNKNOWN, can be provided to IBM Support to help identify the problem.\r\nREALLOCATE EVALUATION PENDING\r\nThe REALLOCATE process is in progress and the allocated structure is pending evaluation of its current\r\nlocation. The REALLOCATE process examines each allocated structure to determine whether the location of any\r\nof the instances needs to be adjusted or a pending policy needs to be activated.\r\nTARGET OF REALLOCATE PROCESS\r\nThe REALLOCATE process is in progress or stopping and the structure is selected by the REALLOCATE process\r\nto have its location adjusted or pending policy activated. After being marked as the target of the REALLOCATE\r\nprocess, the structure remains the target until one of the following occurs:\r\nv The REALLOCATE process evaluates the next structure or ends.\r\nv The structure is reduplexed, deallocated, or forced.\r\nREALLOCATE STEP(S) INCOMPLETE WHEN REALLOCATE PROCESS ENDED\r\nA request to force the REALLOCATE process to stop caused the REALLOCATE process to end before the\r\ntargeted structure completed all required REALLOCATE steps.\r\nERROR ON SYSTEM systemONmm/dd/yyyyAThh:mm:ss.dd\r\nThe message indicates a failure to initiate a rebuild process for a REALLOCATE step. Message IXC546I is issued\r\nby the indicated system at the indicated date and time.\r\nEXCEPTION ON SYSTEM systemONmm/dd/yyyyAThh:mm:ss.dd\r\nThe message indicates a failure to complete a REALLOCATE step due the stop of a rebuild process. Message IXC522I is issued by the indicated system at the indicated date and time. When the rebuild process is stopped\r\nfor connector specific reason or failure of a system-managed process phase, IXC522I can provide additional\r\ndiagnostic data that may help IBM Support personnel with problem determination.\r\nCOMPLETED ON SYSTEM systemONmm/dd/yyyyAThh:mm:ss.dd\r\nThe message indicates the successful completion of the REALLOCATE steps. Message IXC521I or IXC577I is\r\nissued by the indicated system at the indicated date and time.\r\nEVALUATED ON SYSTEM systemONmm/dd/yyyyAThh:mm:ss.dd\r\nThe message indicates that REALLOCATE did not attempt any steps. Message IXC544I is issued by the indicated\r\nsystem at the indicated date and time.\r\nPOLICY CHANGE MADE\r\nThe structure is allocated in the preferred coupling facility and the pending policy change is made. The policy\r\nchange is made immediately because the structure is allocated in the preferred coupling facility according to the\r\npending policy and the pending policy does not affect the structure size.\r\nCOUPLING FACILITY STRUCTURE ANALYSIS OUTPUT FOR REALLOCATE TEST\r\nFollowing this header is CF-oriented information reflecting the results of the simulated REALLOCATE process.\r\nThis section is only provided if the simulated REALLOCATE process finds a structure that needs relocation or a\r\npending policy change activated.\r\ncfname_a\r\nThe name of coupling facility from the CFRM active policy.\r\ntype\r\nNode type used to identify the coupling facility (See ndetype in IXLYNDE)\r\nmfg\r\nNode manufacturer ID used to identify coupling facility (See ndemfg in IXLYNDE)\r\nplant\r\nNode manufacturer plant ID used to identify coupling facility (See ndeplant in IXLYNDE)\r\nsequence\r\nNode sequence number used to identify coupling facility (See ndesequence in IXLYNDE)\r\npartition\r\nNode LPAR partition number used to identify coupling facility (See ndepartition in IXLYNDE)\r\nside\r\nThe node PP/SI mode indicator and configuration code from the IXLYNDE are used to determine the side value\r\nused to identify the coupling facility.

Structure rebuild processing is used to\r\nadjust the structure location. For user-managed process, message IXC52nI is issued to track processing. For\r\nsystem-managed process, messages IXC57nI and IXC52nI are issued to track processing. Reallocation of simplex\r\nstructures may also have activated pending policy changes.\r\nnumadj2\r\nThe number of duplexed structures for which reallocation is initiated. Structure rebuild processing is used to\r\nadjust the structure location. For user-managed process, message IXC52nI is issued to track processing. For\r\nsystem-managed process, messages IXC57nI and IXC52nI are issued to track processing. Reallocation of duplexed\r\nstructures may also have activated pending policy changes.\r\nnumpol1\r\nThe number of simplex structures for which reallocation is initiated only to activate a pending policy change.\r\nStructure rebuild processing is used to make a pending policy change active. For user-managed process, message IXC52nI is issued to track processing. For system-managed process, messages IXC57nI and IXC52nI are issued to\r\ntrack processing.\r\nnumpol2\r\nThe number of duplexed structures for which reallocation is initiated only to activate a pending policy change.\r\nStructure rebuild processing is used to make a pending policy change active.

No additional message is issued.\r\nnumtotal\r\nThe total number of structures examined by the REALLOCATE process. If the REALLOCATE process completes\r\nwithout being stopped, the total number of examined structures should equal the number of structures that the\r\nprimary CFRM couple data set is formatted to support. If the REALLOCATE process is stopped, processing\r\ncompletes for current target structure and any structures pending evaluation are not processed. There are no\r\nadditional messages for these bypassed structures and they will not be reflected in the total.

However, this event was generated as a\r\nresult of normal processing performed for the signalling path. XCF rejects the start request initiated as a result of\r\nthis expected event.\r\nINTERVENTION REQUIRED\r\nThe signalling path is currently inoperative. XCF will automatically start the signalling path once it receives\r\nnotification that the circumstances that caused the path to be placed in the inoperative state are resolved. This\r\nstart request is rejected because it was not made as a result of such a resolution. For example, a start request\r\ninitiated to resolve a loss of signalling connectivity would be rejected for a CTC signalling path placed in an\r\ninoperative state because the device is not online.\r\nSTRUCTURE NOT DEFINED FOR PATHOUT\r\nThe start of the outbound list path is rejected because the indicated XES list structure is no longer defined to\r\nXCF for outbound use. Between the time that the start list path request was created and the time it was\r\nprocessed, the associated list structure was stopped in the outbound direction.\r\nSTRUCTURE NOT DEFINED FOR PATHIN\r\nThe start of the inbound list path is rejected because the indicated XES list structure is no longer defined to XCF\r\nfor inbound use. Between the time that the start list path request was created and the time it was processed, the\r\nassociated list structure was stopped in the inbound direction.\r\nSTOP PATHOUT FOR STRUCTURE IN PROGRESS\r\nThe start of the outbound list path is rejected because the indicated XES list structure is in the midst of being\r\nstopped for outbound use.

Between the time that the start list path request was created and the time it was\r\nprocessed, the associated list structure was stopped in the inbound direction.\r\nSTRUCTURE INOPERATIVE FOR PATHOUT\r\nThe start of the outbound list path is rejected because the indicated XES list structure has been stopped in the\r\noutbound direction. Between the time that the start list path request was created and the time it was processed,\r\nthe associated list structure was stopped in the outbound direction.\r\nSTRUCTURE INOPERATIVE FOR PATHIN\r\nThe start of the inbound list path is rejected because the indicated XES list structure has been stopped in the\r\ninbound direction. Between the time that the start list path request was created and the time it was processed,\r\nthe associated list structure was stopped in the inbound direction.\r\nSTRUCTURE NAME MUST BEGIN WITH LETTERS IXC\r\nThe start request for the list structure is rejected because the name of the structure does not begin with the\r\ncharacters 'IXC'. Any list structure to be used by XCF for signalling must have a name that begins with the\r\nletters IXC.

If the\r\nCLASS keyword was not explicitly coded, the signalling path was assigned to the default transport class. To start\r\na signalling path in the indicated transport class, the MAXMSG value must be greater than or equal to minimum.\r\nSystem action: The system ignores the start path request. The requested path does not become defined to XCF for\r\nsignalling. Processing continues.\r\nA system initiated start request for a path that is already defined to XCF may be preserved for future processing even\r\nthough the start request is initially rejected. For example, a signalling path could be in the midst of stop processing\r\nas a result of some hardware failure. If the hardware failure was resolved before completion of stop path processing,\r\na system initiated start path request would be rejected due to 'PATH STOP IN PROGRESS'. However, the start path\r\nrequest is preserved and reissued upon completion of stop path processing (provided that the path remains defined\r\nto XCF for signalling).\r\nOperator response: Depending on the message text, do one of the following:\r\nPATH ALREADY STARTED AS OUTBOUND\r\nIf the signalling path should be outbound, no action is needed.\r\nIf PATHIN was specified on the START command, the path cannot be used in different directions by the same\r\nsystem. If the signalling path should be used exclusively for inbound signal traffic, enter a SETXCF\r\nSTOP,PATHOUT command to stop the signalling path. After the stop completes successfully, enter a SETXCF\r\nSTART,PATHIN command to start the signalling path in the inbound direction.\r\nPATH ALREADY STARTED AS INBOUND\r\nIf the signalling path should be inbound, no action is needed.\r\nIf PATHOUT was specified on the START command, the path cannot be used in different directions by the same\r\nsystem. If the signalling path should be used exclusively for outbound signal traffic, enter a SETXCF\r\nSTOP,PATHIN command to stop the signalling path. After the stop completes successfully, enter a SETXCF\r\nSTART,PATHOUT command to start the signalling path in the outbound direction.\r\nPATH STOP IN PROGRESS\r\nEnter the SETXCF START path command after stop processing for the path has completed. Either message IXC307I or message IXC308I is issued when the stop path request is complete (although the message may appear\r\nonly in the system log). Enter a DISPLAY XCF,dircommand specifying the indicated path to determine the state\r\nof the signalling path. If message IXC356I indicates that the status of the signalling path is INOPERATIVE, or if\r\nthe path is not found, stop processing completed.\r\nUNEXPECTED ERROR\r\nEnter the DISPLAY XCF,dirspecifying the indicated signalling path to get detailed information concerning the\r\nindicated path. Note that information will only be displayed if the path is defined to XCF for signalling. Enter\r\nthe SETXCF START command again. If the command continues to be rejected with this response, inform the\r\nsystem programmer. Provide the result of the DISPLAY XCF command if the path was defined to XCF for\r\nsignalling, as well as any diagnostic data presented as part of this start rejected message.\r\nSTRUCTURE NAME MUST BEGIN WITH LETTERS IXC\r\nEnter the SETXCF START,STRUCTURE command specifying a structure name to be used by the XCF signalling\r\nservice. Any structure name defined by the system programmer for signalling must begin with the characters\r\nIXC.\r\nTRANSPORT CLASS classname NOT DEFINED\r\nThe transport class must be defined to XCF before any signalling paths can be started in that class. Enter the\r\nDISPLAY XCF,CLASSDEF command to obtain a list of the transport classes currently defined to the system. If\r\nneeded, use the SETXCF START,CLASSDEF command to define the transport class. Then enter the SETXCF\r\nSTART,PATHOUT command with a valid transport class name.\r\nMAXMSG MUST BE AT LEAST minimum\r\nThere is a mismatch between the MAXMSG value specified for the signalling path and the class length defined\r\nfor the transport class to which the path was to be assigned. If a transport class was not specified, the transport\r\nclass named DEFAULT was assumed. Either the MAXMSG value should be increased, the class length for the\r\ntransport class should be decreased, or the path should be assigned to a different transport class. Consult the\r\nsystem programmer as needed to determine which action is appropriate.\r\nIf the MAXMSG value should be increased, enter the SETXCF START,PATHOUT command with a MAXMSG\r\nvalue that is greater than or equal to minimum. Note that the MAXMSG value chosen by the system programmer\r\nusually exceeds the indicatedminimumvalue in order to ensure reasonable performance for signal delivery. If the\r\ntransport class definition should be changed, enter a SETXCF MODIFY,CLASSDEF command to change the class\r\nlength of the transport class. If the path should be assigned to a different transport class, enter the SETXCF\r\nSTART,PATHOUT command with the appropriate transport class specified.\r\nFor any othertext , no action is needed.\r\nSystem programmer response: Examine the listed operator responses for an appropriate action.\r\nEnsure that the path is defined to the XCF signalling service correctly. Verify that the direction and the MAXMSG\r\nvalue are correctly specified. For an outbound path, verify that the transport class is correctly specified and that the\r\ntransport class definition is consistent with the path definition.\r\nIn the case of an UNEXPECTED ERROR, search problem reporting data bases for a fix for the problem. If no fix\r\nexists, contact the IBM Support Center. Supply any diagnostic data presented as part of the start rejected message,\r\nany output from the DISPLAY XCF command issued for the signalling path, and the XCF component trace table. The\r\ntrace table must be obtained within 30 seconds of completion of the command if XCF detail tracing is enabled, and\r\nwithin a few minutes if just XCF default tracing is in effect.

This might result in\r\nsystem, subsystem, or application outages.\r\nIf the structure has increased in size when rebuilding or duplexing the structure into a CF at the same CFLEVEL in\r\nwhich the original structure is allocated, there may be no need to update the CFRM policy definitions to reflect the\r\nlarger allocated structure size indicated by this message.\r\nSimilarly, when the structure has been allocated larger than the policy INITSIZE value because the structure exploiter\r\nhas requested a larger IXLCONN STRSIZE value, there is no need to update the CFRM policy definitions to reflect\r\nany size-related changes.\r\nEnsure that the increased CF storage allocation for the structure can be accommodated not only within the current\r\nCF, but also in any other CF images in which the structure is eligible to be allocated.\r\nSource: Cross System Coupling Facility (SCXCF)\r\nModule: IXCL2ASR, IXCL2ATH\r\nRouting code: 10", "IXG269I": " SYSTEM LOGGER ENCOUNTERED A DATA ERROR WHILE READING DSN= DSName\r\nExplanation: System logger encountered a data error while trying to read from the log data set specified.\r\nIn the message text:\r\nDSName\r\nThe name of the data set.\r\nSystem action: The request to read the data set fails.\r\nOperator response: Contact the system programmer.\r\nSystem programmer response: Try to re-drive the function.

If\r\nthe log stream remains connected and log data set directory extents records become available, system logger will\r\nretry the offload.\r\nOperator response: Notify the system programmer.\r\nSystem programmer response: The pool of available log data set directory extent records in the active primary\r\nLOGR couple data set must be increased. You can increase the available pool in one of the following two ways:\r\n1. Formatting a new LOGR couple data set.\r\nYou can format a new LOGR couple data set and increase the number of log data set directory extent records\r\nthrough the DSEXTENT keyword on the couple data set format utility. As help in determining the number of\r\nadditional log data set directory extent records to specify, this message includes the total number of log data set\r\ndirectory extent records that are formatted in active primary LOGR couple data set, numTotal , the number of\r\ncurrently in-use log data set directory extent records, numInuse, and the number of currently available log data set\r\ndirectory extent records, numAvail.\r\nTo relieve the critical shortage, you must reduce the number of in-use log data set directory extent records to\r\nbelow 90 percent of the total formatted.\r\nIf the critical shortage is relieved, unless you reduce the number of in-use log data set directory extent records to\r\nbelow 80 percent of the total formatted, a shortage condition will result.\r\n2. Freeing log data set directory extents from existing log streams.\r\nYou can also relieve the shortage by freeing log data set directory extent records being consumed by existing log\r\nstream definitions. You can free log data set directory extent records in two different ways:\r\na. Deleting log stream definitions.\r\nIf you can identify unnecessary log stream definitions that are consuming log data set directory extents,\r\ndeleting the log stream definition will free the log data set directory extents associated with that log stream\r\nback into the available pool.\r\nAs an aid in detecting unnecessary log stream definitions, check the log stream GROUP attribute.

Reducing the retention period for log data.\r\nIf you can identify log streams that are defined with excessive retention periods and these log streams are\r\nconsuming log data set directory extent records, you can free up log data set directory extent records by\r\nreducing the retention period, thus increasing the available pool.\r\nFor TEST group log streams, you need to make the retention period small so that you can quickly delete the\r\ndata. Thus the data occupy less directory extent records.\r\nNote: The system logger does not necessarily react immediately to reductions in the retention period. The rule\r\nfor when system logger will process reductions in the retention period is upon next log data set switch event\r\nfor the log stream.

This line appears only if the member is\r\nin a quiesced state.\r\nFAILED: mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss.dddddd\r\nThe date and time when the member was placed in a failed state. This line appears only if the member is in\r\na failed state.\r\nattributes\r\nOne of the following lines:\r\nJOIN TASK ASSOCIATION\r\nThis line appears if MEMASSOC=TASK was specified on the IXCJOIN invocation that caused the\r\nmember to become active. The active member is associated with the task under which IXCJOIN was\r\nissued.\r\nJOB STEP ASSOCIATION\r\nThis line appears if MEMASSOC=JOBSTEP was specified on the IXCJOIN invocation that caused the\r\nmember to become active. The active member is associated with the job step task under which IXCJOIN\r\nwas issued.\r\nADDRESS SPACE ASSOCIATION\r\nThis line appears if MEMASSOC=ADDRSPACE was specified on the IXCJOIN invocation that caused\r\nthe member to become active. The active member is associated with the address space under which\r\nIXCJOIN was issued.\r\nLASTING MEMBER\r\nThis line appears if LASTING=YES was specified on the IXCJOIN invocation that caused the member to\r\nbecome active. XCF preserves status information for lasting members that fail.\r\nSYSTEM CLEANUP PARTICIPANT\r\nThis line appears if SYSCLEANUPMEM=YES was specified on the IXCJOIN invocation that caused the\r\nmember to become active. XCF must wait for the member to clean up resources associated with a failed\r\nsystem before automatic resource management (ARM) can restart the batch jobs and started tasks that\r\nwere previously running on the failed system\r\nRECOVERY MANAGER\r\nThis line appears if RECOVERYMGR=YES was specified on the IXCJOIN invocation that caused the\r\nmember to become active. A member that acts as a recovery manager is responsible for coordinating\r\nsysplex-wide recovery processes.\r\nCRITICAL MEMBER\r\nThis line appears if CRITICAL=YES was specified on the IXCJOIN invocation that caused the member\r\nto become active. A critical member performs functions or provides services that are critical to the\r\noverall operation of the members group. By extension, such functions or services can be critical to the\r\noverall operation of the system. If these functions or services are impaired long enough, the member\r\nmay be terminated. Such termination can cause the system to be removed from the sysplex.\r\nLOCAL CLEANUP NOT NEEDED\r\nThis line appears if LOCALCLEANUP=CONTINUE was specified on the IXCJOIN invocation that\r\ncaused the member to become active. This indicates that the member will not need time to perform\r\nadditional cleanup when the system on which it resides is being removed from the sysplex. XCF will\r\nnot wait for the member to cleanup and will proceed to partitioning the system as soon as possible.\r\nTERMLEVEL IStermlevel\r\nThe first member-specific termination action to be taken by XCF against the member when it is\r\nnecessary to terminate the member. For any member, the indicated termination action will be applied if\r\nthe SFM policy MEMSTALLTIME specification for the system on which the member is active allows\r\nXCF to take action to alleviate a sympathy sickness condition caused by the member. For critical\r\nmembers, the indicated action can also be applied if the member appears to be impaired.termlevel is one\r\nof the following values:\r\nTASK\r\nXCF will terminate the task from which the stalled member invoked the IXCJOIN macro.\r\nJOBSTEP\r\nXCF will terminate the job step task from which the stalled member invoked the IXCJOIN macro\r\nADDRSPACE\r\nXCF will terminate the address space from which the stalled member invoked the IXCJOIN macro.\r\nSYSTEM\r\nThe system on which the stalled member resides will enter into wait state and be removed from the\r\nsysplex.\r\nMEMSTALL RESOLUTION IS memstallaction\r\nThe first member-specific action to be taken by XCF to resolve a member stall or impairment condition.\r\nFor any member, the indicated termination action will be applied if the SFM policy MEMSTALLTIME\r\nspecification for the system on which the member is active allows XCF to take action to alleviate a\r\nsympathy sickness condition caused by the member. For critical members, the indicated action can also\r\nbe applied if the member appears to be impaired. memstallactionis one of the following actions:\r\nNO ACTION\r\nXCF will not take any action to resolve the member stall or impairment condition.\r\nJOIN TASK TERMINATION AFTER memstalltimeSECONDS\r\nXCF will terminate the task from which the stalled or impaired member invoked the IXCJOIN\r\nmacro.\r\nJOB STEP TERMINATION AFTER memstalltimeSECONDS\r\nXCF will terminate the job step task from which the stalled or impaired member invoked the\r\nIXCJOIN macro.\r\nADDRESS SPACE TERMINATION AFTER memstalltimeSECONDS\r\nXCF will terminate the address space from which the stalled or impaired member invoked the\r\nIXCJOIN macro.\r\nSYSTEM TERMINATION AFTER memstalltimeSECONDS\r\nThe system on which the stalled or impaired member resides will be placed into wait state and be\r\nremoved from the sysplex.\r\nmemstalltime\r\nThe amount of time XCF will wait before taking automatic action to resolve the member stall\r\ncondition.\r\nEXITS DEFINED:exits\r\nThe user exits defined when the member invoked IXCJOIN to join its group. exits is one or more of the\r\nfollowing:\r\nNONE\r\nNo user exits were defined when the member joined the group.\r\nMESSAGE\r\nThe member has defined a message exit when it joined the group.\r\nGROUP\r\nThe member has defined a group exit when it joined the group.\r\nNOTIFY\r\nThe member has defined a notify exit when it joined the group.\r\nSTATUS\r\nThe member has defined a status exit when it joined the group.\r\nSIGNALLING SERVICE\r\nThe data that follows describes the use of the XCF Signalling Service by the member. One such line will appear\r\nfor each different signal size used by the member.\r\nmsgoaccepted\r\nCount of the number of IXCMSGO requests issued by this member that were accepted by XCF for delivery.\r\nThis number may wrap.\r\nmsgonobuffer\r\nCount of the number of IXCMSGO requests issued by this member that were rejected due to a lack of a\r\nsignal buffer. Since applications may repeatedly reissue the IXCMSGO request when rejected, this count may\r\nnot accurately portray the number of messages that were impacted by the lack of buffers. This number may\r\nwrap.\r\nmsgoxfer\r\nCount of the number of signals of the indicated size that were sent to other systems on behalf of the\r\nIXCMSGO requests issued by the member. The number of signals sent may differ from the number of\r\nIXCMSGO requests accepted because, for example, more than one signal may be sent for a particular\r\nmessage. Also the number of IXCMSGO requests accepted includes messages sent to target members that\r\nreside on the same system. If the member starts sending messages before XCF is ready to accumulate the\r\nsignal counts, they will not be included in the signal counts though they will be included in the IXCMSGO\r\nrequest count. Discrepencies can also arise because the counts are not serialized (due to performance\r\nconcerns). This number may wrap.\r\nmsgolocal\r\nCount of the number of signals of the indicated size that were sent to the local system on behalf of the\r\nIXCMSGO requests issued by the member. The number of signals sent may differ from the number of\r\nIXCMSGO requests accepted because, for example, more than one signal may be sent for a particular\r\nmessage. Also the number of IXCMSGO requests accepted includes messages sent to target members that\r\nreside on other systems. If the member starts sending messages before XCF is ready to accumulate the signal\r\ncounts, they will not be included in the signal counts though they will be included in the IXCMSGO request\r\ncount. Discrepancies can also arise because the counts are not serialized (due to performance concerns). This\r\nnumber may wrap.\r\nmsgoblen\r\nIndicates the signal buffer size used for the signals. The buffer length denotes the maximum number bytes\r\nof message data that signal buffers of this size can transfer.\r\nMESSAGE TABLE\r\nThis line indicates the number of managed messages in various states. A message sent by the IXCMSGO\r\nservice is a managed message if the TIMEOUT keyword was specified and there is some aspect of the\r\nprocessing that is still pending. A message saved by the IXCMSGC SAVEMSG service is also a managed\r\nmessage.\r\nsendpnd\r\nCount of the number of managed messages that are in a pending state because a message still needs to\r\nbe sent to one or more targets.\r\nrespnd\r\nCount of the number of managed messages that are in a pending state because an expected response\r\nhas not yet been received from one or more targets. There are no sends pending, only responses.\r\ncompltd\r\nCount of the number of managed messages that are considered complete. There are no sends pending,\r\nand if applicable no responses pending.\r\nmosaved\r\nCount of the number of managed messages currently saved by the user notify exit routine.\r\nmisaved\r\nCount of the number of managed messages currently saved by the user message exit routine. The count\r\nalso includes responses currently saved by the user notify exit routine.\r\nmsgirecv\r\nCount of the number of messages that were received on behalf of the member. This number may wrap.\r\nmsgipendq\r\nIndicates the number of work items currently pending for the member. Generally these work items are\r\nsignals containing message data to be delivered to the member. The items can also include internal work\r\nitems that XCF performs to manage message delivery on behalf of the member.\r\nmsgixfercnt\r\nCount of the number of signals received on behalf of the member from other systems. The number of signals\r\nreceived may differ from the number of messages received because, for example, more than one signal may\r\nbe sent for a particular message. Also the number of messages received includes messages sent by members\r\nthat reside on the same system. Discrepancies can also arise because the counts are not serialized (due to\r\nperformance concerns). This number may wrap.\r\nmsgixfertm\r\nThe average signal transfer time, in microseconds, for signals recently received on behalf of the member\r\nfrom some other system in the sysplex. Signal transfer is measured from the time that XCF accepts the\r\nmessage for delivery to the time that the signal(s) arrive on the target system. For messages that require\r\nmultiple signals, each signal contributes individually to the average (they are not aggregated to provide one\r\nsingle transfer time for the message as a whole). The transfer time does not include the time spent on the\r\nreceiving system after the signal arrives but before the message is presented to the signal exit routine of the\r\ntarget member.\r\nUp to 64 of the latest signals received are considered when computing the average transfer time. Signals\r\nreceived more than a minute ago are excluded from the average. For an infrequent receiver, excluding old\r\nsignals can make it appear that its transfer time is changing even though it is not receiving any new signals.\r\nN/A is displayed if no data is available (no signals recently received or the sending system does not provide\r\nthe necessary data). Average transfer times in excess of one second are displayed as 999999.\r\nMSGI PENDINGQ:\r\nShows the distribution of these queued signals across the various buffers that XCF uses for message\r\ndelivery.\r\nio buffer\r\nCount of the number of messages on the pending delivery queue that are consuming an I/O buffer.\r\nFailure to process these messages in a timely fashion could impact the ability of XCF to send and\r\nreceive other signals.\r\ndrefnnnnnn\r\nCount of the number of messages on the pending delivery queue that are consuming a DREF message\r\nbuffer.\r\npageable\r\nCount of the number of messages on the pending delivery queue that are consuming a pageable\r\nmessage buffer.\r\ncritical\r\nCount of the number of messages on the pending delivery queue that are critical.\r\n[ ! *]SYMPATHY SICK:ssbuff sscrit\r\nThe stalled member appears to be contributing to a sympathy sickness problem. If the member does not\r\nappear to be contributing to a sympathy sickness problem, SYSMPATH SICK: 0 0 is displayed.\r\n!* The line is flagged with an asterisk and an exclamation point to indicate that the stalled member\r\nappears to be contributing to a sympathy sickness problem\r\nssbuff\r\nCount of the number of I/O buffers currently consumed by the member. Use of these buffers could be\r\ncontributing to the sympathy sickness. The count will be zero if the data is not available, or if the\r\nmember does not appear to be contributing to sympathy sickness.\r\nsscrit\r\nCount of the number of stalled critical signals that are contributing to the sympathy sickness. The count\r\nwill be zero if the data is not available, or if the member does not appear to be contributing to\r\nsympathy sickness.\r\n! IMPACTED SYS: sysname sysname sysname sysname\r\nDisplays the names of the systems impacted by sympathy sickness. If the information is not available, or if\r\nthe member is not contributing to sympathy sickness, this line is not displayed.\r\n[*]EXIT\r\nThe exit routines are displayed in one the following formats:\r\nEXIT\r\nAn exit routine that is not considered stalled by XCF will not be flagged.\r\n*EXIT\r\nAn exit routine that is considered stalled by XCF will be flagged with an asterisk.

MVS will stop duplexing rebuild if the CFRM policy DUPLEX option is changed to DISABLED, if the\r\ncoupling facility in which either the old or new instance of the structure is allocated is removed from the preference\r\nlist of the structure, or if the CFRM active policy is stopped.\r\nIn the message text:\r\nstrname\r\nThe name of the structure\r\nmvsaction\r\nOne of the following:\r\nINITIATED\r\nThe duplexing rebuild was initiated by MVS for the reason indicated.\r\nSTOPPED TO FALL BACK TO THE OLD STRUCTURE\r\nThe duplexing rebuild was stopped by MVS to fall back to the old structure for the reason indicated.\r\nSTOPPED TO SWITCH TO THE NEW STRUCTURE\r\nThe duplexing rebuild was stopped by MVS to switch to the new structure for the reason indicated.\r\nreason\r\nOne of the following:\r\nCONNECTOR CONNECTED TO STRUCTURE\r\nThe duplexing rebuild was initiated by MVS in response to a user connecting to a structure.\r\nPREVIOUS REBUILD PROCESS COMPLETED\r\nThe duplexing rebuild was initiated by MVS in response to a previous rebuild process completing or a\r\nprevious rebuild stop process completing.\r\nCONNECTOR FORCED FROM STRUCTURE\r\nThe duplexing rebuild was initiated by MVS in response to a connection being forced from the structure.\r\nCONNECTOR DISCONNECTED FROM STRUCTURE\r\nThe duplexing rebuild was initiated by MVS in response to a connection disconnecting from the structure.\r\nGAINED CONNECTIVITY TO A COUPLING FACILITY\r\nThe duplexing rebuild was initiated by MVS in response to gaining connectivity to a given coupling facility.\r\nCOUPLING FACILITY ADDED TO THE PREFERENCE LIST\r\nThe duplexing rebuild was initiated by MVS in response to a change policy request that added a coupling\r\nfacility to the structure preference list.\r\nCOUPLING FACILITY DELETED FROM THE PREFERENCE LIST\r\nThe duplexing rebuild was stopped by MVS in response to a change policy request that deleted a coupling\r\nfacility from the structure preference list.\r\nCHANGE IN CFRM ACTIVE POLICY DUPLEX OPTION\r\nThe duplexing rebuild was either initiated or stopped by MVS in response to a change policy request that\r\nmodified the DUPLEX option in the CFRM active policy. A change to specify DUPLEX(ENABLED) will\r\ncause MVS to attempt to establish duplexing. A change to specify DUPLEX(DISABLED) will cause MVS to\r\nstop duplexing.\r\nCFRM ACTIVE POLICY STOPPED\r\nThe duplexing rebuild was stopped by MVS in response to the CFRM active policy being stopped.\r\nSETXCF FORCE COMMAND PROCESSING FOR STRUCTURE\r\nThe rebuild is being stopped due to a SETXCF FORCE command issued by the operator.\r\nPROGRAM INITIATED REQUEST TO FORCE STRUCTURE\r\nThe rebuild is being stopped due to a program initiated request to force the structure.\r\nALL CONNECTORS RECONCILED INTO THE POLICY\r\nThe duplexing rebuild was initiated by MVS in response to all connectors being reconciled into the active\r\npolicy.\r\nCOUPLING FACILITY GAINED CF-TO-CF LINK CONNECTIVITY\r\nThe duplexing rebuild was initiated by MVS in response to a gain in CF-to-CF link connectivity by the\r\ncoupling facility in which the structure resides.\r\nDUPLEX ENABLED MONITORING IDENTIFIED STRUCTURE\r\nThe duplexing rebuild was initiated by MVS as a result of the Duplex Enabled Monitor identifying this\r\nstructure as one which could be duplexed.\r\nSTOP DIRECTION CHANGED FOR SITE RECOVERY MANAGEMENT\r\nThe duplexing rebuild stop direction was changed by MVS in order to keep the structure in the coupling\r\nfacility at the recovery site.

Action was not taken due to the provided reason. This may mean that the environmental conditions\r\nrequired for a duplexing rebuild have not all been met, and may not necessarily require urgent action.\r\nIn the message text:\r\nstrname\r\nThe name of the structure\r\naction\r\nThe word INITIATED or STOPPED\r\nreason\r\nOne of the following:\r\nSTRUCTURE NOT DEFINED IN THE CFRM ACTIVE POLICY\r\nThe structure is not defined in the CFRM active policy and therefore is not allocated in any coupling facility.\r\nSTRUCTURE NOT ALLOCATED\r\nThe structure is not allocated in any coupling facility.\r\nAT LEAST ONE ACTIVE CONNECTION INDICATED THAT REBUILD IS NOT ALLOWED\r\nRebuild not permitted because IXLCONN with ALLOWREBLD=NO was specified by at least one active\r\nconnection.\r\nDEFERRED UNTIL PROCESS COMPLETION\r\nA duplexing rebuild could have been initiated or stopped, but the action is instead deferred. The action is\r\ndeferred to prevent duplexing rebuild processing from interfering with other potentially more important\r\nprocessing. If necessary, the system will attempt to take action once none of the following processing is in\r\nprogress: REBUILD (other than the duplex established), REALLOCATE, POPULATECF, and LOSSCONN\r\nRECOVERY. The DISPLAY,SCF,STRUCTURE,STATUS=(RBPROC,RPEND,LOSSCONN) can be used to\r\ndisplay structures associated with processing that is causing the deferral.\r\nCOUPLE DATA SET FOR CFRM NOT AVAILABLE\r\nThe couple data set for CFRM is not available to this system.\r\nNO ACTIVE CONNECTIONS TO THE STRUCTURE\r\nThe structure has no connectors to participate in rebuild.\r\nREBUILD STOP IS IN PROGRESS FOR THE STRUCTURE\r\nRebuild stop is in progress for the structure.\r\nXES FUNCTION NOT AVAILABLE\r\nXES functions are not available. This can be because the hardware necessary to provide XES functions is not\r\npresent.\r\nAN UNEXPECTED ERROR OCCURRED\r\nAn unexpected error occurred during rebuild processing.\r\nNO ELIGIBLE STRUCTURES FOUND IN COUPLING FACILITY\r\nOn a rebuild start request, no structures eligible for rebuild were found in the coupling facility specified. On\r\na rebuild stop request, no structures eligible for rebuild stop were found in the coupling facility specified.\r\nCOUPLING FACILITY NOT DEFINED IN THE CFRM ACTIVE POLICY\r\nThe coupling facility is not defined in the CFRM active policy.\r\nNO COUPLING FACILITY PROVIDED BETTER CONNECTIVITY\r\nNo other coupling facility has better connectivity than the current one. The rebuild, which was initiated due\r\nto a loss of connectivity, would cause a further degradation in connectivity if accepted. The system\r\nevaluated the set of active connections that lost connectivity to the current structure as compared with the\r\nset of active connections that would not be able to connect to the rebuild new structure. The system\r\nterminates structure rebuild processing because the result of the rebuild would cause additional active\r\nconnections to lose connectivity.\r\nNO COUPLING FACILITY PROVIDED BETTER OR EQUIVALENT CONNECTIVITY\r\nNo other coupling facility has better connectivity than the current one. The rebuild would cause a\r\ndegradation in connectivity as determined by SFM system weights, if accepted.\r\nDUPLEXING REBUILD NOT ALLOWED FOR THE STRUCTURE\r\nThe structure does not support duplexing rebuild for one of the following reasons:\r\nv DUPLEX(DISABLED) was specified or defaulted to in the CFRM active policy for the structure.\r\nv There are failed persistent connections that are unavailable until a larger CFRM couple data set is made\r\navailable.\r\nv A user-managed duplexing rebuild could not be started because:\r\n\u2013 User-managed duplexing rebuilds are not supported for the structure type.\r\n\u2013 At least one active or failed-persistent connection specified or defaulted to IXLCONN\r\nALLOWDUPREBLD=NO.\r\nv A system-managed duplexing rebuild could not be started because:\r\n\u2013 The structure has at least one active connector, and none of the connectors (active or failed-persistent)\r\nspecified IXLCONN ALLOWAUTO=YES when connecting.\r\n\u2013 A system-managed duplexing rebuild is not supported when a CFRM policy change is pending for the\r\nstructure.\r\nSTRUCTURE HAS FAILED\r\nThe request was to start a duplexing rebuild and the structure has failed. Duplexing rebuild is not allowed\r\nwhen the structure is in the failed state.\r\nNO OTHER COUPLING FACILITY FOUND IN PREFERENCE LIST\r\nSETXCF START,REBUILD was requested and LOCATION=OTHER was either specified on the rebuild\r\nrequest or defaulted to for STARTREASON=LOSSCONN or for a request to start a duplexing rebuild. In\r\naddition to avoiding the coupling facility in which the structure is currently allocated, when a duplexing\r\nrebuild is stopped by the operator and DUPLEX(ENABLED) is specified in the active policy, the subsequent\r\nduplexing request initiated due to DUPLEX(ENABLED) will avoid the coupling facility in which the\r\nprevious instance of the structure was allocated when the duplexing rebuild was stopped.\r\nSTRUCTURE DOES NOT SUPPORT SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESSES\r\nThe structure does not support system-managed processes (for example, rebuild) for one of the following\r\nreasons:\r\nv The structure was not allocated in a coupling facility at or above the minimum CFLEVEL required for the\r\ncurrent process by a system supporting system-managed processing.\r\nv The structure has connections that have not been reconciled into the CFRM active policy.\r\nv Structure cleanup is in progress for the structure.\r\nCONNECTORS DO NOT SUPPORT SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESSES\r\nThe requested system-managed process cannot be initiated for one of the following reasons:\r\nv The structure has at least one active connector and at least one of the connectors (active or\r\nfailed-persistent) did not specify IXLCONN ALLOWAUTO=YES when connecting.\r\nv A duplexing rebuild cannot be initiated for a structure that has only failed-persistent connectors, and at\r\nleast one of the failed-persistent connectors did not specify IXLCONN ALLOWAUTO=YES when\r\nconnecting.\r\nNO SUITABLE COUPLING FACILITY IN PREFERENCE LIST\r\nThe requested system-managed process cannot be initiated for one or more of the following reasons:\r\nv The preference list is empty.\r\nv The preference list contains no other coupling facility at or above the minimum CFLEVEL required for the\r\ncurrent process.\r\nv A potentially suitable coupling facility does not permit structure allocation.\r\nAT LEAST ONE CONNECTOR HAS LOST CONNECTIVITY TO THE STRUCTURE\r\nThe requested system-managed process (for example, rebuild) cannot be initiated because one or more of the\r\nconnectors to the target structure has lost connectivity.\r\nCFRM COUPLE DATA SET DOES NOT SUPPORT SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESS\r\nThe CFRM couple data set does not support the requested system-managed process (for example, rebuild),\r\nbecause the CFRM couple data set was not formatted at or above the minimum version for the\r\nsystem-managed process requested. Use the DISPLAY XCF,COUPLE,TYPE=CFRM command to determine\r\nthe format of the CFRM couple data set. To support system-managed rebuild the CFRM couple data set\r\nshould be formatted specifying \u201cITEM NAME(SMREBLD) NUMBER(1)\u201d. For system-managed duplexing\r\nrebuild, \u201cITEM NAME(SMDUPLEX) NUMBER(1)\u201d should also be specified when formatting a CFRM couple\r\ndata set. Specifying \u201cITEM NAME(SMDUPLEX) NUMBER(1)\u201d implicitly formats a CFRM couple data set\r\nthat supports both system-managed rebuild and system-managed duplexing rebuild.\r\nSTRUCTURE WITH NO CONNECTORS HAS NEVER BEEN SYSTEM-MANAGED DUPLEXED\r\nA system-managed duplexing rebuild cannot be initiated because there are no connections to the structure\r\nand the structure has not previously been duplexed using system-managed processing.\r\nALLOCATION OF REBUILD NEW STRUCTURE FOR DUPLEXING REBUILD NOT FEASIBLE\r\nAllocation of the rebuild new structure instance in support of a duplexing rebuild is not feasible.

The unconditional stop path request\r\nwas initiated by either the operator or the system. All processing for the rebuild request is ended.\r\nUNEXPECTED ERROR\r\nAn unexpected failure occurred while processing the command.\r\nNO CONNECTIVITY TO COUPLING FACILITY\r\nThe system processing the rebuild command does not have connectivity to the coupling facility containing the\r\nrebuilt structure. This situation could be due to operator commands such as VARY PATH OFFLINE or CONFIG\r\nCHP OFFLINE or hardware errors such as facility or path failures.\r\nNO CONNECTION AVAILABLE FOR XCF\r\nXCF was unable to connect to the structure. There was no connection available for XCF to use. Possible\r\nexplanations include:\r\nv The maximum number of connectors to a structure has been reached for the CFRM active policy.\r\nv The model dependent limit on the maximum number of connectors to a list structure has been reached for the\r\ncoupling facility that contains the list structure.\r\nv Some non-XCF connector is connected to the structure. A non-XCF connector can prevent XCF from\r\nconnecting to a structure even though all the connections are not in use.\r\nUNEXPECTED HARDWARE ERROR\r\nThe signalling path could not be rebuilt due to an unexpected hardware error.\r\nSTRUCTURE NOT DEFINED IN ACTIVE POLICY\r\nThe indicated structure name is not defined in the CFRM active policy. The structure must be defined in the\r\nactive policy in order to connect to the structure.\r\nUNABLE TO ALLOCATE STRUCTURE\r\nStructure could not be allocated. Message IXC463I is written to the system log to explain why the allocation\r\nfailed in each of the coupling facilities that was tried. The preference list in the CFRM active policy determines\r\nwhich coupling facilities are allowed to contain the structure.\r\nNEW CONNECTIONS TO STRUCTURE BEING PREVENTED\r\nNew connections to the requested structure are being prevented at this time for one of the following reasons:\r\nv All active connectors have confirmed the rebuild quiesce event. New connections will not be permitted until\r\nthe rebuild or rebuild stop is completed.\r\nv The structure is allocated in a coupling facility that is failed. New connections will not be permitted until the\r\nstructure is rebuilt, or all connections disconnect causing the structure to be deallocated.\r\nv The coupling facility containing the structure is not available for use because policy reconciliation is in\r\nprogress. New connections will not be permitted until policy reconciliation is complete.\r\nv New structure allocations for this structure name are not permitted because there is a pending policy change\r\nfor this structure. New connections will not be permitted until the change is complete.\r\nUNABLE TO DEFINE LOCAL LIST NOTIFICATION VECTOR\r\nThe list notification vector used to monitor list transitions could not be defined. The situation is most likely\r\ncaused by a lack of storage in the Hardware System Area (HSA).\r\nOTHER SYSTEMS USING STRUCTURE INCOMPATIBLY\r\nSome other system is using the structure in ways that are not compatible with the protocols used by the system\r\nthat processed the rebuild request.\r\nDELAYED UNTIL STOP COMPLETES\r\nA system initiated rebuild request is delayed until stop path processing completes. The system will automatically\r\nstart the path upon successful completion of the stop, provided the path remains defined to XCF for signalling.\r\nSTRUCTURE FAILURE\r\nThe structure failed.\r\nCOUPLE DATA SET FOR CFRM NOT AVAILABLE\r\nThe couple data set for CFRM is not available to this system. In order to connect to structures, the couple data\r\nset for CFRM must be available.\r\nFor a system that is IPLing into an existing sysplex, this failure also arises when the indicated structure is not\r\ndefined in the CFRM active policy.\r\nDELAYED UNTIL STRUCTURE DUMP COMPLETES\r\nThe connect to the structure could not complete because SVC Dump holds serialization on the structure.\r\nSTRUCTURE'S DISPOSITION IS KEEP\r\nThe rebuilt structure was created with a disposition that allows it to persist (remain allocated) when there are no\r\ndefined connections. Since the system that processed the rebuild request does not use persistent structures, the\r\nstructure is being used in ways that are not compatible with its protocols.\r\nSTRUCTURE'S LIST ENTRY SIZE TOO SMALL\r\nThe rebuilt structure was created with a maximum size list entry that is not large enough to contain 65536 bytes\r\nof data. Since the system that processed the rebuild command creates list entries containing up to 65536 bytes of\r\ndata, the structure is being used in ways that are not compatible with its protocols.\r\nSTRUCTURE DOES NOT USE ADJUNCT DATA\r\nThe rebuilt structure does not use adjunct data. Since the system that processed the rebuild request uses adjunct\r\ndata for its list entries, the structure is being used in ways that are not compatible with its protocols.\r\nXES FUNCTION NOT AVAILABLE\r\nXES functions are not available. This situation can arise when the hardware necessary to provide XES functions\r\nis not present.\r\nSTRUCTURE IN USE BY A NON-XCF CONNECTOR\r\nOne or more of the connectors to the rebuilt structure is not XCF. Since it appears that the structure is in use by\r\nsome other application, XCF disconnects from the structure to avoid interfering with that application. Structures\r\nto be used by XCF for signalling should be dedicated exclusively to XCF in order to ensure correct operation.\r\nMessage IXC452I is issued to identify the non-XCF connectors.\r\nSTRUCTURE IN USE BY ANOTHER SYSPLEX\r\nThe rebuilt structure appears to be in use by systems in a different sysplex. Signalling paths are only permitted\r\nbetween systems participating in the same sysplex.\r\nTOO FEW LISTS IN STRUCTURE\r\nThe structure does not have enough lists available.\r\nThe rebuilt structure was not allocated with the minimum number of lists required for XCF to make use of the\r\nstructure for signalling. It could be that the structure was allocated by a non-XCF connector, or that there was\r\nnot enough space available to allocate the structure with the desired number of lists.\r\nNOT ENOUGH FREE SPACE IN STRUCTURE FOR SIGNALLING\r\nThere is not enough space available in the rebuilt structure for XCF to use it for signalling. After connecting to\r\nthe structure, XCF verifies that there is enough space available to manage the structure and to be able to send at\r\nleast one signal of the maximum supported message length. If the size of the structure is greater than or equal to\r\nthe maximum structure size defined in the CFRM active policy, the size specified in the policy must be increased\r\nso that a larger structure can be allocated. If the allocated structure size is less than the size defined in the policy\r\nfor the structure, the coupling facility containing the structure did not have enough space available to allocate\r\nthe structure as large as the policy allowed. Either more space needs to be made available in the coupling facility,\r\nor the structure needs to be allocated in a coupling facility that can accommodate it.\r\nUNEXPECTED ERROR\r\nAn unexpected failure occurred while processing the command.\r\nIXLREBLD REQUEST(START) FAILED\r\nXCF attempted to initiate a structure rebuild by invoking the IXLREBLD macro but the START rebuild request\r\nfailed.\r\nREBUILD WAS STOPPED AND ORIGINAL UNUSABLE\r\nRebuild processing was stopped, so the rebuilt structure will not be used. The original structure is not usable by\r\nthis system, so the system will stop using the original structure.\r\nREBUILT NOT USABLE, NEED ORIGINAL FOR SIGNAL CONNECTIVITY\r\nThis system is not able to use the rebuilt structure, so it considered disconnecting from the structure so that other\r\nsystems could proceed with using the rebuilt structure. Since disconnecting from the original structure would\r\nlead to a loss of signalling connectivity, the rebuild is stopped.\r\nSTOP REBUILD, WOULD LOSE SIGNAL CONNECTIVITY\r\nThe rebuild is stopped since this system would lose signalling connectivity with one or more systems if it were\r\nto use the rebuilt structure.\r\nREBUILT NOT USABLE, ORIGINAL NOT USABLE\r\nNeither the original structure nor the rebuilt structure can be used by this system.\r\nSTOP REBUILD, WOULD LOSE SPACE\r\nA rebuild was requested in order to increase the amount of usable space in the structure. The rebuild is stopped\r\nsince the rebuilt structure did not resolve the space problem.\r\nSTOP REBUILD, WOULD LOSE LISTS\r\nA rebuild was requested in order to increase the number of lists in the structure. The rebuild is stopped since the\r\nrebuilt structure did not resolve the problem with the number of lists.\r\nREBUILT NOT USABLE\r\nThis system cannot use the rebuilt structure.\r\n DIAG073=nnnnn\r\nDiagnostic data that is provided to assist IBM service personnel with problem determination.\r\nSystem action: If possible, the system reverts to using the original structure. If the original structure is not usable,\r\nthe system initiates stop path processing.\r\nOperator response: If stop path processing was performed for the structure, enter a SETXCF START path command\r\nto try to start the structure again.\r\nIf the system reverts to using the original structure, resolve any hardware, definitional, or capacity problems. Then\r\nenter a SETXCF START,REBUILD command to try rebuilding the structure again.\r\nIf the problem persists, do the following:\r\n1. Record the name of the signalling path, the text explaining why the rebuild was not successful, and any\r\ndiagnostic data presented with this message. The system programmer will need this information if it becomes\r\nnecessary to contact IBM service for problem resolution.\r\n2. Enter the display commands that are relevant to the problem. Record the results of the display commands to\r\nassist with problem determination.\r\n3. Contact hardware support as needed.\r\n4. Contact the system programmer as needed.\r\nThe following commands are useful for investigating unsuccessful rebuild requests for structures. In some cases, it\r\nmay be helpful to enter these commands on systems in the sysplex other than the one that was processing the\r\nrebuild request.\r\nv DISPLAY XCF,PATHOUT,STRNAME=strname to display detailed information about the use of the structure for\r\nsignalling, including the state of the outbound list paths that have been started.\r\nv DISPLAY XCF,PATHIN,STRNAME=strname to display detailed information about the use of the structure for\r\nsignalling, including the state of the inbound list paths that have been started.\r\nv DISPLAY XCF,STRUCTURE to display summary information about the structures defined in this sysplex.\r\nv DISPLAY XCF,STRUCTURE,STRNAME=strname to display detailed information about the indicated structure.\r\nv DISPLAY XCF,CF to display summary information about the coupling facilities defined in this sysplex.\r\nv DISPLAY XCF,CF,CFNAME=cfname to display detailed information about the indicated coupling facility as defined\r\nto the sysplex.\r\nv DISPLAY CF to display summary hardware information about the coupling facilities connected to a system.\r\nv DISPLAY CF,CFNAME= cfname to display detailed hardware information about the indicated coupling facility\r\nconnected to a system.\r\nv DISPLAY M=CHP(chp) to display the state of the channel paths connecting a system to a coupling facility.\r\nDepending on the message text, do the following manual intervention:\r\nNO CONNECTIVITY TO COUPLING FACILITY\r\nEnter a DISPLAY XCF,STRUCTURE,STRNAME= strname for information about which coupling facility contains\r\nthe indicated structure. Enter a DISPLAY CF,CFNAME=cfname command to display the status of that coupling\r\nfacility and the channel paths that connect the system to it, ( cfname is the name of the coupling facility that\r\ncontains the structure).\r\nEnter a CONFIG CHP command to configure channel paths to the coupling facility, if needed. Enter a VARY\r\nPATH command to vary the channel paths online to the system, if needed.\r\nNO CONNECTION AVAILABLE FOR XCF\r\nEnter a DISPLAY XCF,STRUCTURE,STRNAME= strname command for information about the connectors to the\r\nstructure. Enter a DISPLAY XCF,POLICY,TYPE=CFRM command for information about the CFRM active policy.\r\nConsult the system programmer as needed to determine whether to:\r\nv Perform the steps needed to activate a CFRM policy that has been formatted to support more connectors.\r\nv Enter a SETXCF START,REBUILD command to rebuild the structure in a coupling facility that supports more\r\nconnectors.\r\nv Perform the steps needed to cause the non-XCF connector to disconnect from the structure.\r\nUNABLE TO DEFINE LOCAL LIST NOTIFICATION VECTOR\r\nEnter a DISPLAY XCF,STR command to determine which structures are in use. For each structure that is in use,\r\nenter a DISPLAY,XCF,STR,STRNAME=inusestr , where inusestr is the name of an in use structure, to determine\r\nwhich applications are connected to the structure from this system. Consult the system programmer as needed to\r\ndetermine whether to reduce the number of connectors connected to structures from the system that processed\r\nthe rebuild command, or to modify the way in which the connectors are using the structure, or to perform the\r\nsteps needed to increase the amount of storage in the Hardware System Area (HSA).\r\nDELAYED UNTIL STRUCTURE DUMP COMPLETES\r\nIf the dump does not complete within a reasonable time, enter a DISPLAY,XCF,STRNAME= strname command for\r\ninformation about the structure dump. To force the dump serialization to be released, enter a SETXCF\r\nFORCE,STRDUMPSERIAL command. Note however, that the requested structure dump may then fail to contain\r\nthe data needed for problem determination.\r\nSystem programmer response: Do the following:\r\n1. Examine the information provided by the operator.\r\n2. Ensure that the hardware is correctly configured, defined to the system, and operational.\r\n3. Perform the actions suggested below for the indicated message text.\r\n4. Examine logrec error records for I/O errors or other hardware problems related to the signalling path.\r\n5. Examine the system log for other messages related to the signalling path. Messages IXC452I, IXC457I, and IXC463I are especially relevant.\r\n6. Obtain the following additional diagnostic information as appropriate for problem determination:\r\nv The XCF component trace table. The trace table must be obtained within 30 seconds of the problem if XCF\r\ndetail tracing is enabled, and within a few minutes if just XCF default tracing is in effect. Default tracing is\r\nsufficient to resolve this problem.\r\nv XES component trace tables. Obtain both the global trace buffer and the connection related trace buffer.\r\nIf the problem persists, search problem reporting data bases for a fix for the problem. If no fix exists, contact the IBM\r\nSupport Center. Supply any diagnostic data presented as part of the rebuild failed message, any output from the\r\nDISPLAY commands issued while investigating the problem, the system log(s), and any of the traces that were\r\nobtained.\r\nDepending on the message text, the following actions are appropriate:\r\nNO CONNECTION AVAILABLE FOR XCF\r\nIf the maximum number of connectors to a structure has been reached for the CFRM active policy, use the XCF\r\ncouple data set format utility to create a new couple data set that supports more connectors. Run the XCF\r\nAdministrative Data Utility to recreate the CFRM policy in the new couple data set. Have the operator make this\r\ncouple data set available to the sysplex.\r\nIf the model dependent limit on the maximum number of connectors to a list structure has been reached for the\r\ncoupling facility that contains the list structure, have the operator rebuild the structure into some other coupling\r\nfacility that can support the required number of connectors. If so, consider modifying the preference list in the\r\nCFRM policy so that the structure is allocated in coupling facilities that can support the required number of\r\nconnectors. If no suitable coupling facility is available, consider defining more list structures for signalling so that\r\neach list structures provides signalling connectivity for a subset of systems in the sysplex. The structures together\r\ncan provide for full signalling connectivity but the number of connectors need not exceed the model dependent\r\nlimits on the number of connectors.\r\nIf some non-XCF connector is connected to the structure, take whatever steps are needed to force that connector\r\nto disconnect.\r\nUNABLE TO DEFINE LOCAL LIST NOTIFICATION VECTOR\r\nThere was not enough storage available in the Hardware System Area (HSA) of the system that processed the\r\nstart command to allow a list notification vector to be defined. Either reduce the amount of storage being used in\r\nthe HSA, or increase the amount of storage available in the HSA for creating list notification vectors. Reduce the\r\namount of HSA storage being used by decreasing the number of connectors or changing the way connectors\r\nmake use of their structure. For example, the size of the list notification vector required by the XCF signalling\r\nservice is determined by the number of inbound list paths to be started. As another example, changing the\r\nnumber of buffers associated with a XES cache structure changes the amount of HSA storage required by the\r\nconnector.\r\nCOUPLE DATA SET FOR CFRM NOT AVAILABLE\r\nUse the XCF format utility program to format a couple data set for CFRM. Ensure that the couple data set\r\nformatted for CFRM is available to the system.\r\nNOT ENOUGH FREE SPACE IN STRUCTURE FOR SIGNALLING\r\nIf the size of the structure is greater than or equal to the maximum structure size defined in the CFRM active\r\npolicy, use the XCF Administrative Data Utility to increase the structure size specified in a policy. Have the\r\noperator activate the updated policy.\r\nIf the allocated structure size is less than the size defined in the policy for the structure, the coupling facility\r\ncontaining the structure did not have enough space available to allocate the structure as large as the policy\r\nallowed. Either more space needs to be made available in the coupling facility, or the structure needs to be\r\nallocated in a coupling facility that can accommodate it. More space can be made available in a coupling facility\r\nby causing structures to be deallocated from that facility, or by decreasing the amount of space reserved for\r\nstructure dumps. It may be necessary to modify the preference list or the exclusion list defined in the CFRM\r\npolicy to allow the structure to be allocated in a more suitable coupling facility. Alternatively, it may be necessary\r\nto make a new coupling facility available for the sysplex to use.\r\nUNABLE TO ALLOCATE STRUCTURE\r\nExamine the system log for instances of message IXC463I for explanations of why the structure could not be\r\nallocated. Message IXC463I is issued for each coupling facility that was considered. Resolve the problems\r\nindicated by message IXC463I or make a suitable coupling facility available for use.\r\nSource: Cross System Coupling Facility (SCXCF)\r\nModule: IXCT1NSS, IXCT1PCC\r\nRouting code: 1, 2\r\nDescriptor code: 5,12", "IXC431I": " text\r\nExplanation: In the message, text is:\r\nGROUP gnmeMEMBERmnmeJOB jnmeASIDasid\r\nSTALLED ATsdate stime ID: s#.r#\r\nLAST MSGX:adate sitime siexit STALLED swork PENDINGQ\r\nLAST GRPX:gdate gtme gnexit STALLED gwork PENDINGQ\r\nLAST STAX:stdate sttime stexit STALLED\r\nThe indicated XCF Group Member is not processing its XCF work in a timely manner. The processing of at least one\r\nwork item appears to be stalled.\r\nNote: It is very unlikely that the delays are caused by a problem in XCF.\r\nPossible explanations include:\r\nv Contention problems in the user exit routine(s). Perhaps the exit routine is suspended waiting to obtain the local\r\nlock or a latch. DISPLAY GRS,C will identify latch contention.\r\nv SRBs not dispatched in a timely manner. Perhaps the member address space is swapped out or a dump is in\r\nprogress. Perhaps the dispatch priority of the member address space is too low. Perhaps a loop in some other work\r\nunit is consuming most of the CPU resource. The looping work unit need not be in the member address space. It\r\ncould be in an address space other than those identified by the IXC431I message(s).\r\nv An influx of work has exceeded the processing capacity of the member or system. The influx may be a temporary\r\nspike that the system can work through with time.

Although XCF may\r\nhave identified the indicated member as stalled, the situation could be the result of sympathy sickness arising from\r\nprocessing delays elsewhere in the sysplex (which may or may not have been identified).\r\nv A member or system might be engaged in reconfiguration or recovery processes that must complete before normal\r\nprocessing can proceed. For example, a system may have just become active in the sysplex, a system may have just\r\nbeen removed from the sysplex, a member may be joining the group, a member may be leaving the group, or\r\nsome other application specific processes may be running.\r\nv The user exit routine may have a coding error in which it returns to the dispatcher instead of returning to XCF.\r\nOne would expect this situation to occur only when testing a new application that exploits XCF services.\r\nIt may not be possible to determine the impact to the application without understanding the nature and content of\r\nthe item(s) experiencing the delay. The impact may not be limited to the stalled member if it provides services to\r\nother applications or subsystems in the sysplex.

If the stalled condition persists, but other items are being\r\nsuccessfully processed, XCF periodically reissues message IXC431I with updated information. XCF may issue abend\r\nX'00C' reason X'020F0006' to initiate internal XCF self verification and other actions to address the situation.

If through\r\ncustomer action, the message is rerouted to an operator console, the operator should monitor the situation. If there\r\ndoes not seem to be any detrimental impact, no further action may be needed.

At the direction of the system\r\nprogrammer, you may need to obtain dumps for problem diagnosis and/or terminate the indicated application.\r\nXCF monitors its own internal use of the XCF signalling service and may issue message IXC431I if XCF itself appears\r\nto be stalled. However, the DISPLAY XCF,GROUP command cannot be used to investigate such stalls since the\r\ncommand does not support the internal XCF group.\r\nSystem programmer response: Check the status of the stalled application/subsystem. If multiple members appear\r\nto be stalled, or if other indicators suggest work is not being processed, there may be an underlying problem\r\naffecting them all. If so, a broader system diagnosis my be warranted because the impacted members may not be at\r\nfault. On many occasions the system will successfully resolve the situation during the course of normal processing, in\r\nwhich case no further action is warranted. If necessary, take appropriate action to correct the situation or\r\ncancel/terminate the application. Before terminating the application, issue DISPLAY XCF,GROUP,grpname ,ALL and\r\nany relevant application display, then collect the following diagnostic information: system log, application log, and an\r\nappropriate dump. In addition to application specific diagnostic data, the dump should include XCF data\r\n(SDATA=COUPLE).

The type of process is either rebuild or duplexing rebuild and\r\nthe method is user-managed.\r\nSYSTEM-MANAGED REBUILD\r\nA system-managed rebuild is being stopped.\r\nPENDING REBUILD\r\nA pending rebuild from a POPULATECF rebuild request is being stopped.\r\nSYSTEM-MANAGED DUPLEXING REBUILD\r\nA system-managed duplexing rebuild is being stopped.\r\nstrname\r\nName of the structure for which information is recorded.\r\naction\r\nThe action that is taken when the rebuild process is stopped. action is one of the following:\r\nTO FALL BACK TO THE OLD STRUCTURE\r\nThe rebuild process is stopping to fall back to the old structure.\r\nTO SWITCH TO THE NEW STRUCTURE\r\nThe rebuild process is stopping to switch to the new structure.\r\nblank\r\nThe rebuild process is stopping because the target structure is being deallocated, due to disconnect of the\r\nlast connector.\r\nreason\r\nOne of the following:\r\nLOSS OF CONNECTIVITY TO THE OLD STRUCTURE\r\nThe reason specified for stopping the rebuild process was lost connectivity to the coupling facility where the\r\nold structure was located.\r\nLOSS OF CONNECTIVITY TO THE NEW STRUCTURE\r\nThe reason specified for stopping the rebuild process was lost connectivity to the coupling facility where the\r\nnew structure was located.\r\nFAILURE OF THE OLD STRUCTURE\r\nThe reason specified for stopping the rebuild process was structure failure of the old structure.\r\nFAILURE OF THE NEW STRUCTURE\r\nThe reason specified for stopping the rebuild process was structure failure of the new structure.\r\nCONNECTOR SPECIFIC REASON\r\nThe reason specified for stopping the rebuild process was provided by the issuer of IXLREBLD. IXLREBLD\r\nis the programming interface for structure rebuild processing.\r\nREQUEST FROM AN OPERATOR\r\nThe reason specified for stopping the rebuild process was the operator issuing the SETXCF STOP,REBUILD\r\ncommand.\r\nNO COUPLING FACILITY PROVIDING BETTER CONNECTIVITY\r\nNo other facility has better connectivity than the current one. The rebuild, which was initiated because of a\r\nloss of connectivity, would cause a further degradation in connectivity if accepted. The system evaluated the\r\nset of active connections that lost connectivity to the current structure as compared with the set of active\r\nconnections that would not be able to connect to the rebuild new structure. The system terminates structure\r\nrebuild processing because the result of the rebuild would cause additional active connections to lose\r\nconnectivity.\r\nNO COUPLING FACILITY PROVIDING BETTER OR EQUIVALENT CONNECTIVITY\r\nNo other facility has better connectivity than the current one. The rebuild would cause a degradation in\r\nconnectivity as determined by SFM system weights, if accepted.\r\nNote: When this reason is received for an operator-initiated rebuild by STRNAME or CFNAME and the\r\ninstallation needs to rebuild the structures, a SETXCF START,REBUILD command specifying\r\nLESSCONN=CONTINUE can be used to force the rebuild to continue despite this condition. Because this\r\nmight cause active connections to the structure to lose connectivity to the structure, do not use\r\nLESSCONN=CONTINUE unless you understand the impact to the application or subsystem. Consult the\r\napplication or subsystem documentation for recommendations.\r\nTHE SPECIFIED POPULATECF IS LESS SUITABLE\r\nThe specified PopulateCF is less suitable than the coupling facility where the structure is currently allocated.\r\nA CHANGE IN THE CFRM ACTIVE POLICY FOR THE STRUCTURE\r\nThe reason specified for stopping the rebuild process was a change in either the CFRM active policy\r\nDUPLEX specification for the structure or a change in the structure preference list such that the facility in\r\nwhich either the old or new structure is allocated is no longer in the preference list. When the CFRM active\r\npolicy DUPLEX specification for a structure is changed to DUPLEX(DISABLED) for a change policy request,\r\nduplexing rebuild is stopped by MVS when the change is processed. Duplexing rebuild is also stopped\r\nwhen the facility in which the old or new structure is allocated is removed from the preference list.\r\nLOSS OF CONNECTIVITY TO THE STRUCTURE\r\nThe reason specified for stopping the rebuild process was lost connectivity to either the coupling facility\r\nwhere the old structure was allocated or the coupling facility where the new structure was allocated.\r\nFAILURE OF THE STRUCTURE\r\nThe reason specified for stopping the rebuild process was structure failure of either the new or the old\r\nstructure.\r\nINSUFFICIENT CONNECTIVITY DUE TO CHANGE IN THE SET OF CONNECTORS\r\nThe reason specified for stopping the rebuild process was insufficient connectivity due to a change in the set\r\nof connectors.\r\nFAILURE OF A SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESS PHASE\r\nA phase of a system-managed process was unsuccessful. Message IXC573I may have been issued to provide\r\nadditional information.\r\nCONNECTOR DISCONNECTED FROM STRUCTURE\r\nThe rebuild was stopped in response to a connection disconnecting from the structure. A user-managed\r\nrebuild cannot continue after the last connector disconnects, even if the structure persists.\r\nDEALLOCATION OF THE STRUCTURE\r\nThe rebuild was stopped because the structure was deallocated (for example, the last connector disconnected\r\nfrom a non-persistent structure).\r\nDUMP SERIALIZATION HELD ON STRUCTURE\r\nThe rebuild was stopped because dump serialization prevented access to either the old or the new structure\r\ninstance.\r\nUNEXPECTED ERROR\r\nThe rebuild was stopped due to an unexpected error condition.\r\nFAILURE OF A DUPLEXED REQUEST\r\nThe system-managed duplexing rebuild was stopped due to the failure of a duplexed request.\r\nINABILITY TO PRESERVE DUPLEXING\r\nThe system-managed duplexing rebuild was stopped to allow the first connection to the structure after a\r\ntotal loss of connectivity to a coupling facility containing an instance of the duplexed pair or after a sysplex\r\nfailure. To preserve duplexing, both instances of the duplexed pair must be accessible to the system where\r\nthe first connection to the structure is running.\r\nDETECTION OF A DUPLEX OUT OF SYNCH CONDITION\r\nThe system-managed duplexing rebuild was stopped due to the detection of an out of synch condition. The\r\ncondition is detected by a duplexed request issued during the duplex established phase of a\r\nsystem-managed duplexing rebuild. Both structure instances are no longer usable and are failed by the\r\nsystem.\r\nCONNECTOR HANG\r\nThe rebuild was stopped in an attempt to relieve a connector hang during the processing of a rebuild-related\r\nevent. The system has issued message IXL040E or IXL041E to report the failure of the connector to provide\r\nan expected response to the event. The SFM policy specifies a value of CFSTRHANGTIME that permits the\r\nsystem to take automatic action to relieve connector hangs.\r\nSTRUCTURE INSTANCE DID NOT HAVE ANY AVAILABLE CONIDS\r\nThe duplexing rebuild was stopped because a structure instance did not have any available connection\r\nidentifiers.\r\nCONNECTOR DID NOT ALLOW USER LIMIT CHANGES\r\nThe duplexing rebuild was stopped because a connector connected and did not specify MAXCONN on the\r\nIXLCONN invocation.\r\nSTRUCTURE OBJECTS IN STORAGE-CLASS MEMORY\r\nThe duplexing rebuild was stopped because of usage of storage-class memory.\r\nSTRUCTURE FULL\r\nThe rebuild was stopped because the new structure instance is full. This may happen when copying\r\nstructure objects to the new structure instance requires SCM-related resources that cannot be allocated.\r\nRebuild the structure after updating the structure sizing in the CFRM policy to accommodate more structure\r\nobjects.\r\ncodetype\r\nOne of the following:\r\nUSER CODE:\r\nThe stop code was specified by a user.\r\nSYSTEM CODE:\r\nThe stop code was specified by the system.\r\nstopcode\r\nWhen the rebuild is stopped due to CONNECTOR SPECIFIC REASON, this is the USERCODE specified by the\r\nissuer of the IXLREBLD STOP request. Consult the documentation for the application that initiated the the\r\nrebuild for the meaning of this value.\r\nWhen the rebuild was stopped due to FAILURE OF A SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESS PHASE, FAILURE OF A\r\nDUPLEXED REQUEST, DETECTION OF A DUPLEX OUT OF SYNC CONDITION, or CONNECTOR HANG,\r\nthis is an internal value indicating the reason for the rebuild stop, and is diagnostic data provided to help IBM\r\nservice personnel with problem determination.\r\nSystem action: The system stops the rebuild process for the structure as indicated. Depending on the reason for\r\nstopping the rebuild process, other actions may be initiated when the stop of the current rebuild process completes.\r\nFor example, if the structure is to be duplexed as indicated by a CFRM policy DUPLEX(ENABLED) specification, the\r\nsystem may initiate a duplexing rebuild when the current rebuild process is stopped.\r\nOperator response: If the rebuild process was stopped due to a problem in allocating or connecting to the rebuild\r\nnew structure, gather the information that the system programmer will need to determine the cause of the problem\r\nand correct it. In particular, messages (such as IXL013I, IXL015I, IXC573I, or IXC574I) may have been issued to the\r\nhardcopy log to document any rebuild connection failures or rebuild new structure allocation failures which may\r\nhave occurred, and caused the rebuild process to be stopped.

The SYSTEM CODEis an internal value indicating the reason for the stop, and is diagnostic data provided to help IBM personnel with\r\nproblem determination.\r\nCONNECTOR HANG\r\nThe system is stopping the rebuild to try to alleviate a hang of a structure-related process caused by\r\nfailure of a connector to provide an expected response.\r\nNO AVAILABLE CONIDS\r\nThe system is stopping the duplexing rebuild because a structure instance did not have any\r\navailable connection identifiers.\r\nUSER DID NOT ALLOW USER LIMIT CHANGES\r\nThe system is stopping the duplexing rebuild because the structure instances had different facility\r\nuser-id limits, and a connector did not specify MAXCONN on the IXLCONN invocation.\r\nPOLICY CHANGE PENDING \u2014 CHANGE\r\nThere is an administrative policy change pending for this structure. The pending change is to change the\r\npolicy definition for the structure. Each policy item that has a different value in the pending policy\r\ncompared to the active policy will be highlighted in the PENDING POLICY INFORMATION section of the\r\ndisplay. Note that there is a period of time during a structure rebuild process where the pending policy\r\ninformation has already been copied over into the active policy, and yet the structure is still marked as\r\npolicy change pending. In such cases, the PENDING POLICY INFORMATION section of the display will not\r\nbe provided, since no policy items differ between the active and pending policies at that time.\r\nPOLICY CHANGE PENDING - DELETE\r\nThere is an administrative policy change pending. The pending policy change is to delete the policy\r\ndefinition for the structure.\r\nSTRUCTURE NOT DEFINED IN POLICY\r\nThe structure is not defined in the active policy and therefore cannot be connected to. This scenario can only\r\noccur when all instances of the structure are either deallocation pending or in transition.\r\nFAILED-PERSISTENT CONNECTIONS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO LARGER CFRM COUPLE DATA SET REQUIRED\r\nThe CFRM Couple Data Set must be reformatted to correct this unavailability.\r\n{ALTER IN PROGRESS | ALTER STOP IN PROGRESS}\r\nStructure alter has been initiated and is in progress or stopping. The message text indicates how the alter\r\nwas initiated:\r\nstartsrc [ALTER, STOP REQUESTED stopsrc]\r\nstartsrc One of the following:\r\nOPERATOR INITIATED\r\nThe operator has initiated structure alter via a SETXCF START,ALTER command.\r\nPROGRAM INITIATED\r\nA program initiated structure alter via an IXLALTER REQUEST=START invocation.\r\nSYSTEM INITIATED\r\nThe system initiated structure alter. A system-initiated alter (automatic alter) for an eligible\r\nstructure will begin when structure full monitoring determines that a structure contains\r\nmonitored objects that are at or above the structure full threshold specified in the policy by\r\nFULLTHRESHOLD.

One of the following:\r\nv K (kilobytes)\r\nv M (megabytes)\r\nv G (gigabytes)\r\nv T (terabytes)\r\nNote: In the message output, the size unit displayed may be converted to the largest size unit that can\r\nbe used to represent the size and avoids any rounding.\r\nTARGET RATIO: targetratio\r\nThe target ratio in form entry:element when the entry-to-element ratio is changing. The ratio was\r\nspecified by a program or by the system.\r\nTARGET EMC STORAGE PERCENT: targetEMCpct\r\nThe EMC storage target as a percentage of total structure storage when the EMC storage percent is\r\nchanging. The percentage was specified by a program or by the system.\r\nPOPULATECF REBUILD PENDING FOR cfname\r\nThe structure is pending rebuild for the current PopulateCF rebuild. cfname is the name of the coupling\r\nfacility specified for the PopulateCF rebuild request.\r\nPOPULATECF REBUILD IN PROGRESS FOR cfname\r\nThe structure is being rebuilt for the current PopulateCF rebuild.cfname is the name of the coupling facility\r\nspecified for the PopulateCF rebuild request.\r\nSTRUCTURE CLEANUP IN PROGRESS\r\nA lock structure is being cleared of residual information.\r\nREALLOCATE EVALUATION PENDING\r\nThe allocated structure is pending evaluation of its current location. The REALLOCATE process initiated by\r\nthe SETXCF START,REALLOCATE operator command examines each allocated structure to determine\r\nwhether the location of any of the instance(s) needs to be adjusted and/or a pending policy activated. The\r\nevaluation process uses the XCF allocation algorithm, which factors in the CFRM active policy information\r\nand current set of connections, to make the determination.\r\nTARGET OF REALLOCATE PROCESS\r\nThe structure was selected by the REALLOCATE process to have its location adjusted and/or pending\r\npolicy activated. The REALLOCATE process was initiated by the SETXCF START,REALLOCATE operator\r\ncommand. Once marked as the target of the REALLOCATE process, the structure remains the target until\r\none of the following occurs:\r\nv The REALLOCATE process evaluates the next structure or completes.\r\nv The structure is reduplexed, deallocated, or forced.\r\nREBUILDING\r\nThe structure rebuild process type is rebuild.\r\nREBUILD STOPPING\r\nThe structure rebuild process type is rebuild. The process is being stopped.\r\nDUPLEXING REBUILD\r\nThe structure rebuild process type is duplexing rebuild.\r\nDUPLEXING REBUILD STOPPING\r\nThe structure rebuild process type is duplexing rebuild. The process is being stopped to fall back to the old\r\nstructure.\r\nDUPLEXING REBUILD SWITCHING\r\nThe structure rebuild process type is duplexing rebuild. The process is being stopped to switch to the new\r\nstructure.\r\nMETHOD: method\r\nThe method used to manage the current process (for example, rebuilding, rebuild stopping, or duplexing\r\nrebuild) is one of the following:\r\nSYSTEM-MANAGED\r\nThe system is managing the process.\r\nAUTO VERSION: procid1 procid2\r\nThe version number of the system-managed process. Used to correlate messages and XCF\r\ncomponent trace records associated with the current system-managed process. procid1is the\r\nfirst half of the auto version and procid2is the second half.\r\nUSER-MANAGED\r\nThe connected users are managing the process.\r\nPHASE:phase\r\nThe phase of the current process (for example, rebuilding, rebuild stopping, or duplexing rebuild) is one of\r\nthe following:\r\nWAITING FOR QUIESCE\r\nThe structure rebuild process is in the quiesce phase.\r\nWAITING FOR COMPLETE\r\nThe structure rebuild process is in the complete phase.\r\nWAITING FOR CLEANUP\r\nThe structure rebuild process is in the cleanup phase.\r\nDUPLEX STARTUP\r\nThe structure rebuild process is in the startup phase.\r\nDUPLEX ESTABLISHED\r\nThe structure rebuild process is in the duplex established phase.\r\nDUPLEX SWITCHING\r\nThe structure rebuild process is in the duplex switching phase.\r\nSTARTUP\r\nThe structure rebuild process is in the startup phase.\r\nALLOCATE\r\nThe structure rebuild process is in the allocate phase.\r\nATTACH\r\nThe structure rebuild process is in the attach phase.\r\nCOPY\r\nThe structure rebuild process is in the copy phase.

Except for XCF signaling structures,\r\nmessage-based processing can be used for any allocated structure. When the CFRM event management protocol\r\nis message-based, message-based processing is enabled for an allocated structure during event processing. When\r\nthe CFRM event management protocol is policy-based, event processing is policy-based for all allocated\r\nstructures.\r\nstrem\r\nOne of the following:\r\nPOLICY-BASED\r\nEvent management for an allocated structure is controlled on each system having a structure connection\r\nand the CFRM active policy is accessed to obtain event data.\r\nAfter the message-based protocol is selected for CFRM as a whole, an individual structure may continue\r\nto use policy-based processing until in flight events are completely processed. strem will continue to\r\nshow structure using the policy-based protocol until the next event occurs for that structure, which may\r\nbe quite some time. So even if the sysplex is using message-based protocols, a particular structure could\r\nbe using either protocol. A structure used for XCF Signalling always uses policy-based protocols.\r\nMESSAGE-BASED\r\nEvent management for the allocated structure is controlled by an event manager system using messages\r\nsent by XCF to provide event data and to communicate among the system(s). The manager system\r\nupdates the CFRM active policy once all participant system(s) distribute the event to active connections.\r\nTYPE:\r\nWhen the allocated instance displayed is ACTIVE, REBUILD OLD/NEW, or DUPLEXING REBUILD OLD/NEW,\r\nthe structure type is from the CFRM active policy.\r\nstrtype\r\nOne of the following:\r\nLOCK The structure type is a lock.\r\nSERIALIZED LIST\r\nThe structure type is a serialized list.\r\nLIST The structure type is a list.\r\nCACHE\r\nThe structure type is cache.\r\npolicysize u\r\nThe size of the structure as specified in the active policy.

For example, a policysize of 1048576K may be converted topolicysize of 1G for the\r\npurpose of messages; a policysize of 120000K will not cause the displayed size to be converted because it is not\r\nan even multiple of megabytes, gigabytes, or terabytes.\r\npolicyinitsize u\r\nThe INITSIZE for the structure as specified in the policy. This size is expressed in u. If no INITSIZE was\r\nspecified in the policy, N/A will be displayed.\r\npolicyminsize u\r\nThe MINSIZE for the structure as specified or defaulted to in the policy.

For structure alter processing to be\r\nstarted for the structure, connections must also allow alter.\r\nNO System-initiated alter (automatic alter) of the structure is not allowed.\r\nrebuildpercent\r\nThe REBUILDPERCENT for the structure as specified in the policy. If no REBUILDPERCENT was specified in\r\nthe policy, then N/A will be displayed.\r\nrecprty\r\nThe RECPRTY for the structure as specified in the policy. If no RECPRTY was specified in the policy, then the\r\nline will not be displayed.\r\nsysrecprty\r\nThe RECPRTY for the structure determined by the system. Value of 0 implies RECPRTY is not supported for the\r\nstructure and it will not participate in lossconn recovery management. For more information about lossconn\r\nrecovery management see z/OS MVS Setting Up a Sysplex .\r\nduplexstatus\r\nOne of the following:\r\nENABLED\r\nThe CFRM administrative policy specifies DUPLEX(ENABLED) for this structure.\r\nALLOWED\r\nThe CFRM administrative policy specifies DUPLEX(ALLOWED) for this structure.\r\nDISABLED\r\nThe CFRM administrative policy specifies or defaults to DUPLEX(DISABLED) for this structure.\r\nallowrealloc\r\nOne of the following:\r\nYES\r\nREALLOCATE processing is allowed for the structure.\r\nNO REALLOCATE processing is not allowed for the structure. REALLOCATE processing will evaluate the\r\nstructure but will not start a rebuild when the evaluation indicates that a rebuild is needed.

However, the path has pending I/O that does not appear to be completing in a timely\r\nmanner. If the condition persists, the path will be restarted for a stalled I/O condition.\r\nStalled I/O is often caused by no buffer conditions on the inbound side of the path, which in turn are often\r\ncaused by XCF group members failing to process signals in a timely fashion (refer the explanation of\r\nmessage IXC431I for possible reasons why). Stalled I/O can also be caused by system delays on the inbound\r\nside as well as problems, issues, or errors with the underlying hardware for the signalling path.\r\nSTALL-INOP\r\nThe signalling path appears to be capable of message transfer in that it has established connectivity with the\r\nremote system. However, the path is not considered viable. For example, the inbound side may be\r\nexperiencing no buffer conditions and signals therefore cannot be transferred. If the conditions that make the\r\npath not viable are resolved, the path will once again be used for transferring signals. If not, the path may\r\nbe restarted for a stalled I/O condition.\r\nSTALL-SS?\r\nThe signalling path appears to be capable of message transfer in that it has established connectivity with the\r\nremote system. However, the path is not considered viable and is being monitored for potential sympathy\r\nsickness impact. In particular, the inbound side is experiencing no buffer conditions that appear to be\r\ncaused, at least in part, by one or more stalled XCF group members that have failed to process signals in a\r\ntimely manner. If these delays persist, the outbound side may be impacted as well. If the conditions that\r\nmake the path not viable are resolved, the path will once again be used for transferring signals. If not, the\r\npath may be restarted for a stalled I/O condition.\r\nSTALL-SS\r\nThe signalling path appears to be capable of message transfer in that it has established connectivity with the\r\nremote system. However, the path is not considered viable. The outbound side is suffering from sympathy\r\nsickness since there are signals that cannot be transferred to the inbound side. Signals for the target system\r\nare being delayed and/or rejected because the inbound side is experiencing no buffer conditions that appear\r\nto be caused by one or more stalled XCF group members that have failed to process signals in a timely\r\nmanner. The actual impact is difficult to predict since it will depend on the set of applications and\r\nsubsystems whose signals are being delayed or rejected. In general, processing of work is likely to hang. The\r\nimpact may be isolated to signals in a particular transport class. In some cases the impact can spread to\r\nother transport classes. In the worst case, all signals from the outbound side to the inbound side could be\r\nimpacted.\r\nXCF issues messages IXC440E and IXC640E when such sympathy sickness is detected. XCF may be able to\r\nalleviate the sympathy sickness condition if the current Sysplex Failure Management (SFM) policy\r\nMEMSTALLTIME specification for the target system permits such action. Message IXC615I is issued to\r\nindicate such action, or to request operator intervention if automatic action is not permitted.\r\nrdev\r\nThe device number for the associated inbound or outbound signalling path on the remote system. If the device\r\nnumber is not known, question marks are listed.\r\nretry\r\nThe retry limit for the path. The retry limit is used to determine whether a signalling path should be removed.\r\nmaxmsg\r\nThe amount of space, in kilobytes, of message buffer space defined to the signalling service for the path.\r\nlastrcvd\r\nSignal number of the last signal received over the signalling path. As each signal is queued for transfer over a\r\nsignalling path, it is assigned an over increasing number (subject to wrap). That signal number, modulo 100,000\r\nis displayed for the latest signal to be received. Signal numbers may be reset to lower values when the signalling\r\npath is restarted.\r\nxfertime\r\nThe average transfer time, in microseconds, for signals recently received over the signalling path. Up to 64 of the\r\nlatest signals received over the path are considered when computing the average transfer time. Signals received\r\nmore than a minute ago are excluded from the average. For a seldom used path, excluding old signals can make\r\nit appear that its transfer time is changing even though it is not receiving any new signals. A dash is displayed if\r\nno data is available (no signals recently received or the sending system does not provide the necessary data).\r\nAverage transfer times in excess of a tenth of a second are displayed as 99999. The transfer time shown is\r\nrecomputed using the data that is current at the time the display command is processed.\r\npndmsg\r\nFor an outbound path, indicates the number of signals queued to the path for which I/O transfer appears to be\r\npending. Since notification of I/O completion is asynchronous to the actual I/O transfer, the signals may in fact\r\nhave been transferred to the target system even though the count is not zero.\r\nFor an inbound path, indicates the number of signal buffers associated with the path that are engaged in some\r\nstage of message dilivery. An idle inbound CTC path will usually have four signals pending. An idle inbound\r\nlist path will usually have no signals pending. Delivery counts will be greater than the idle values when the\r\nsignal buffers are in the midst of delivering a message to a user signal exit routine. Delivery counts smaller than\r\nthe idle value (for a CTC path) may be indicative of a signal buffer shortage, which in turn could cause\r\nsignalling performance degradation. Note that some combinations of current buffer length and MAXMSG\r\nspecifications can cause a CTC path to run idle with fewer than four buffers.\r\nFor an inbound path, the number of signal buffers that are pending delivery may be less than the number of\r\nwork items pending delivery to the XCF group members (as shown by the DISPLAY\r\nXCF,GROUP,grpname,memname command). The difference arises from the fact that messages are not the only\r\nwork items that can be queued for a member. Also, XCF does not necessarily use signal I/O buffers to queue\r\nmessages for delivery.\r\nbflen\r\nThe maximum number of bytes of message data that will fit in the size signal buffer that is currently in use by\r\nthe signalling path. The buffer length used by the signalling path is adjusted dynamically by XCF in response to\r\nthe message traffic load.\r\nin_use\r\nThe amount of message buffer space, in kilobytes, currently associated with the signalling path.\r\nNote that for an outbound path, this value may exceed the MAXMSG value specified for the path since\r\noutbound buffer pools are not managed on a path basis but on a transport class basis. The current path value\r\nmay also include signal buffers from other transport classes that do not have their own signalling paths. Signal\r\nbuffers for internal XCF signals, which are managed separately from customer defined transport classes may also\r\nbe included.\r\nsgnl#\r\nEach signal sent over a signalling path is assigned a signal number (subject to wrap). That signal number,\r\nmodulo 100,000 is displayed.\r\nFor an outbound signalling path, this value will be the signal number of the last signal queued for transfer over\r\nthe path. For an inbound signalling path, this value will be the signal number of the latest signal received over\r\nthe path. The signal number of the outbound side of a path can be compared to the signal number of the\r\ninbound side of the path to gauge activity of the signalling path.\r\nSignal numbers may be reset to lower values when the signalling path is started, restarted, or stopped.\r\nnobuff\r\nFor an inbound path, indicates the number of times (modulo 100,000) that lack of a signal buffer prevented a\r\nnew read operation from being initiated over the path. This count is cumulative for the life of the path so a\r\nnonzero value does not imply that the path is currently experiencing a buffer shortage. The value should be\r\ncompared to the data from a subsequent display command to determine whether the path had buffer shortages\r\nrecently.\r\nclassname\r\nThe name of the transport class to which this signalling path is assigned. classnameis only displayed for\r\noutbound signalling paths, and only if a signalling path is assigned to the class.

Duplexing rebuild is not\r\nallowed when the structure is in the failed state.\r\nv The rebuild start request would result in a system-managed rebuild. System-managed rebuild is not\r\nallowed when the structure is in the failed state.\r\nTHE STRUCTURE HAS NO ACTIVE CONNECTORS\r\nThe request would have resulted in a user-managed process, but the structure has no active connectors to\r\nparticipate in structure rebuild processing.\r\nA REBUILD STOP IS IN PROGRESS FOR THE STRUCTURE\r\nRebuild stop is in progress for the structure.\r\nAT LEAST ONE CONNECTOR DOES NOT SUPPORT REBUILD\r\nAt least one of the active connectors to the structure does not support rebuild.\r\nNO SUITABLE COUPLING FACILITY FOR REBUILD WITH LOCATION=OTHER\r\nThe rebuild start request was rejected because LOCATION=OTHER was necessary and no other eligible\r\ncoupling facility was found in the preference list.\r\nNO COUPLING FACILITY PROVIDED BETTER OR EQUIVALENT CONNECTIVITY\r\nNo other facility has better connectivity than the current one. The rebuild would cause a degradation in\r\nconnectivity as determined by SFM system weights, if accepted.\r\nA DUPLEXING REBUILD IS NOT ALLOWED FOR THE STRUCTURE\r\nThe structure does not support duplexing rebuild for one of the following reasons:\r\nv DUPLEX(DISABLED) was specified or defaulted to in the CFRM active policy for the structure.\r\nv There are failed persistent connections that are unavailable until a larger CFRM couple data set is made\r\navailable.\r\nv A user-managed duplexing rebuild could not be started because:\r\n\u2013 User-managed duplexing rebuilds are not supported for the structure type.\r\n\u2013 At least one active or failed-persistent connection specified or defaulted to IXLCONN\r\nALLOWDUPREBLD=NO.\r\nv A system-managed duplexing rebuild could not be started because:\r\n\u2013 The structure has at least one active connector, and none of the connectors (active or failed-persistent)\r\nspecified IXLCONN ALLOWAUTO=YES when connecting.\r\n\u2013 A system-managed duplexing rebuild is not supported when a CFRM policy change is pending for the\r\nstructure.\r\nTHE STRUCTURE DOES NOT SUPPORT SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESSES\r\nThe structure does not support system-managed processes (for example, rebuild) for one of the following\r\nreasons:\r\nv The structure was not allocated in a coupling facility at or above the minimum CFLEVEL required for the\r\ncurrent process by a system supporting system-managed processing.\r\nv The structure has connections that have not been reconciled into the CFRM active policy.\r\nv Structure cleanup is in progress for the structure.\r\nNO SUITABLE COUPLING FACILITY IN PREFERENCE LIST\r\nThe requested system-managed process cannot be initiated for one or more of the following reasons:\r\nv The preference list is empty.\r\nv The preference list contains no other coupling facility at or above the minimum CFLEVEL required for the\r\ncurrent process.\r\nv The structure already exists in the only suitable coupling facility. The same coupling facility can only be\r\nselected as the target for the system-managed rebuild if a CFRM policy change is pending, and either:\r\n\u2013 The policy changes does not involve updates to the SIZE or INITSIZE values, or\r\n\u2013 the policy change does involve updates to SIZE or INITSIZE and all the structure connectors specified\r\nIXLCONN ALLOWALTER=YES.\r\nv A potentially suitable coupling facility does not permit structure allocation.\r\nCONNECTORS DO NOT SUPPORT SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESSES\r\nThe structure has at least one active connector, and at least one of the connectors (active or failed-persistent)\r\ndid not specify IXLCONN ALLOWAUTO=YES when connecting.\r\nAT LEAST ONE CONNECTOR HAS LOST CONNECTIVITY\r\nThe requested system-managed process (for example, rebuild) cannot be initiated because one or more of the\r\nconnectors to the target structure has lost connectivity.\r\nTHE CFRM CDS DOES NOT SUPPORT SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESS\r\nThe CFRM couple data set does not support the requested system-managed process (for example, rebuild),\r\nbecause the CFRM couple data set was not formatted at or above the minimum version for the\r\nsystem-managed process requested. Use the DISPLAY XCF,COUPLE,TYPE=CFRM command to determine\r\nthe format of the CFRM couple data set. To support system-managed rebuild the CFRM couple data set\r\nshould be formatted specifying \"ITEM NAME(SMREBLD) NUMBER(1)\". For system-managed duplexing\r\nrebuild, \"ITEM NAME(SMDUPLEX) NUMBER(1)\" implicitly formats a CFRM couple data set that supports\r\nboth system-managed rebuild and system-managed duplexing rebuild.\r\nA STRUCTURE WITH NO CONNECTORS HAS NEVER BEEN SYSTEM-MANAGED DUPLEXED\r\nA system-managed duplexing rebuild cannot be initiated because there are no connections to the structure\r\nand the structure has not previously been duplexed using system-managed processing.\r\nA CFRM ACTIVE POLICY DATA AREA COULD NOT BE OBTAINED\r\nThe requested system-managed process (for example, rebuild) cannot be initiated because the necessary\r\nCFRM active policy data area could not be obtained.\r\nALLOCATION OF REBUILD NEW STRUCTURE FOR DUPLEXING REBUILD NOT FEASIBLE\r\nAllocation of the rebuild new structure instance in support of a duplexing rebuild is not feasible. Message IXC574I contains additional diagnostic information.

The REALLOCATE process predetermines the necessary steps and if\r\none or more of these steps cannot start structure rebuild processing then IXC546I is issued to provide the reason and\r\ntype of structure rebuild process. Structure rebuild process type can be either rebuild or duplexing rebuild.\r\nUse the DISPLAY XCF,STR,STRNAME= strname operator command to show the current state of the structure.

Perhaps the exit routine is suspended waiting to obtain the local\r\nlock or a latch.\r\nv SRBs not dispatched in a timely manner. Perhaps the member address space is swapped out or a dump is in\r\nprogress. Perhaps the dispatch priority of the member address space is too low. Perhaps a loop in some other work\r\nunit is consuming most of the CPU resource. The looping work unit need not be in the member address space. It\r\ncould be in an address space other than those identified by the IXC633I message.\r\nv An influx of work has exceeded the processing capacity of the member or system. The influx may be a temporary\r\nspike that the system can work through with time. It could be the residual effect of some other problem that\r\ncaused processing of an otherwise normal workload to be delayed.\r\nv Some other member or system in the sysplex is not processing its work in a timely manner. Although XCF may\r\nhave identified the indicated member as stalled, the situation could be the result of sympathy sickness arising from\r\nprocessing delays elsewhere in the sysplex (which may or may not have been identified).\r\nv A member or system might be engaged in reconfiguration or recovery processes that must complete before normal\r\nprocessing can proceed.

At the direction of the system\r\nprogrammer, you may need to obtain dumps for problem diagnosis or terminate the indicated application.\r\nXCF monitors its own internal use of the XCF signalling service and may issue message IXC633I if XCF itself appears\r\nto be impaired. However, the DISPLAY XCF,GROUP command cannot be used to investigate such impairment\r\nconditions because the command does not support the internal XCF group.\r\nSystem programmer response: Check the status of the indicated application or subsystem. If multiple members\r\nappear to be impaired, or if other indicators suggest work is not being processed, there may be an underlying\r\nproblem affecting them all. If so, a broader system diagnosis my be warranted because the impacted members may\r\nnot be at fault. On many occasions the system will successfully resolve the situation during the course of normal\r\nprocessing, in which case no further action is warranted. If necessary, take appropriate action to correct the situation,\r\ncancel or terminate the application. Before terminating the application, issue DISPLAY XCF,GROUP,grpname ,ALL and\r\nany relevant application display, then collect the following diagnostic information: system log, application log, and an\r\nappropriate dump. In addition to application specific diagnostic data, the dump should include XCF data\r\n(SDATA=COUPLE).

This can be because the hardware necessary to provide XES functions is not\r\npresent.\r\nAN UNEXPECTED ERROR OCCURRED\r\nAn unexpected error occurred during rebuild processing.\r\nNO ELIGIBLE STRUCTURES FOUND IN COUPLING FACILITY\r\nOn a rebuild start request, no structures eligible for rebuild were found in the coupling facility specified. On\r\na rebuild stop request, no structures eligible for rebuild stop were found in the coupling facility specified.\r\nCOUPLING FACILITY NOT DEFINED IN THE CFRM ACTIVE POLICY\r\nThe coupling facility is not defined in the CFRM active policy.\r\nNO COUPLING FACILITY PROVIDED BETTER CONNECTIVITY\r\nNo other facility has better connectivity than the current one. The rebuild, which was initiated because of a\r\nloss of connectivity, would cause a further degradation in connectivity if accepted. The system evaluated the\r\nset of active connections that lost connectivity to the current structure as compared with the set of active\r\nconnections that would not be able to connect to the rebuild new structure. The system terminates structure\r\nrebuild processing because the result of the rebuild would cause additional active connections to lose\r\nconnectivity.\r\nNO COUPLING FACILITY PROVIDED BETTER OR EQUIVALENT CONNECTIVITY\r\nNo other facility has better connectivity than the current one. The rebuild would cause a degradation in\r\nconnectivity as determined by SFM system weights, if accepted.\r\nNote: When this reason is received for an operator initiated rebuild by STRNAME or CFNAME and the\r\ninstallation needs to rebuild the structures, a SETXCF START,REBUILD command specifying\r\nLESSCONN=CONTINUE can be used to force the rebuild to continue despite this condition. Because this\r\nmight cause active connections to the structure to lose connectivity to the structure, do not use\r\nLESSCONN=CONTINUE unless you understand the impact to the application or subsystem. Consult the\r\napplication or subsystem documentation for recommendations.\r\nXCF SIGNALLING STRUCTURES CANNOT BE REBUILT USING CFNAME KEYWORD\r\nDue to the availability constraints of XCF Signalling Structures, these structures cannot be rebuilt using the\r\nCFNAME option. They must be rebuilt individually using the STRNAME option.\r\nDUPLEXING REBUILD NOT ALLOWED FOR THE STRUCTURE\r\nThe structure does not support duplexing rebuild for one of the following reasons:\r\nv DUPLEX(DISABLED) was specified or defaulted to in the CFRM active policy for the structure.\r\nv There are failed-persistent connections that are unavailable until a larger CFRM couple data set is made\r\navailable.\r\nv A user-managed duplexing rebuild could not be started because:\r\n\u2013 User-managed duplexing rebuilds are not supported for the structure type.\r\n\u2013 At least one active or failed-persistent connection specified or defaulted to IXLCONN\r\nALLOWDUPREBLD=NO.\r\nv A system-managed duplexing rebuild could not be started because:\r\n\u2013 The structure has at least one active connector, and none of the connectors (active or failed-persistent)\r\nspecified IXLCONN ALLOWAUTO=YES when connecting.\r\n\u2013 A system-managed duplexing rebuild is not supported when a CFRM policy change is pending for the\r\nstructure.\r\nTYPE OF STOP REQUEST DOES NOT MATCH TYPE OF REBUILD IN PROGRESS\r\nSETXCF STOP,REBUILD or IXLREBLD REQUEST=STOP was issued to stop a duplexing rebuild OR SETXCF\r\nSTOP,REBUILD,DUPLEX or IXLREBLD REQUEST=STOPDUPLEX was requested to stop a non-duplexing\r\nrebuild.\r\nDUPLEXING NOT ESTABLISHED, CANNOT STOP TO KEEP NEW STRUCTURE\r\nSETXCF STOP,REBUILD,DUPLEX,KEEP=NEW or IXLREBLD REQUEST=STOPDUPLEX KEEP=NEW was\r\nrequested and the rebuild has not yet entered the duplex established phase. Stop requests to switch to the\r\nnew structure are not accepted until the rebuild enters the duplex established phase.\r\nALREADY STOPPING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION\r\nThe request to stop a duplexing rebuild was not processed because duplex rebuild stop has already been\r\ninitiated for this structure name in the other direction. Either KEEP=OLD was requested and KEEP=NEW\r\ntype of duplex rebuild stop is in progress or KEEP=NEW was requested and KEEP=OLD type of duplex\r\nrebuild stop is in progress.\r\nSTRUCTURE HAS FAILED\r\nThe rebuild start request was rejected for one of the following reasons:\r\nv The request was to start a duplexing rebuild and the structure has failed. Duplexing rebuild is not\r\nallowed when the structure is in the failed state.\r\nv The rebuild start request would result in a system-managed rebuild. System-managed rebuild is not\r\nallowed when the structure is in the failed state.\r\nNO OTHER COUPLING FACILITY FOUND IN PREFERENCE LIST\r\nOn a rebuild start request, either LOCATION=OTHER was specified or defaulted to for a request to start a\r\nduplexing rebuild. In addition to avoiding the facility in which the structure is currently allocated, when a\r\nduplexing rebuild is stopped by the operator and DUPLEX(ENABLED) is specified in the active policy, the\r\nsubsequent duplexing request initiated due to DUPLEX(ENABLED) will avoid the coupling facility in which\r\nthe previous instance of the structure was allocated when the duplexing rebuild was stopped.\r\nSTRUCTURE DOES NOT SUPPORT SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESSES\r\nThe structure does not support system-managed processes (for example, rebuild) for one of the following\r\nreasons:\r\nv The structure was not allocated in a coupling facility at or above the minimum CFLEVEL required for the\r\ncurrent process by a system supporting system-managed processing.\r\nv The structure has connections that have not been reconciled into the CFRM active policy.\r\nv Structure cleanup is in progress for the structure.\r\nCONNECTORS DO NOT SUPPORT SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESSES\r\nThe requested system-managed process cannot be initiated for one of the following reasons:\r\nv The structure has at least one active connector, and at least one of the connectors (active or\r\nfailed-persistent) did not specify IXLCONN ALLOWAUTO=YES when connecting.\r\nv A duplexing rebuild cannot be initiated for a structure that has only failed-persistent connectors, and at\r\nleast one of the failed-persistent connectors did not specify IXLCONN ALLOWAUTO=YES when\r\nconnecting.\r\nNO SUITABLE COUPLING FACILITY IN PREFERENCE LIST\r\nThe requested system-managed process cannot be initiated for one or more of the following reasons:\r\nv The preference list is empty.\r\nv The preference list contains no other coupling facility at or above the minimum CFLEVEL required for the\r\ncurrent process.\r\nv The structure already exists in the only suitable coupling facility. The same coupling facility can only be\r\nselected as the target for the system-managed process if a CFRM policy change is pending for the\r\nstructure and one of the following is true:\r\n\u2013 The policy change does not affect the SIZE or the INITSIZE parameters.\r\n\u2013 The policy change affects the SIZE or the INITSIZE parameter and all of the structure connectors\r\nspecified IXLCONN ALLOWALTER=YES.\r\nv A potentially suitable coupling facility does not permit structure allocation.\r\nSTART REASON INAPPROPRIATE FOR SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESS\r\nAn IXLREBLD REQUEST=START invocation would have resulted in system-managed processing (for\r\nexample, rebuild). The request specified a STARTREASON of LOSSCONN or STRFAILURE, which are not\r\nvalid reasons for the requested process.\r\nAT LEAST ONE CONNECTOR HAS LOST CONNECTIVITY TO THE STRUCTURE\r\nThe requested system-managed process (for example, rebuild) cannot be initiated because one or more of the\r\nconnectors to the target structure has lost connectivity to the coupling facility containing the target structure.\r\nCFRM COUPLE DATA SET DOES NOT SUPPORT SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESS\r\nThe CFRM couple data set does not support the requested system-managed process (for example, rebuild)\r\nbecause the CFRM couple data set was not formatted at or above the minimum version for the\r\nsystem-managed process requested. Use the DISPLAY XCF,COUPLE,TYPE=CFRM command to determine\r\nthe format of the CFRM couple data set. To support system-managed rebuild the CFRM couple data set\r\nshould be formatted specifying \u201cITEM NAME(SMREBLD) NUMBER(1)\u201d. For system-managed duplexing\r\nrebuild, \u201cITEM NAME(SMDUPLEX) NUMBER(1)\u201d should also be specified when formatting a CFRM couple\r\ndata set. Specifying \u201cITEM NAME(SMDUPLEX) NUMBER(1)\u201d implicitly formats a CFRM couple data set\r\nthat supports both system-managed rebuild and system-managed duplexing rebuild.\r\nSTRUCTURE WITH NO CONNECTORS HAS NEVER BEEN SYSTEM-MANAGED DUPLEXED\r\nA system-managed duplexing rebuild cannot be initiated because there are no connections to the structure\r\nand the structure has not previously been duplexed using system-managed processing.\r\nALLOCATION OF REBUILD NEW STRUCTURE FOR DUPLEXING REBUILD NOT FEASIBLE\r\nAllocation of the rebuild new structure instance in support of a duplexing rebuild is not feasible. Message IXC574I will contain additional diagnostic information.\r\nSTRUCTURE OBJECTS IN STORAGE-CLASS MEMORY\r\nThe duplexing rebuild could not be started because storage-class memory is in use.\r\nthread\r\nUsed to tie together messages and XCF component trace records for a particular coupling facility rebuild process.\r\nSystem action: The system does not process the request for that structure. Requested processing continues for those\r\nstructures which had structure rebuild processing successfully started or stopped.\r\nOperator response: Contact the system programmer for advice and assistance in determining whether to manually\r\nmove the structures or cancel the rest of the CFNAME level rebuild. Ensure the IXC528I messages are preserved for\r\nthe system programmer to use in determining next action.\r\nSystem programmer response: Examine the IXC528I messages for the correct next action. Note that depending on\r\nthe application using the structure, structure rebuild may not be possible.

The REALLOCATE process initiated by\r\nthe SETXCF START,REALLOCATE operator command examines each allocated structure to determine\r\nwhether the location of any of the instance(s) needs to be adjusted and/or a pending policy activated. The\r\nevaluation process uses the XCF allocation algorithm, which factors in the CFRM active policy information\r\nand current set of connections, to make the determination.\r\nTARGET OF REALLOCATE PROCESS\r\nThe structure was selected by the REALLOCATE process to have its location adjusted and/or pending\r\npolicy activated.

Except for XCF signaling structures,\r\nmessage-based processing can be used for any allocated structure. When the CFRM event management protocol\r\nis message-based, message-based processing is enabled for an allocated structure during event processing. When\r\nthe CFRM event management protocol is policy-based, event processing is policy-based for all allocated\r\nstructures.\r\nevtmgmt\r\nOne of the following:\r\nPOLICY-BASED\r\nFor the sysplex, event management for an allocated structure is controlled on each system that has a\r\nstructure connection and the CFRM active policy is accessed to obtain event data.\r\nMESSAGE-BASED MANAGER SYSTEM NAME: mgrsysname\r\nFor the sysplex, allocated structures that are enabled for message-based processing have event processing\r\nmanaged by an event manager system using messages sent through XCF signaling for communication with\r\nthe participant system(s). The manager system updates the CFRM active policy once all participant system(s)\r\ndistribute the event to active connections. The event manager system is identified by mgrsysname.\r\nMESSAGE-BASED TRANSITIONING TO NEW MANAGER\r\nFor the sysplex, allocated structures that are enabled for message-based processing have event processing\r\nmanaged by an event manager system, but the sysplex is transitioning to a new manager system. When the\r\nnew manager system is assigned, the name of the event manager system can be displayed. The sysplex\r\nchanges to a new manager system as the result of removing the prior manager system from the sysplex.\r\nmsgbasedlevel\r\nThe level of message-based event processing being used by CFRM. Message-based processing can be restarted by\r\nthe system if a system in the sysplex does not support this level. Message-based processing can also be restarted\r\nby the system to increase this level. There may be functions that require a particular level. For example, the\r\nCFLCRMGMT function requires a level that is not supported by levels of z/OS lower than V2R2.

System logger might eventually fail log stream offloads if it\r\ncannot obtain a log data set directory extent required to process the offload. The system issues this message if the\r\nnumber of in-use log data set directory extent records in the active LOGR couple data set exceeds 85 percent of the\r\ntotal number of log data set directory extent records in the LOGR couple data set. The counts in the message are the\r\nvalues that existed when the condition was detected.

Shortage is relieved\r\nThis means that the number of in-use log data set directory extent records has dropped below 80 percent of the\r\ntotal formatted in the active primary LOGR couple data set for the PRODUCTION group.\r\nThis could happen either as a result of system activity resulting in a number of log data set directory extent\r\nrecords being freed from log streams, thus increasing the available pool for the PRODUCTION group or because\r\na new LOGR couple data set was brought into the sysplex as the primary LOGR couple data set and this LOGR\r\ncouple data set was formatted with a larger number of log data set directory extent records.\r\nThe shortage could also be relieved if the activities of TEST group log streams are reduced by deleting TEST\r\ngroup log streams or by reducing the retention period for log data associated with TEST group log streams.\r\nIf this storage is relieved, this message will be deleted (DOMed).\r\n2. Shortage becomes critical\r\nThis means that the number of in-use log data set directory extent records has exceeded 95 percent of the total\r\nformatted in the active primary LOGR couple data set.\r\nIf this occurs, the system will issue message IXG262A to notify you of the critical shortage.\r\nOperator response: Notify the system programmer.\r\nSystem programmer response: You must increase the pool of available log data set directory extent records in the\r\nactive primary LOGR couple data set. You can increase the available pool in one of the following two ways:\r\n1. Formatting a new LOGR couple data set.\r\nYou can format a new LOGR couple data set and increase the number of log data set directory extent records\r\nthrough the DSEXTENT keyword on the couple data set format utility. As help in determining the number of\r\nadditional log data set directory extent records to specify, this message includes the total number of log data set\r\ndirectory extent records that are formatted in active primary LOGR couple data set, numTotal , the number of\r\ncurrently in-use log data set directory extent records, numInuse, and the number of currently available log data set\r\ndirectory extent records, numAvail.\r\nTo relieve the shortage, you must reduce the number of in-use log data set directory extent records to below 80\r\npercent of the total formatted.\r\n2. Freeing log data set directory extents from existing log streams.\r\nYou can also relieve the shortage by freeing log data set directory extent records being consumed by existing log\r\nstream definitions. You can free log data set directory extent records in two different ways:\r\na. Deleting log stream definitions.\r\nIf you can identify unnecessary log stream definitions that are consuming log data set directory extents,\r\ndeleting the log stream definition will immediately free the log data set directory extents associated with that\r\nlog stream back into the available pool.\r\nAs an aid in detecting unnecessary log stream definitions, check the log stream GROUP attribute. You can\r\ndelete TEST group log streams before you delete PRODUCTION group log streams.\r\nb. Reducing the retention period for log data.\r\nIf you can identify log streams that are defined with excessive retention periods and these log streams are\r\nconsuming log data set directory extent records, you can free up log data set directory extent records by\r\nreducing the retention period, thus increasing the available pool.\r\nFor TEST group based log streams, you can make the retention period small so that the data can be quickly\r\ndeleted, thus occupying less directory extent records.\r\nNote: System logger does not necessarily react immediately to reductions in the retention period. The rule for\r\nwhen system logger will process reductions in the retention period is upon the next log data set switch event\r\nfor the log stream. This implies that the log stream must be connected and incurring sufficient write activity to\r\nforce data set switch events.\r\nYou can run a report of the log streams defined in the LOGR couple data set to help you identify candidates\r\nfor cleanup.

The\r\nmost likely cause of this problem is that the Coupling Facility which contains the newly allocated structure does\r\nnot have enough space available to allocate the structure at the requested size.\r\nEither more space needs to be made available in the coupling facility, or the structure needs to be allocated in a\r\ncoupling facility that can accommodate it. More space can be made available in a coupling facility by causing\r\nstructures to be deallocated from that facility, or by decreasing the amount of space reserved for structure\r\ndumps.

System logger waits for the operator to specify an\r\naction, or for the allocation to complete by itself.

Review these message descriptions as well. See z/OS MVS Setting Up a\r\nSysplex\u201cOffload and Service Task Monitoring\u201d, for more information about the relationship and considerations for\r\nthese action messages.\r\nIf no response is made, the offload allocation may still finish normally. If you decide to respond, the remifications of\r\neach response are explained here.\r\nMONITOR\r\nThe system logger Event Monitor continues to monitor the offload and takes no overt action. If the offload\r\nallocation is still not complete after another interval, another WTOR will be issued at that time.\r\nIf you reply MONITOR, it is possible that subsequent messages issued may contain different data set names\r\nthan the previous set of messages, as system logger goes through offload processing such as HSM recalls,\r\ndata set switches, and deleting old data sets that are no longer needed. This indicates that while progress is\r\nbeing made internally, the original offload activity still may be delayed until all the internal processes are\r\ncomplete.\r\nWhen you reply MONITOR, any subsequent IXG311I messages issued will show an offload delay duration.\r\nThe delay duration can be used to determine if a new delay is being seen, or if the delay is ongoing, i.e., the\r\ndelay value is increasing.\r\nIGNORE\r\nThe system logger Event Monitor stops monitoring this offload allocation. It may be that there is no problem\r\nwith this offload allocation, it is simply taking a long time.\r\nFAIL The offload will be cancelled on this system. This may allow other work to continue that was waiting for\r\nsystem logger allocation resources. System logger will attempt to restart the offload on another system, if\r\nthere is another system in the sysplex that is connected to the same structure as this log stream. If another\r\nsystem cannot be found, the offload will be restarted on the same system.\r\nAUTOFAIL\r\nThis response has the same effect as FAIL for the current log stream offload activity, plus the response affects\r\nfuture offload delay conditions for the same log stream while it is connected on this system.\r\nFor the current log stream offload, the offload will be cancelled on this system. This may allow other work\r\nto continue that was waiting for system logger allocation resources. System logger will attempt to restart the\r\noffload on another system, if there is another system in the sysplex that is connected to the same structure\r\nas this log stream. If another system cannot be found, the offload will be restarted on the same system.\r\nWhen future offload delays occur for this log stream on this system which would normally result in\r\nmessage IXG312E being issued, system logger will automatically handle the condition as if a \u201cFAIL\u201d reply\r\nwas specified. This automatic action will occur for the log stream specified in the IXG312E message while\r\nthe connection is maintained on this system.\r\nMessage IXG313I will be issued when AUTOFAIL is specified.\r\nEXIT The system logger Event Monitor terminates ALL monitoring activity on this system. There will be no\r\nmessages indicating log stream offload activity being delayed, and there will be no mechanism available to\r\nquiesce (fail) any delayed log stream offloads. In this case, the system also issues message IXG314I. System\r\nlogger service task monitoring will be unaffected by this response.

When a structure is allocated with a\r\nDUPLEX value of either ALLOWED or ENABLED, the structure should be duplexed to support intended\r\nredundancy and recoverability. Duplexing a structure provides redundancy that eliminates a single point of failure.\r\nFailure to start a duplexing rebuild usually means that the environmental conditions required for a duplexing rebuild\r\nhave not all been met, and that you might or might need to take any action.\r\nCHECK(IBMXCF,XCF_CF_STR_DUPLEX) issues this message to indicate that one or more structures that could\r\npotentially be duplexed have not been. When a structure is not duplexed, it might be an oversight that leaves the\r\nstructure with less redundancy/recoverability than was intended.\r\nSee message IXCH0920I in the message buffer, for a list of the CF structures including the DUPLEX value specified in\r\nthe CFRM active policy and the current status of the structure.

See Offload and Service Task\r\nMonitoring inz/OS MVS Setting Up a Sysplex for more information about the relationship and considerations for\r\nthese action messages.\r\nIf the system makes no response, the Task might still finish the request normally resulting in message IXG272E being\r\nDOMed. If you decide to respond, you can find the explanation of the ramifications of each response as follows.\r\nMONITOR\r\nThe system logger Event Monitor continues to Monitor the request and takes no overt action. If the specific\r\nrequest has not made progress after another interval, the system will issue another WTOR at that time.\r\nWhen you reply MONITOR, any subsequent IXG271I messages issued will show a delay duration.

It might be that there is no problem with\r\nthis request, it is simply taking a long time, and this is acceptable to the installation, (e.g. HSM Recalls for\r\ndata sets).\r\nFAIL The request will be interrupted on this system. This will most likely cause the request to behave as if it\r\nfailed (e.g. a data set could not be allocated).\r\nThis can also allow other work to continue that was waiting for this system logger service task. Use this\r\noption only if you cannot determine why the request is not completed.\r\nReplying FAIL might cause undesirable results, and is meant to keep the rest of the system logger\r\napplications running, at the expense of one hung application.\r\nTake note of any other system logger error messages or messages from any exploiter of the affected log\r\nstream.\r\nIf you reply FAIL, system logger might cause other components such as Allocation to enter their Recovery,\r\ntake dumps, or issue various messages.\r\nEXIT The system logger event monitor terminates ALL service task monitoring activity on this system.

A stalled\r\nmember could be processing all its other XCF work in a timely manner. See the explanation of message IXC431I for a\r\ndescription of situations that could make a member appear stalled.\r\nNote: It is very unlikely that the delays are caused by a problem in XCF.\r\nIt may not be possible to determine the impact to the sysplex, system, or relevant application without understanding\r\nthe type and nature of the work item(s) experiencing the delay. The impact may not be limited to the stalled member\r\nif it provides services to other applications or subsystems the sysplex.

If an\r\ninternal XCF problem is discovered, a dump will be taken. An entry in logrec is made to document the situation even\r\nif no dump is taken.\r\nOperator response: Monitor the situation. If there does not seem to be any detrimental impact, no further action\r\nmay be needed. On many occasions the system will successfully resolve the situation during the course of normal\r\nprocessing.

For system initiated requests,\r\nthe existing XCF path definition is used to determine the direction(s) in which to stop the path.\r\nUNCOND=YES\r\nUNCOND=YES was coded on the SETXCF command, indicating that the stop was performed unconditionally.\r\nAn unconditional stop may have abnormally terminated other tasks in the midst of processing requests (such as\r\na stop) for the indicated path. An unconditional stop attempts to force stop path processing to run to completion,\r\nand may not wait for an orderly shutdown of the signalling path. For example, an unconditional stop could\r\nprevent XCF from delivering a signal to its intended target.\r\npathname\r\nThe name of the signalling path.\r\nDEVICE dev\r\nIndicates the CTC device with device number dev.\r\nSTRUCTUREstrname\r\nIndicates the XES list structure whose name is strname.

The path is stopped because it is considered to\r\nbe non-operational. The problem can be:\r\nv I/O errors occurred on the path.\r\nv An incorrect COUPLExx parmlib member was specified.\r\nv The specified COUPLExx parmlib member had signalling path definition errors. For instance, the retry limit\r\ncan be exceeded if both sides of a signalling path were started in the same direction. See the explanation for\r\nthe message text OTHER SIDE IS SAME DIRECTION.\r\nSYSPLEX PARTITIONING OF LOCAL SYSTEM\r\nThe path was stopped because the local system is no longer in the sysplex. If the local system was active in the\r\nsysplex, it enters a wait-state upon completion of sysplex partitioning. If the system was attempting to IPL into a\r\nsysplex but never became active, all paths are stopped before the operator is prompted by message IXC207A to\r\nrespecify a new COUPLExx parmlib member.\r\nSYSPLEX PARTITIONING OF REMOTE SYSTEM\r\nThe system to which the path had last established signalling connectivity is being removed from the sysplex. The\r\ninitiator of the partitioning request specifies whether the systems remaining in the sysplex are to retain the\r\nsignalling paths used to communicate with the removed system. If the paths are not to be retained, this path\r\nbecomes undefined to XCF for signalling upon completion of the stop. To redefine the path to XCF for signalling,\r\nthe operator must enter a SETXCF START path command. If the paths are to be retained after the system is\r\nremoved from the sysplex, this path remains defined to XCF for signalling.\r\nOTHER SIDE IS SAME DIRECTION\r\nXCF tried to establish signalling connectivity between two systems, but the signalling path was defined in the\r\nsame direction on both systems. A signalling path must have an outbound side and an inbound side. If both\r\nsides are defined in the same directions, messages cannot travel between the two systems involved.\r\nEither of the two systems involved can detect the problem. However the message appears only on one system.\r\nNo response or acknowledgment is provided about this condition to the other system involved.\r\nSUBCHANNEL NOT OPERATIONAL FOR RESUME\r\nThe subchannel is not operational for one of the following reasons:\r\nv No subchannel is provided.\r\nv The subchannel did not have a valid device number assigned.\r\nv The subchannel is not enabled.\r\nSTART REQUEST FAILED\r\nA request to start a signalling path failed. Message IXC305I explains why the start request failed.\r\nCONNECTED TO NON-XCF SIGNALLER\r\nThe other end of this signalling path is not under XCF control. Either the signalling path is not connected to a\r\nsystem in the sysplex, or another application is trying to use the signalling path. A signalling path can only be\r\nused for communication between two systems active in the same sysplex and both ends of the path must be\r\nunder XCF's exclusive control in order to ensure correct operation of the signalling service.\r\nNON-XCF SIGNALLER USING PATH\r\nA non-XCF application tried to use this system's signalling path. Paths used by XCF must be dedicated\r\nexclusively to XCF in order to ensure correct operation of the signalling service.\r\nHALT I/O FAILED\r\nThe system tried to stop all I/O through this path, but the request failed. For a CTC signalling path, The CTC\r\ndevice is probably in a permanent error state.\r\nPURGE I/O FAILED\r\nAn attempt to remove all I/O queued for the signalling path failed.\r\nCONTROL OPERATION FAILED\r\nXCF performs various to read and write operations to manage use of a list structure for signalling. One of these\r\ncontrol operations failed.\r\nINTERNAL ERROR\r\nAn XCF internal error occurred.\r\nCONNECT TOKEN NO LONGER VALID\r\nThe connect token used when invoking XES services to access the list structure is no longer valid. The connect\r\ntoken is returned by the IXLCONN service.\r\nLOST CONNECTIVITY TO STRUCTURE\r\nThis system lost connectivity to the coupling facility that contains the structure.\r\nSTRUCTURE FAILURE\r\nUse of the list structure for signalling is stopped due to a structure failure.\r\nPROPAGATING STOP OF STRUCTURE\r\nA stop request is in progress for a list structure. All the associated list paths must be stopped as well.\r\nOTHER SYSTEM STOPPING ITS SIDE OF PATH\r\nThe other system to which the signalling path is connected is stopping its side of the path. Since the path is no\r\nlonger needed, this system also stops its side of the path. For example, if a system stops using a list structure for\r\noutbound signal traffic, all the systems using the structure for inbound signal traffic can stop their inbound list\r\npaths.\r\nNO LIST AVAILABLE FOR USE\r\nA list path no longer has a list allocated within the list structure for it to use. For example, a rebuilt structure\r\nmay not have a list for the list path to use, whereas the original structure did.\r\nREBUILD FAILED, UNABLE TO USE ORIGINAL\r\nA structure rebuild was initiated. The rebuild attempt failed and this system is unable to use the original list\r\nstructure.\r\nNOT DEFINED AS PATHOUT OR PATHIN\r\nThe list structure is defined for neither outbound signal traffic nor inbound signal traffic. XCF disconnects from\r\nthe structure.\r\nUNABLE TO START LIST MONITORING\r\nXCF was unable to start monitoring a list for from empty to non-empty. The signalling service cannot deliver\r\nsignals without the ability to monitor list transitions. Depending on the list involved, failure to establish\r\nmonitoring may impact a particular list path or use of the whole structure.\r\nUNABLE TO USE REBUILT STRUCTURE\r\nThe list structure has been rebuilt, but this system cannot use the rebuilt structure. Although this system may\r\nlose signalling capacity by stopping its use of the list structure, it does not lose signalling connectivity. So the\r\nother systems in the sysplex are permitted to continue on with the rebuilt structure, and this system disconnects\r\nfrom the structure.\r\nUNABLE TO START REBUILD\r\nThe list structure is not usable. An attempt was made to rebuild the structure, but the rebuild could not be\r\nstarted.\r\nNO SIGNALLING CONNECTIVITY\r\nA signalling path in the midst of stop processing was unconditionally stopped due to a lack of signalling\r\nconnectivity. The unconditional stop forces stop processing to complete so that the path can be started again. It is\r\nhoped that the path will re-establish signalling connectivity after it is started. Such an unconditional stop is\r\nperformed only if the path would remain defined to XCF upon completion of the stop and only if the path is\r\nconnected to a system running MVS/ESA SP510 (or later).\r\nSTOP STRUCTURE PROCESSING\r\nA stop request is in progress for a list structure, so all the associated list signalling paths must be stopped. An\r\nunconditional stop request was already initiated for the list path. To ensure the stop structure processing\r\ncompletes, a new unconditional stop request is initiated for the list path.\r\nCONNECTOR HANG RESOLUTION\r\nA structure-related process associated with this list structure appears to be hung because of failure to receive a\r\nconnector response. The system has stopped signaling paths through the structure to cause XCF to disconnect\r\nand thereby relieve the hang.\r\nREASON UNKNOWN\r\nXCF cannot determine why the signalling path was stopped.\r\n DIAG039:n\r\nDiagnostic data provided to assist IBM service personnel with problem determination.\r\n DIAG040:n\r\nDiagnostic data provided to assist IBM service personnel with problem determination.\r\nSystem action: The signalling path is not used for delivering signals. For an operator initiated stop command, the\r\nsignalling path is no longer defined to XCF in the indicated direction(s). For a system initiated stop request, the\r\nsignalling path remains defined to XCF in an INOPERATIVE state. Since a list signalling path is implicitly defined to\r\nXCF by virtue of how other systems use the list structure for signalling, it is placed in an INOPERATIVE state only\r\nto highlight the failure of a path that should be in use. If the list path is stopped as the result of normal processing, it\r\nbecomes undefined.\r\nIf the path remains defined to XCF for signalling the system may automatically start the path again as a result of\r\nvarious events or circumstances. This applies to list paths that are implicitly defined as well.\r\nOperator response: Depending on the message text, do one of the following:\r\nSUBCHANNEL NOT OPERATIONAL FOR RESUME\r\nHALT I/O FAILED\r\nPURGE I/O FAILED\r\nContact hardware support.\r\nOTHER SIDE SAME DIRECTION\r\nCorrect the signalling path that is going in the wrong direction as follows:\r\nv If the path is not defined to XCF, enter a SETXCF START path command to start the path in the correct\r\ndirection.\r\nv To correct a signalling path that is still defined to XCF, enter a SETXCF STOP path command to stop the path.\r\nThen enter a a SETXCF START path command to start the path in the correct direction.\r\nIf the path was stopped due to a failure, enter a SETXCF START path command to try starting the path again. If the\r\nproblem persists, notify the system programmer.\r\nSystem programmer response: For each of the systems that were to use the signalling path:\r\nv Make sure that the signalling path is correctly defined to XCF. The path was defined either in the COUPLExx\r\nparmlib member used to initialize XCF, or with a SETXCF START path operator command.\r\nv Make sure that the correct COUPLExx parmlib member was specified.\r\nv Make sure that the path is being used only by XCF.\r\nv Examine the logrec error records for I/O errors related to this path.\r\nv Examine the system log for other messages related to this path.\r\nv Ask the operator to enter DISPLAY XCF path commands to obtain detailed status information about the signalling\r\npath.\r\nIf the problem persists, search problem reporting data bases for a fix for the problem. If no fix exists, contact the IBM\r\nSupport Center. Provide XCF component trace data, any logrec error records, and the system logs. Provide any dump\r\ntaken as the result of an internal XCF error.\r\nSource: Cross System Coupling Facility (SCXCF)\r\nModule: IXCT1FSP, IXCT1FSS, IXCT1PCC\r\nRouting code: 1,2\r\nDescriptor code: 5", "IXCH0112I": " This check is not applicable because the couple data set types to which it applies are not in use in the sysplex.\r\nExplanation: CHECK(IBMXCF,XCF_CDS_SEPARATION) is not applicable in the current environment.\r\nSystem action: The system will discontinue running the specified check.\r\nOperator response: N/A\r\nSystem programmer response: N/A\r\nProblem determination: N/A\r\nSource: Parallel Sysplex (XCF)\r\nModule: IXCHCCPL\r\nRouting code: N/A\r\nDescriptor code: N/A", "IXCH0519E": " The Sysplex Failure Management (SFM) policy specification for the action to be taken if one or\r\nmore systems lose signaling connectivity is not consistent with thecheckowner_or_installation\r\nrecommendation.\r\nExplanation: CHECK(IBMXCF,XCF_SFM_CONNFAIL) found an exception.\r\nThe SFM policy specifiespolicyspec.

REPLY DOWN AFTER SYSTEM RESET OR INTERVAL=SSSSS TO SET A REPROMPT TIME.\r\nExplanation: XCF determined that a system in the sysplex appears to be inoperative. The operator may choose to\r\nremove the system from the sysplex, or may specify a time interval to defer removal of the system.\r\nIf the system is to be removed from the sysplex, then the system must be system reset before the operator replies\r\nDOWN to this message.\r\nNote:\r\n1. The system reset is needed to ensure that the system image being removed from the sysplex no longer has the\r\ncapability to perform I/O to devices which may be shared with other systems that remain active in the sysplex. If\r\nthis reset is not performed before replying to this message, then severe data integrity problems may result. When\r\nthe subject system is removed from the sysplex, XCF will clean up resources (such as locks, ENQs, and reserves)\r\nwhich are held by that system, and make them available to other systems in the sysplex. If the subject system is\r\nin fact still active, and operating in the belief that it still holds these resources, unpredictable results may occur.\r\n2. When this message appears, it is important that the appropriate system reset action be taken, and that this\r\nmessage be replied to in a timely fashion. While this message is outstanding, XCF must still consider the subject\r\nsystem to be (at least potentially) active in the sysplex, and therefore XCF cannot clean up resources (such as\r\nlocks, ENQs, and reserves) which are held by that system. These resources will remain unavailable to all other\r\nsystems in the sysplex until this message is replied to, and the system completes the process of being removed\r\nfrom the sysplex. Extended unavailability of these resources is likely to cause delays, timeouts, or other problems\r\nfor the other systems in the sysplex.\r\nIn the message text:\r\nsysname\r\nThe name of the inoperative system in the sysplex.\r\nhh:mm:ss\r\nThe last time XCF could detect that the system was functioning. The time is in hours (00-23), minutes (00-59),\r\nand seconds (00-59).\r\nSystem action: Processing continues. If the operator performs a system reset for system sysname and then replies\r\nDOWN, XCF starts removing system sysname from the sysplex. The system is not removed from the sysplex until the\r\noperator performs a system reset and replies DOWN. If the system once again appears to be operative, the message\r\nwill be deleted before it is answere.\r\nOperator response: Choose one of the following replies:\r\nDOWN\r\nTo specify that XCF remove system sysname from the sysplex. Before replying DOWN, a system reset must be\r\nperformed on system sysname . Perform the hardware SYSTEM RESET or LOAD (IPL) function to ensure that\r\nsystem sysname is reset. If system sysname is to be dumped (for example, via Standalone Dump), take care to\r\nperform a SYSTEM-RESET-NORMAL or LOAD-NORMAL function that does not clear the system storage. Once\r\nsystem sysname is system reset, reply DOWN.\r\nNote that several acceptable alternatives to SYSTEM RESET or LOAD exist. You may replyDOWNafter any\r\naction or condition listed below occurs for system sysname :\r\nv SYSTEM RESET-NORMAL\r\nv LOAD-NORMAL\r\nv INITIATION OF STANDALONE DUMP (via LOAD-NORMAL)\r\nv SYSTEM RESET-CLEAR\r\nv LOAD-CLEAR\r\nv POWER-ON-RESET\r\nv NO POWER to the CPC where systemsysname resides\r\nv Deactivation of the Logical Partition where system sysname resides\r\nv Reset of the Logical Partition where system sysname resides\r\nv Processor on which sysname is running is in a checkstopped state.\r\nNote: Some of these system-reset alternatives might cause the issuance of messages on remote systems that are\r\nconnected by the Ficon channel to channel connections to the target system.\r\nDepending on your hardware and your hardware operational procedures, the above functions may be invoked\r\nexplicitly or implicitly. For example, on an HMC you may implicitly perform one of the above hardware\r\nfunctions by dragging a CPC object or an image object and dropping the object on the ACTIVATE task. The\r\nhardware function performed depends on the activation profile associated with the object.\r\nIt is important to note that, if system sysname is in a disabled wait state, that is not, by itself, sufficient to\r\nguarantee that system sysname can no longer access I/O devices which may be shared with other active systems\r\nin the sysplex. However, if the system is configured so that a system reset is automatically performed when a\r\ndisabled wait state is entered, then that is sufficient, and there is no need to manually reset the system again.\r\nINTERVAL=sssss\r\nTo request that system monitoring continue and the operator be reprompted, if systemsysname does not become\r\nactive within the specified interval. The interval, sssss , must be in seconds and in the range of 0 to 86400 seconds\r\n(24 hours).\r\nIf the reply is incorrect, the system issues message IXC208I to notify the operator of the error.

Structure allocation is prevented in the specified\r\ncoupling facility.\r\nDUPLEXING REBUILD NOT ALLOWED FOR THE STRUCTURE\r\nThe structure does not support duplexing rebuild for one of the following reasons:\r\nv DUPLEX(DISABLED) was specified or defaulted to in the CFRM active policy for the structure.\r\nv There are failed persistent connections that are unavailable until a larger CFRM couple data set is made\r\navailable.\r\nv A user-managed duplexing rebuild could not be started because:\r\n\u2013 User-managed duplexing rebuilds are not supported for the structure type.\r\n\u2013 At least one active or failed-persistent connection specified or defaulted to IXLCONN\r\nALLOWDUPREBLD=NO.\r\nv A system-managed duplexing rebuild could not be started because:\r\n\u2013 The structure has at least one active connector, and none of the connectors (active or failed-persistent)\r\nspecified IXLCONN ALLOWAUTO=YES when connecting.\r\n\u2013 A system-managed duplexing rebuild is not supported when a CFRM policy change is pending for the\r\nstructure.\r\nTYPE OF STOP REQUEST DOES NOT MATCH TYPE OF REBUILD IN PROGRESS\r\nEither SETXCF STOP,REBUILD was requested to stop a duplexing rebuild or SETXCF\r\nSTOP,REBUILD,DUPLEX was requested to stop a non-duplexing rebuild. The SETXCF STOP,REBUILD\r\ncommand must be used to stop non-duplexing rebuilds and the SETXCF STOP,REBUILD,DUPLEX command\r\nmust be used to stop duplexing rebuilds.\r\nDUPLEXING NOT ESTABLISHED, CANNOT STOP TO KEEP NEW STRUCTURE\r\nSETXCF STOP,REBUILD,DUPLEX,KEEP=NEW was requested and the rebuild has not yet entered the\r\nduplex established phase. Stop requests to switch to the new structure are not excepted until the rebuild\r\nenters the duplex established phase.\r\nSTRUCTURE HAS FAILED.\r\nThe rebuild start request was rejected for one of the following reasons:\r\nv SETXCF START,REBUILD,DUPLEX was requested and the structure has failed. Duplexing rebuild is not\r\nallowed when the structure is in the failed state.\r\nv The rebuild start request would result in a system-managed rebuild. System-managed rebuild is not\r\nallowed when the structure is in the failed state.\r\nNO OTHER COUPLING FACILITY FOUND IN PREFERENCE LIST.\r\nSETXCF START,REBUILD was requested and LOCATION=OTHER was either specified on the rebuild\r\nrequest or defaulted to for STARTREASON=LOSSCONN or for a request to start a duplexing rebuild. In\r\naddition to avoiding the facility in which the structure is currently allocated, when a duplexing rebuild is\r\nstopped by the operator and DUPLEX(ENABLED) is specified in the active policy, the subsequent duplexing\r\nrequest initiated due to DUPLEX(ENABLED) will avoid the coupling facility in which the previous instance\r\nof the structure was allocated when the duplexing rebuild was stopped.\r\nALREADY STOPPING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION\r\nThe IXLREBLD STOP DUPLEX request was not processed because duplex rebuild stop has already been\r\ninitiated for this structure name in the other direction. Either KEEP=OLD was requested and KEEP=NEW\r\ntype of duplex rebuild stop is in progress or KEEP=NEW was requested and KEEP=OLD type of duplex\r\nrebuild stop is in progress.\r\nSTRUCTURE DOES NOT SUPPORT SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESSES\r\nThe structure does not support system-managed processes (for example, rebuild) for one of the following\r\nreasons:\r\nv The structure was not allocated in a coupling facility at or above the minimum CFLEVEL required for the\r\ncurrent process by a system supporting system-managed processing.\r\nv The structure has connections that have not been reconciled into the CFRM active policy.\r\nv Structure cleanup is in progress for the structure.\r\nCONNECTORS DO NOT SUPPORT SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESSES\r\nThe requested system-managed process cannot be initiated for one of the following reasons:\r\nv The structure has at least one active connector, and at least one of the connectors (active or\r\nfailed-persistent) did not specify IXLCONN ALLOWAUTO=YES when connecting.\r\nv A duplexing rebuild cannot be initiated for a structure that has only failed-persistent connectors, and at\r\nleast one of the failed-persistent connectors did not specify IXLCONN ALLOWAUTO=YES when\r\nconnecting.\r\nNO SUITABLE COUPLING FACILITY IN PREFERENCE LIST\r\nThe requested system-managed process cannot be initiated for one or more of the following reasons:\r\nv The preference list is empty.\r\nv The preference list contains no other coupling facility at or above the minimum CFLEVEL required for the\r\ncurrent process.\r\nv The structure already exists in the only suitable coupling facility. The same coupling facility can only be\r\nselected as the target for the system-managed process if a CFRM policy change is pending for the\r\nstructure and one of the following is true:\r\n\u2013 The policy change does not affect the SIZE or INITSIZE parameters.\r\n\u2013 The policy change affects the SIZE or the INITSIZE parameter and all of the structure connectors\r\nspecified IXLCONN ALLOWALTER=YES.\r\nv A potentially suitable coupling facility does not permit structure allocation.\r\nAT LEAST ONE CONNECTOR HAS LOST CONNECTIVITY TO THE STRUCTURE\r\nThe requested system-managed process (for example, rebuild) cannot be initiated because one or more of the\r\nconnectors has lost connectivity to the target structure.\r\nCFRM COUPLE DATA SET DOES NOT SUPPORT SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESS\r\nThe CFRM couple data set does not support the requested system-managed process (for example, rebuild),\r\nbecause the CFRM couple data set was not formatted at or above the minimum version for the\r\nsystem-managed process requested. Use the DISPLAY XCF,COUPLE,TYPE=CFRM command to determine\r\nthe format of the CFRM couple data set. To support system-managed rebuild, the CFRM couple data set\r\nshould be formatted specifying \u201cITEM NAME(SMREBLD) NUMBER(1)\u201d. For system-managed duplexing\r\nrebuild, \u201cITEM NAME(SMDUPLEX) NUMBER(1)\u201d should also be specified when formatting a CFRM couple\r\ndata set. Specifying \u201cITEM NAME(SMDUPLEX) NUMBER(1)\u201d implicitly formats a CFRM couple data set\r\nthat supports both system-managed rebuild and system-managed duplexing rebuild.\r\nSTRUCTURE WITH NO CONNECTORS HAS NEVER BEEN SYSTEM-MANAGED DUPLEXED\r\nA system-managed duplexing rebuild cannot be initiated because there are no connections to the structure\r\nand the structure has not previously been duplexed using system-managed processing.\r\nALLOCATION OF REBUILD NEW STRUCTURE FOR DUPLEXING REBUILD NOT FEASIBLE\r\nAllocation of the rebuild new structure instance in support of a duplexing rebuild is not feasible. Message IXC574I contains additional diagnostic information.\r\nSTRUCTURE OBJECTS IN STORAGE-CLASS MEMORY\r\nThe duplexing rebuild could not be started because structure objects are currently residing in storage-class\r\nmemory.\r\nSystem action: The system ignores the command.\r\nOperator response: Use the DISPLAY XCF command with the STRUCTURE or CF options to verify the name and\r\nstate of the structure to be rebuilt. If the reason for refusing the rebuild is a perceived degradation in connectivity\r\nand this is acceptable, issue a SETXCF START,REBUILD command specifying LESSCONN=CONTINUE.\r\nLESSCONN=CONTINUE can be used to initiate a rebuild that will force the rebuild to continue despite this\r\ncondition. Because this action might cause active connections to the structure to lose connectivity to the structure, do\r\nnot use LESSCONN=CONTINUE unless you understand the impact on the application or subsystem. Some\r\nconnectors will stop the rebuild if a loss of connectivity is observed but most will disconnect from the structure to\r\nallow the rebuild to complete. Depending on the exploiter, disconnecting from the structure is likely to result in\r\nlosing the exploiter's sysplex-related functionality on that system (for example, loss of data sharing capability) and\r\nfor critical system exploiters. This might result in a system wait state. Before proceeding with this action, consult the\r\ndocumentation for the exploiting application or subsystem.\r\nSystem programmer response: Not applicable.\r\nSource: Cross System Coupling Facility (SCXCF)\r\nModule: IXCO1SCP\r\nRouting code: #\r\nDescriptor code: 5", "IXC548I": " CFRM EVENT MANAGEMENT ENVIRONMENT UPDATEDEVENT MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL: {MESSAGE-BASED|POLICY-BASED}REASON FOR CHANGE:trigger TRANSITION SEQUENCE NUMBER: transeqnum TRANSITION TIME: trantime [MANAGER SYSTEM NAME: sysname ][MANAGER SYSTEM NUMBER: sysid][MANAGEMENT LEVEL: msgbasedlevel]\r\nExplanation: The CFRM event processing environment has been updated.

The message may appear for the alternate couple\r\ndata set because of an error with the data set or because the SETXCF command with the ACOUPLE keyword was\r\nentered by the operator, causing the alternate couple data set to be replaced.\r\nThe presence of couple data set information in the display output does not necessarily imply that the system can\r\naccess the couple data set. A couple data set may be physically inaccessible (such as no paths to it available from the\r\ndisplaying system), but the system does not become aware of the problem until an attempt is made to perform I/O\r\nto the data set. The frequency of I/O varies with couple data set type. The sysplex couple data set is updated every\r\nfew seconds, but functional couple data sets may be accessed only infrequently. For example, some types of\r\nfunctional couple data sets are only accessed when a new policy is started.\r\nIn the message text:\r\nhh.mm.ss\r\nThe time in hours (00-23), minutes (00-59), and seconds (00-59) for the DISPLAY XCF command.\r\nsysname\r\nThe name of the system that issued the command\r\ninterval\r\nThe system failure detection interval in seconds.

SFM actions could include terminating the stalled\r\nmember or removing a system from the sysplex.\r\ncfstrhangtime\r\nThe CFSTRHANGTIME value as specified in the current SFM policy, which determines whether and when the\r\nsystem is to take action against a coupling facility structure connector that has not provided an expected\r\nresponse to an event associated with an on-going structure-related activity, such as rebuild. The value and\r\nmeaning are as follows:\r\nv NO indicates that the system will not take action.\r\nv N/A indicates that an SFM policy is not active on the system from which the DISPLAY command is issued, in\r\nwhich case the system behaves as if NO is specified.\r\nv An integer value indicates the number of seconds that the system is to permit the response to remain\r\noutstanding after a hang has been reported by message IXL040E or IXL041E. If the response is still\r\noutstanding when the specified interval elapses, the system will initiate corrective actions to alleviate the hang.\r\nThese may include stopping a rebuild, or terminating the task, address space, or system associated with the\r\nunresponsive connector.\r\nufdisrc\r\nThe source of the INTERVAL value being used by the system:\r\nSETXCF\r\nThe value is set by the SETXCF COUPLE,INTERVAL command.\r\nPARMLIB\r\nThe value is explicitly set in the COUPLExx parmlib member during IPL.\r\nDEFAULT\r\nThe default value that is derived from the excessive spin parameters that are currently defined for the\r\nsystem.

This value equals (N+1)*SpinTime+5where N\r\nis the number of excessive spin recovery actions, +1 indicates the implicit SPIN action, and SpinTimeis the\r\nexcessive spin loop timeout interval.\r\nuonisrc\r\nThe source of the OPNOTIFY value used by the system:\r\nSETXCF\r\nThe value is set by the SETXCF COUPLE,OPNOTIFY command.\r\nPARMLIB\r\nThe value is explicitly set in the COUPLExx parmlib member during IPL.\r\nDEFAULT\r\nThe default OPNOTIFY value is a relative value of three seconds. Thus the effective OPNOTIFY value\r\nused for this system is three seconds more than the effective failure detection interval value\r\n(INTERVAL), but not more than the maximum value of 86400.\r\n[+]ooooo\r\nThe OPNOTIFY value specified by the user, whether explicitly or by default. The value is displayed as +ooooo for\r\na relative OPNOTIFY value, ooooo for an absolute OPNOTIFY value.\r\nmaxcflevel\r\nThe maximum CFLEVEL supported by this system.\r\nmaxprocesslevel\r\nThe maximum level of system-managed process, if any, supported by the system.

If the value is not\r\nthe current system default, it will be reset to the system default. If the system default is not appropriate for\r\nuse, issue the SETXCF MODIFY,SYNCASYNC command to set an appropriate value.\r\ndefthresh\r\nThe default sync/async conversion threshold value that would have been used if the system-determined default\r\nvalue was in effect.

You can compute\r\nxxxx: It is the value found in S99ERSN, converted to decimal. The documenation for this IGDxxxx message gives the\r\nmeaning of the value found in S99ERSN, even if the DFSMS message does not appear in syslog. Not all values of\r\nS99ERSN map to an IGDxxxx message. Here are some examples of S99ERSN values and the related message ID: If\r\nS99ERSN is x'00042CF', the DFSMS message ID is IGD17103.

Message IXC307I is\r\nissued upon successful completion of the preempting unconditional stop request.\r\nIn the case of an unexpected error, the path may or may not have been stopped successfully. If not, the state of the\r\npath is unpredictable.\r\nIf the signalling path is no longer in use, no further action is needed.\r\nIf the stop was performed despite the failure, the system was able to complete the request. However, resources may\r\nstill be associated with the signalling path. Although stop processing completed, it is considered unsuccessful because\r\nthese resources were not released. For shared resources, other systems in the sysplex may release the resources. For\r\nlocal resources, the system continues to monitor the associated resources and releases them when they are no longer\r\nin use. For operator initiated stop requests, the path is no longer defined to XCF for signalling in the indicated\r\ndirection. For system initiated stop requests, the path remains defined to XCF, and may be started anew\r\nautomatically as a result of various events or circumstances.\r\nFor other failures, the signalling path is left in a STOPFAILED state.

If the\r\nsignalling path is not listed in the display output, it has been removed from service and no further action is\r\nneeded.\r\nIf the signalling path status displayed by message IXC356I indicates STOPPING, allow additional time for the\r\nstop to complete. Completion of the stop could be delayed if the system to which the stopping path is connected\r\nis non-operational, or if signalling connectivity with that system has been lost. If needed, use the SETXCF START\r\npath command to start additional signalling paths to establish signalling connectivity or use the VARY XCF\r\ncommand to remove the non-operational system from the sysplex. Alternatively, enter a SETXCF STOP path\r\ncommand specifying UNCOND=YES to force completion of stop processing for the STOPPING path.\r\nIf the signalling path status displayed by message IXC356I indicates STOPFAILED, enter a SETXCF STOP\r\ncommand to try stopping the path again. Note that for a list path, the SETXCF STOP command can only be\r\napplied to the structure as a whole, so the stop command should be issued only if the intent is to stop the\r\nsystem from using the structure for signalling in the indicated direction.\r\nFor any other signalling path status, no action is needed.\r\nAN UNEXPECTED ERROR OCCURRED\r\nEnter a DISPLAY XCF path command to obtain detailed information for the signalling path.

If a transport class does not have an operational\r\noutbound signaling path to communicate with a particular target system, the signals using that transport class are\r\nrerouted over a signal path from some other transport class. This means that the desired segregation of message\r\ntraffic is not obtained.\r\nMessages routed to an alternate signaling path incur additional overhead and can degrade the performance of\r\nmessages that are supposed to use the alternate class. The consequences can be particularly severe if the buffer size\r\nused by the alternate class is smaller than the buffer size used by the rerouted message. In such cases, XCF may have\r\nto send additional control signals to change the size of the inbound message buffers on the target system. Since the\r\nnumber of buffers in a bufferpool gets smaller when the buffers are bigger, signal capacity is reduced. If the target\r\nsystem thereby experiences \"no buffer\" conditions, signal throughput will be impacted.\r\nTo avoid the consequences of this lack of segregation, assigning at least one signaling path to the transport class for\r\neach possible target system. For capacity and availability, additional paths may bedesired. The check parameter\r\ndetermines the minimum number of signaling paths required per transport class per system.\r\nSystem action: The system continues processing.\r\nOperator response: Report this problem to the system programmer.\r\nSystem programmer response: A particular transport class might not have enough operational signaling paths for a\r\nparticular target system because there are too few paths assigned to the transport class, or because some of the\r\nassigned paths were not operational at the time of the check. If there are toofew paths assigned to the class, you must\r\neither start more outbound signaling paths (ensuring that they are assigned to this transport class), or modify\r\nexisting signaling paths to change them from one transport class to another. If the signaling paths were not\r\noperational, determine the cause, make repairs as needed, and restorethe paths to service.\r\nProblem determination: N/A\r\nSource: Parallel Sysplex (XCF)\r\nModule: IXCHCSIG\r\nRouting code: See note 35.\r\nDescriptor code: 3 is the default set by this check.

At the direction of the system\r\nprogrammer, you may need to obtain dumps for problem diagnosis and/or terminate the indicated application.\r\nXCF monitors its own internal use of the XCF signalling service and may issue message IXC431I if XCF itself appears\r\nto be stalled.

To accomplish the\r\nmember termination, the system on which the member resides may be removed from the sysplex.\r\nv If the message indicates that SFM will take action, then XCF will delay taking action until the indicated time. If\r\nthe stall condition persists and continues to impact the sysplex, XCF will then terminate the stalled member(s). If\r\nXCF terminates the stalled member, XCF will initiate a dump, and issue message IXC615I to indicate that action is\r\nbeing taken against the stalled member to resolve the problem.\r\nIf the stalled member(s) resumes normal operation or the sysplex is no longer impacted by the stall condition,\r\nmessage IXC632I is issued.\r\nFor an impaired member condition system sysname issues message IXC633I for each impaired member contributing to\r\nthe problem.\r\nv If message IXC640E indicates that SFM is taking action, XCF terminates the impaired member(s).

However, the operator might choose to investigate and remedy the problem if there is enough\r\ntime to do so before SFM takes action. Before SFM takes action, the SETXCF command can be used to stop or change\r\nthe SFM policy to provide additional time for manual action.\r\nIf manual intervention is required, the operator should investigate and resolve the problem. If the message indicates\r\nthat the condition is being ignored because the impacted systems are being removed from the sysplex, the operator\r\ncan optionally investigate and resolve the problem. Use DISPLAY XCF,GROUP, grp_name,member_name to get detailed\r\ninformation about the stalled member. Message IXC333I provides status information about the member and indicates\r\nwhat work appears to be stalled.\r\nThere may be other commands provided by the indicated application/subsystem that will allow you to determine its\r\nstatus and/or alleviate the problem. If more than one member is impacted, there may be an underlying system\r\nproblem affecting them all. If so, investigate the status of the system at large. At the direction of the system\r\nprogrammer, you may need to obtain dumps for problem diagnosis and/or terminate the indicated application.\r\nXCF monitors its own internal use of the XCF signalling service and may issue message IXC431I if XCF itself appears\r\nto be stalled. However, the DISPLAY XCF,GROUP command cannot be used to investigate such stalls since the\r\ncommand does not support the internal XCF group.\r\nMessage IXC440E is issued by each system in the sysplex that is impacted by the stall condition. These messages can\r\nbe used to judge the pervasiveness of the impact.\r\nSystem programmer response: Check the status of the indicated application/subsystem. If multiple members\r\nappear to be stalled, or if other indicators suggest work is not being processed, there may be an underlying problem\r\naffecting them all. If so, a broader system diagnosis may be warranted since the impacted members may not be at\r\nfault. On many occasions the system will successfully resolve the situation during the course of normal processing, in\r\nwhich case no further action is warranted. If necessary, take appropriate action to correct the situation or\r\ncancel/terminate the application.\r\nTake the following steps:\r\n1. Issue the DISPLAY XCF,GROUP,grp_name,ALL and any relevant application display.\r\n2. Collect the following diagnostic information: system log, application log, and an appropriate dump. In addition to\r\napplication specific diagnostic data, the dump should include XCF data (SDATA=COUPLE).\r\n3.

REASON FLAG: reason.\r\nThe coupling facility is defined in the CFRM active policy but the system does not have connectivity. The\r\ncoupling facility cannot be used by this system. For a system to establish connectivity to a coupling facility, the\r\nCFRM active policy definition of the coupling facility must identify a usable coupling facility. The possible\r\nreasons for the system not having connectivity are as follows:\r\nv The coupling facility not having enough CPU resource available\r\nCheck that the coupling facility has enough CPU resource available so that the system can establish\r\nconnectivity. A lack of CPU resources can result in commands to the coupling facility timing out, which\r\nprevents the system from connecting.\r\nv A mismatch between the IODF specification of the coupling facility and the CFRM active policy definition of\r\nthe coupling facility\r\nThe node descriptor is used to identify the coupling facility.\r\nv Problems with the coupling facility links\r\nCheck that the coupling facility links are properly configured online.

Use an existing administrative policy or define a new\r\nadministrative policy using the XCF administrative policy utility (IXCMIAPU) and issue the SETXCF\r\nSTART,POLICY,TYPE=CFRM,POLNAME=polname operator command or specify CFRMPOL(polname) keyword\r\nin the COUPLExx parmlib member, which is used to IPL the system.\r\nSystem action: The CFRM active policy is updated to reflect the current state of the coupling facility.\r\nWhen the system lost connectivity to the coupling facility, message IXC568I will be issued to indicate what is being\r\ndone to recover.\r\nOperator response: Notify the system programmer.\r\nSystem programmer response: Determine that the CFRM active policy and the configuration of the coupling facility\r\nare correct, and both of them properly identify the same coupling facility. If a CFRM policy change is required, use\r\nthe XCF administrative data utility (IXCMIAPU) to define the policy and start the CFRM administrative policy either\r\nby issuing the SETXCF START,POLICY,TYPE=CFRM,POLNAME=polname operator command or by specifying\r\nCFRMPOL(polname) in the COUPLExx parmlib member, which is used to IPL the system.\r\nThe CFRMPOL(polname) option is only applicable if there is no other previously-activated CFRM policy in effect. By\r\nspecifying a CFRM policy to be started at IPL-time, you can initialize your sysplex in the global resource serialization\r\nstar mode when there is no previously-activated CFRM policy, if the CFRM policy started contains the ISGLOCK\r\nstructure, which is required for the GRS star mode.\r\nIf the message text includes one of the following inserts, the system that issues the message may end up being\r\nconnected to the coupling facility without being able to use it:\r\nv OPERATOR REPLIED NO TO IXC501A OR IXC560A\r\nv ERROR IN GAIN OWNERSHIP PROCESS\r\nWhen a system is connected to a coupling facility without using it, determine whether or not the system should be\r\nconnected to the coupling facility.

If a data set\r\nfalls above this bound, the data set will be reallocated to around 3.5G.\r\nIn the message text:\r\ndssize\r\nOne of the following:\r\n64K The approximate size of the newly allocated data set because the originally specified dataset was too\r\nsmall.\r\n3.5G The approximate size of the newly allocated data set because the originally specified data set was too\r\nlarge. Logger tries to get a data set around 3.5G and specifies 917504 4K bytes as the corresponding\r\nLS_SIZE or STG_SIZE attribute.\r\ndsname\r\nThe name of the data set.\r\nSystem action: The data set is allocated using a valid size in the range noted in the message text.\r\nOperator response: None.\r\nSystem programmer response: The incorrect size was either specified in a DFSMS data class or on a log stream\r\nattribute at DEFINE time. Search for messages IEF196I and IGD101I that may have been recorded in syslog when the\r\ndata set was newly allocated and check the assigned attributes.\r\nSee the LS_SIZE, LS_DATACLAS, STG_SIZE and the STG_DATACLAS specifications for the logstream definition and\r\nthe DFSMS data class that is being used. The appropriate specification should be changed to meet the minimum data\r\nset size requirement for system logger.

The SPINRCVY statement and the SPINTIME keyword in the EXSPATxx\r\nparmlib member determine the number of spin actions and the spin loop timeout, respectively. If the excessive\r\nspin parameters are not explicitly set on an EXSPATxx parmlib member, the IBM supplied default spin\r\nparameters are used.

No more data set directory extent records are available\r\nThis means that all of the data set directory extent records for the TEST group are in use in the active primary\r\nLOGR CDS. System logger will fail log stream offloads in the TEST group since it is unable to obtain a data set\r\ndirectory extent required to process an offload. If the condition persists, then the log stream writers may\r\neventually receive \"log stream interim storage full\" error conditions.\r\nOperator response: Notify the system programmer.\r\nSystem programmer response: The pool of available data set directory extent records in the active primary LOGR\r\nCDS may need to be increased.\r\n1. Freeing data set directory extents from existing log streams:\r\nYou can relieve the shortage by freeing data set directory extent records being consumed by existing log stream\r\ndefinitions. Run a report of the log streams defined in the LOGR couple data set to help you identify candidates\r\nfor cleanup. The report utility program is IXCMIAPU for DATA TYPE(LOGR) using the LIST LOGSTREAM\r\nNAME(*) DETAIL(YES) request. Data set directory extent records can be freed in two different ways:\r\na. Deleting log stream definitions.\r\nIf you can identify unnecessary log stream definitions that are consuming data set directory extents, deleting\r\nthe log stream definition will result in the data set directory extent records associated with that log stream\r\nbeing freed and put back into the available pool. As an aid in detecting unnecessary log stream definitions,\r\ncheck the log stream GROUP attribute. It is more likely you will want to delete TEST log streams before you\r\ndelete PRODUCTION log streams.\r\nb. Reducing the retention period for log data.\r\nIf you can identify log streams that are defined with excessive retention periods and these log streams are\r\nconsuming data set directory extent records, by reducing the retention period you may free up data set\r\ndirectory extent records, thus increasing the available pool. For TEST group based log streams, you may want\r\nto make the retention period small so that the log data can be quickly deleted thus occupying less data set\r\ndirectory extent records.\r\nNote: System logger does not necessarily react immediately to reductions in the retention period. The rule for\r\nwhen system logger will process reductions in the retention period is on the next data set switch event for the\r\nlog stream. Hence, this implies that the log stream must be connected and incurring sufficient write activity to\r\nforce data set switch events.\r\n2. Bring in a new primary LOGR couple data set with more data set directory extent records:\r\nYou can format a new LOGR couple data set and increase the number of data set directory extent records through\r\nthe DSEXTENT keyword on the couple data set format utility.

The\r\nsystem issues system logger message IXG068D to allow the installation to confirm that system logger should identify\r\nand convert any DRXRC-type resources. That is, system logger will make existing DRXRC-type staging data sets\r\navailable for log stream recovery, and any log streams with STG_DUPLEX(YES),DUPLEXMODE(DRXRC) currently\r\nspecified will be converted to STG_DUPLEX(NO).\r\nIt is assumed the necessary actions, (e.g. XRC XEND and XRECOVER commands) have been taken to establish the\r\nDASD consistency groups related to the system logger data sets before this recovery system being IPLed with\r\nDRMODE=YES.\r\nFollowing this message confirmation, system logger messages IXG072I, IXG224I and IXG069I will be issued when\r\nsystem logger has taken action to include the appropriate log stream DRXRC-type resources in log stream data\r\nrecovery.

Following this response, system logger messages, such as IXG072I, IXG224I and IXG069I, will be issued when system logger has taken action to include the appropriate log stream\r\nDRXRC-type staging data sets in log data recovery.\r\nN To request that system logger initialization continue and requests system logger to NOT convert\r\nDRXRC-type staging data sets for log stream recovery at this time.\r\nFor log streams using DRXRC-type staging data sets, the N reply will be treated by system logger as if the\r\nsystem were IPLed with DRMODE=NO.

If the structure still\r\ncannot be allocated, this process is repeated until there are so few lists that the structure would not be suitable for\r\nsignalling even if it could be allocated. The system issues message(s) IXC463I for the maximum number of lists\r\nrequested, and for the number of lists requested at the point the system deemed that the structure would not be\r\nsuitable for signalling. The system issues message IXC457I if the structure can be allocated during this process.\r\nIf the structure is not successfully allocated for the REBUILD case, the system will revert to the original structure if it\r\nis still usable and will initiate a stop path request if it is not usable. The system also initiates a stop path request if\r\nthe structure cannot be allocated when it is not a REBUILD case.\r\nSystem programmer response: Use this information to determine why a structure was not allocated in a particular\r\ncoupling facility.\r\nEnsure that the coupling facility supports the structure attributes required for it to be used by XCF. As needed, make\r\na suitable coupling facility available to the sysplex.\r\nEnsure that the correct CFRM policy is active. As needed, modify the definition of the structure in the CFRM active\r\npolicy. For example, change the maximum structure size, the preference list, or the exclusion list. Also consider\r\nmodifying the CFRM active policy for other structures since reducing the size or number of structures allocated in a\r\ncoupling facility could free up space for this structure.\r\nSource: Cross System Coupling Facility (SCXCF)\r\nModule: IXCT1ISS\r\nRouting code: 1, 2\r\nDescriptor code: 5,12", "IXG074I": " SYSTEM LOGGER SERVICES DISABLED FOR GROUP: TEST\r\nExplanation: The system logger TEST group service tasks failed.

Message IXC454I identifies the systems without signalling connectivity to the IPLing system.\r\nIn the message text:\r\nR TO REINITIALIZE XCF\r\nSince the system is not yet active in the sysplex, XCF can be re-initialized.\r\nRE-IPL SYSTEM\r\nSince the system is active in the sysplex, XCF cannot be re-initialized. The system must be removed from the\r\nsysplex and re-initialized via an IPL.\r\nSystem action: Initialization processing stops until the operator replies to the message or re-IPLs the system.\r\nOperator response: There are six diagnostic activities to guide you in replying to this message. Before doing any of\r\nthese activities, do a visual check on all hardware systems and compare with the configuration chart to ensure that\r\nall systems are correctly configured. If the configuration is correct, do the following to diagnose the problem:\r\n1. Check the COUPLExx parmlib member and the couple data set\r\n2. Check for non-operational systems\r\n3. Check the signalling path definitions\r\n4. Check the signalling path status in each active system\r\n5. Check the signalling path status in the IPLing system\r\n6. Collect diagnostic data for IBM.\r\nThese diagnostic procedures are described in greater detail below. After diagnosing the problem, choose one of the\r\npossible responses indicated in the message:\r\nINTERVAL=nnn\r\nTo request that the IPLing system continue to check for full connectivity in the sysplex for the next nnn seconds.\r\nChoose this response after resolving any diagnosed problems, or simply to allow more time for the signalling\r\npaths to become established.\r\nEach time this response is chosen, stopped signalling paths on the IPLing system are started again since the\r\ncircumstances which caused the path failure may have been resolved, thereby allowing the path to establish\r\nsignalling connectivity. In some cases, the system will unconditionally stop paths that are in the midst of stop\r\nprocessing so that a new start request can be initiated for the path.\r\nSystem initialization proceeds as soon as signalling connectivity is established. If connectivity is not established\r\nwithin nnn seconds, the system reissues message IXC455D to reprompt the operator. The maximum allowable\r\nvalue of nnn is 999 seconds.\r\nR To request reinitialization of XCF. Choose this response if the signalling path definitions in the current\r\nCOUPLExx do not provide the required signalling paths for the systems identified in message IXC454I.\r\nChoose this response to stop and then start the signalling paths all over again (specify the same COUPLExx\r\nparmlib member when prompted). This action sometimes allows signalling connectivity to be established when\r\nthe system does not seem to be making progress despite repeated use of the INTERVAL= nnn response.\r\nThe system issues message IXC207A to prompt the operator to specify a new COUPLExx member. All signalling\r\npaths are stopped, and the system starts the signalling paths identified in the new COUPLExx parmlib member.\r\nDuring XCF initialization, message IXC305I may or may not be displayed on an operator console when a CTC\r\ndevice cannot be started as a signalling path.\r\nv The message is not displayed on an operator console the first time XCF initialization runs during an IPL.\r\nv If XCF initialization is to be restarted for an issue not related to signalling connectivity problems, the message\r\nis not displayed on an operator console.\r\nv If XCF initialization is to be restarted for an issue related to signalling connectivity, message IXC207A prompts\r\nthe operator to respecify the COUPLExx parmlib member. The response to message IXC207A determines\r\nwhether message IXC305I is displayed on an operator console. If the same COUPLExx parmlib member is\r\nspecified, message IXC305I will be displayed. If a different COUPLExx parmlib member is specified, message IXC305I will not be displayed on the operator console, but IXC305I will always be displayed on the hardcopy log.\r\nRe-IPL the system\r\nIt may not be possible for XCF to process a new COUPLExx member. In this case, the only recourse is to re-IPL\r\nthe system. From an active console in the sysplex, enter a VARY XCF command to remove this system from the\r\nsysplex. Once sysplex partitioning completes, re-IPL this system. Specify a COUPLExx parmlib member that\r\ndefines the signalling paths by which signalling connectivity can be established.\r\nIf an incorrect reply is entered, the system issues message IXC208I to notify the operator of the error. The system\r\nthen reissues message IXC455D.\r\nRepeatedly specifying INTERVAL= nnn and/or repeatedly respecifying the COUPLExx parmlib member may cause a\r\nsignalling path on another system to be stopped because the path exceeds its retry limit. In such cases the operator\r\nmay need to enter a SETXCF START path command on that system to manually start the signalling path again. This\r\nsituation is more likely to occur when the other system is running a release of MVS/ESA prior to SP510.\r\nSpecifically, the diagnostic procedures are:\r\n1. Are the COUPLExx parmlib member and couple data set identified properly?\r\nIf the COUPLExx parmlib member is not correctly identified, request reinitialization of XCF (reply R) with the\r\ncorrect parmlib member. If the sysplex couple data set is not correctly identified, request reinitialization of XCF\r\n(reply R) with the correct couple data set. The COUPLExx parmlib member identifies the sysplex couple data\r\nset(s) to be used by this system.\r\n2. Are any systems non-operational?\r\nCheck the systems named in message IXC454I. If any of these systems is non-operational, use the VARY XCF\r\ncommand from an active system to remove the non-operational systems from the sysplex. When all\r\nnon-operational systems have been removed from the sysplex, reply INTERVAL= nnn to request that the IPLing\r\nsystem continue to check for full signalling connectivity.\r\nIf there is no active system in the sysplex from which to issue the VARY XCF command, ensure that the systems\r\nnamed in message IXC454I actually are non-operational. Then, reply R to reinitialize XCF. If message IXC405D\r\nappears, reply I to complete the removal of all the systems from the sysplex and continue the initialization\r\nprocess.\r\n3. Are all signalling paths properly defined in the COUPLExx parmlib member?\r\nUse the configuration chart to verify that the required signalling paths are correctly defined in the current\r\nCOUPLExx parmlib member. If the signalling path definitions do not agree, you must either specify a different\r\nCOUPLExx member or modify the current one. See the system programmer.\r\n4. What is the status of the signalling paths in each active system?\r\nFrom an active system console, issue DISPLAY XCF,PATHOUT and DISPLAY XCF,PATHIN commands to obtain\r\ndetailed information about the status of the signalling paths on each of the systems listed in message IXC454I.\r\nThe DISPLAY command issues message IXC356I which identifies the status of the requested signalling paths. If\r\nthe status of a path needed for signalling connectivity is STARTING, RESTARTING, LINKING, REBUILDING,\r\nQUIESCING, or QUIESCED, allow additional time for XCF to establish signalling connectivity (reply\r\nINTERVAL= nnn ). If the signalling path is not established after several attempts, enter a SETXCF STOP path\r\ncommand to stop the path and then enter a SETXCF START command to start the path again.\r\nNote particularly that additional time may be needed when a list structure is used for signalling. Signalling paths\r\ncannot be established through a list structure until an active system allocates the structure and initializes it for use\r\nby the XCF signalling service. If a list structure is the only means of establishing connectivity between a set of\r\nsystems in the sysplex (not recommended since it represents a single point of failure), the first system in the set to\r\nbecome active in the sysplex will be the only system capable of allocating the structure. The remaining systems in\r\nthe set cannot allocate the structure because they are not active in the sysplex, and they cannot become active in\r\nthe sysplex until they establish signalling connectivity. Initialization of the remaining systems will be delayed\r\nuntil the first system in the set successfully starts the structure for signalling. Message IXC306I is issued when the\r\nstructure is started successfully.\r\nIf the status is STOPPING, STOPFAILED, or INOPERATIVE, do the following:\r\nv If the status is STOPPING, let the stop complete or issue the SETXCF STOP command with UNCOND=YES.\r\nOnce the path is stopped, issue the SETXCF command to start the path again.\r\nv If the status is STOPFAILED, enter SETXCF STOP path command(s) to try stopping the path again. If the\r\nfailure persists, specify the UNCOND=YES option on the stop path commands to unconditionally stop the\r\npath.\r\nv Examine the system logs to gather more information about signalling paths that are stopped or have failed to\r\nstart. Resolve any hardware problems.\r\nv Enter a SETXCF START command to start the path again.\r\nIf a needed signalling path is not displayed, enter SETXCF START path command to start the path needed to\r\nestablish signalling connectivity.\r\nAfter resolving these path problems, reply INTERVAL=nnn on the IPLing system to allow XCF additional time to\r\nestablish connectivity.\r\n5. What is the status of the signalling paths in the IPLing system?\r\nExamine the system logs from all systems for any additional data, especially messages about stopped paths or\r\npaths that failed to be started. If these messages originate from the IPLing system, and the paths needed for\r\nconnectivity are either stopped or have not been successfully started, reinitialize XCF with the COUPLExx\r\nparmlib member that corresponds to the configuration. As a last resort, take a stand-alone dump from the IPLing\r\nsystem. View the dump with the Interactive Problem Control System (IPCS). Use the VERBX MTRACE command\r\nto view messages issued to the system log during the IPL.\r\n6. If connectivity is not established at this point, what diagnostic aids does the IBM Support Center need?\r\nContact the IBM Support Center. The system programmer should provide the following information:\r\na. A copy of the configuration chart\r\nb. The console output from the DISPLAY command showing the signalling path status\r\nc. The COUPLExx parmlib definition for each system\r\nd. System logs from all systems\r\ne. An SVC dump from the active system including the XCF address space, the XCF data spaces, and LSQA.\r\nf. A stand-alone dump from the IPLing system, also containing the XCF data spaces.\r\nSystem programmer response: Provide a configuration chart for the operator which describes the signalling paths\r\nused to establish signalling connectivity between every pair of systems in the sysplex. Ensure that the COUPLExx\r\nparmlib member correctly defines the signalling paths needed to establish signalling connectivity. Ensure that the\r\nnecessary signalling paths are defined to systems already active in the sysplex. Ensure that the underlying hardware\r\n(devices, coupling facilities, coupling data sets) are operational and available to the appropriate systems. For list\r\nstructures, ensure that the appropriate CFRM policy is active. Examine the system logs to determine why signalling\r\nconnectivity could not be established.

The structure rebuild process type\r\ncould be either rebuild or duplexing rebuild. For a duplexing rebuild, the in-progress processing could be\r\none of the following:\r\nv The structure is duplexed. For a user-managed duplexing rebuild, only one instance is allocated because\r\nthe last user connected to both instances disconnected in between another user's IXLCONN and\r\nIXLCONN REBUILD requests.\r\nv Process is in progress but has not reached duplexing established.\r\nv Process has been stopped with KEEP=OLD.\r\nv Process has been stopped with KEEP=NEW.\r\nTHE STRUCTURE HAS FAILED\r\nThe rebuild start request was rejected for one of the following reasons:\r\nv The request was to start a duplexing rebuild and the structure has failed. Duplexing rebuild is not\r\nallowed when the structure is in the failed state.\r\nv The request would result in a system-managed rebuild. System-managed rebuild is not allowed when the\r\nstructure is in the failed state.\r\nTHE STRUCTURE HAS NO ACTIVE CONNECTORS\r\nThe request would have resulted in a user-managed process, but the structure has no active connectors to\r\nparticipate in structure rebuild processing.\r\nAT LEAST ONE CONNECTOR DOES NOT SUPPORT REBUILD\r\nAt least one of the active connectors to the structure does not support rebuild.\r\nNO SUITABLE COUPLING FACILITY FOR REBUILD WITH LOCATION=OTHER\r\nThe rebuild start request was rejected because LOCATION=OTHER was necessary and no other eligible\r\ncoupling facility was found in the preference list.\r\nNO COUPLING FACILITY PROVIDED BETTER OR EQUIVALENT CONNECTIVITY\r\nNo other facility has better connectivity than the current one. The rebuild would cause a degradation in\r\nconnectivity as determined by SFM system weights, if accepted.\r\nDUPLEXING REBUILD PREVENTED BY CONNECTOR(S)\r\nThe structure does not support duplexing rebuild for one of the following reasons:\r\nv There are failed persistent connections that are unavailable until a larger CFRM couple data set is made\r\navailable.\r\nv A user-managed duplexing rebuild could not be started because:\r\n\u2013 User-managed duplexing rebuilds are not supported for the structure type.\r\n\u2013 At least one active or failed-persistent connection specified or defaulted to IXLCONN\r\nALLOWDUPREBLD=NO.\r\nv A system-managed duplexing rebuild could not be started because:\r\n\u2013 The structure has at least one active connector, and none of the connectors (active or failed-persistent)\r\nspecified IXLCONN ALLOWAUTO=YES when connecting.\r\nTHE STRUCTURE DOES NOT SUPPORT SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESSES\r\nThe structure does not support system-managed processes (for example, rebuild) for one of the following\r\nreasons:\r\nv The structure was not allocated in a coupling facility at or above the minimum CFLEVEL required for the\r\ncurrent process by a system supporting system-managed processing.\r\nv The structure has connections that have not been reconciled into the CFRM active policy.\r\nv Structure cleanup is in progress for the structure.\r\nNO SUITABLE COUPLING FACILITY IN PREFERENCE LIST\r\nThe requested system-managed process cannot be initiated for one or more of the following reasons:\r\nv The preference list is empty.\r\nv The preference list contains no other coupling facility at or above the minimum CFLEVEL required for the\r\ncurrent process.\r\nv The structure already exists in the only suitable coupling facility. The same coupling facility can only be\r\nselected as the target for the system-managed rebuild if a CFRM policy change is pending, and either:\r\n\u2013 The policy changes does not involve updates to the SIZE or INITSIZE values, or\r\n\u2013 the policy change does involve updates to SIZE or INITSIZE and all the structure connectors specified\r\nIXLCONN ALLOWALTER=YES.\r\nv A potentially suitable coupling facility does not permit structure allocation.\r\nCONNECTORS DO NOT SUPPORT SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESSES\r\nThe structure has at least one active connector, and at least one of the connectors (active or failed-persistent)\r\ndid not specify IXLCONN ALLOWAUTO=YES when connecting.\r\nAT LEAST ONE CONNECTOR HAS LOST CONNECTIVITY\r\nThe requested system-managed process (for example, rebuild) cannot be initiated because one or more of the\r\nconnectors to the target structure has lost connectivity.\r\nTHE CFRM CDS DOES NOT SUPPORT SYSTEM-MANAGED PROCESS\r\nThe CFRM couple data set does not support the requested system-managed process (for example, rebuild),\r\nbecause the CFRM couple data set was not formatted at or above the minimum version for the\r\nsystem-managed process requested.

The integer size unit u specification is K (kilobytes), M (megabytes), G (gigabytes), or T\r\n(terabytes). The minimum storage required to allocate the structure in this coupling facility with the\r\nrequested attributes is initsize .\r\ninitsizesource\r\nThe source from which the initial allocation was determined. It can be one of the following:\r\nINITSIZE\r\nThe initial allocation size was determined using the INITSIZE (or SIZE if not specified) specified in\r\nthe CFRM policy. To fix the problem, increase the INITSIZE in the CFRM policy.\r\nSTRSIZE\r\nThe initial allocation size was determined using the STRSIZE specified on the IXLCONN\r\ninvocation. See message IXL013I for more details on the failing application.\r\nNote: The size unit displayed may be converted to the largest size unit that can be used to represent\r\nthe size and avoids any rounding. For example, an initsize of 1048576K may be converted to an initsize\r\nof 1G for the purpose of messages. An initsize of 120000K will not cause the displayed size to be\r\nconverted because it is not an even multiple of megabytes, gigabytes, or terabytes.\r\nEnsure that you do not define SIZE substantially larger than INITSIZE. The amount of storage needed for\r\nthe structure includes both control areas required by coupling facility control code and data areas used by\r\nthe application. When allocating the structure initially, the system attempts to build all control structures\r\nthat are required to support the maximum size of the structure.\r\nThe amount of storage required by the structure also increases as a function of the CFRM policy\r\nSCMMAXSIZE specification. Requesting a large amount of storage-class memory can significantly increase\r\nthe minimum structure size.\r\nSeveral factors determine how much storage is needed for control structures. Those factors include CFRM\r\npolicy specification, application program specification on the IXLCONN service, coupling facility storage\r\nconstraints, coupling facility storage increment and coupling facility level. See 'Requesting Structure Size' in\r\n'Setting Up a Sysplex' for a complete discussion of structure allocation.\r\nYou can use the CF Sizer tool, available on the Parallel Sysplex website http://www.ibm.com/systems/\r\nsupport/z/cfsizer/, for help in determining structure SIZE, INITSIZE, and SCMMAXSIZE attributes.\r\nINSUFFICIENT SPACE FOR space u\r\nThere was not sufficient space in the coupling facility to allocate the structure. The integer size unit u\r\nspecification is K (kilobytes), M (megabytes), G (gigabytes), or T (terabytes).\r\nThere may be enough space in the coupling facility to allocate the structure, but the allocated structure\r\nsize would be smaller than MINSIZE as specified or defaulted to in the CFRM policy. Check the size\r\nattributes (such as CONAFACILITYMINREQSIZE) returned to indicate the storage required to allocate\r\nthe structure in this coupling facility with the requested attributes. When the policy specifies\r\nSCMMAXSIZE for the affected structure, space will also include an additional component representing\r\nthe amount of storage necessary to support storage-class memory. Make sure there is a coupling facility\r\nin the preference list with sufficient space.

For a structure without any active connectors, the SFM weight of each coupling facility is the\r\nsum of the SFM weights of all systems connected to that coupling facility. For a structure with active\r\nconnectors, only systems with active connectors are used to determine the SFM weight of the coupling\r\nfacility. Note that all systems are considered to have equal SFM weight if no SFM policy is active.\r\nRESTRICTED BY OPERATOR STOP OF DUPLEXING REBUILD\r\nThe system did not select the coupling facility because the operator had previously stopped the duplexing\r\nrebuild and the structure that was not kept was allocated in this coupling facility. (Text corresponds to\r\nIXLCONN reason code CONARSNREBLDDUPLEXOTHER.)\r\nPOPULATECF NOT SUITABLE\r\nFacility was not selected because it was not as suitable a location for the structure as its current location.\r\nINSUFFICIENT CFLEVEL FOR CONNECTOR EXPLOITATION\r\nThe coupling facility CFLEVEL was not at or above the minimum required for an original connector or for\r\nthe current set of active and failed-persistent connectors.\r\ndiag\r\nAdditional diagnostic information from ConaDiag4 that can be used when a nonzero value is returned that can\r\nbe used by IBM Service Personnel in evaluating structure allocation processing. For example, this data could be\r\nhelpful in determining why a particular coupling facility was selected rather than another.
