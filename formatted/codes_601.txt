This can occur if the specified percentage is small, or if there is a small or insufficient amount of\r\navailable online storage. If xM, xG, xT,or x% syntax is specified, a percentage request is calculated by first\r\nmultiplying the percentage by the online real storage, and then subtracting 2G: (percentage * online real storage ) \u20132G.\r\nHowever, if1M=or 2G= syntax is specified, a percentage request is calculated by first subtracting 4G from the online\r\nreal storage, and then multiplying that by the percentage: ( online real storage \u2013 4G)*percentage. The result is then\r\nrounded down to the nearest respective 1 MB or 2 GB page boundary, which could result in a zero value.\r\nFor example, on a 13G system, a request for LFAREA=(2G=10%) is calculated as 0.10 * (13G \u2013 4G) = 0.9G, which\r\nrounded down to the nearest 2G page boundary becomes zero. In this example, a request for at least 23% is required\r\nto reserve at least one page, which is calculated as 0.23 * (13G \u2013 4G) = 2.07G which is then rounded down to 2G. This\r\nmessage is issued when either a nonzero target percentage or a nonzero minimum percentage results in a request for\r\nzero target or zero minimum pages.\r\nSystem action: The system issues message IAR045I for each area with the amount of available storage and the\r\nminimum percentage required for at least one page. In addition, the system responds as follows if a nonzero\r\npercentage results in a request for zero pages because of insufficient storage:\r\nv If xM, xG, xT,or x% syntax was specified, the system reserves zero 1 MB and zero 2G= pages and continues the\r\nIPL.\r\nv If 1M= or 2G= syntax was specified:\r\n\u2013 If PROMPT was specified, either explicitly or by default, the system prompts for reentry of the LFAREA\r\nparameter.\r\n\u2013 If NOPROMPT was specified, the LFAREA specification is ignored and zero 1 MB or 2 GB pages are reserved in\r\nthe large frame area and IPL continues.\r\nOperator response: Ensure that the correct IEASYSxx member is used for this IPL.

In the message text:\r\nlibid The 5-digit library identifier (serial number).\r\ntext One of the following:\r\nRETURNED INCORRECT AFFINITY DATA\r\nAffinity data is only used for the 3494 and 3495 tape library. This error message indicates that an\r\ninstallation error or microcode error has caused the 3494 or 3495 to report incorrect volume affinity data.\r\nVolume affinity data is an ordered list of subsystem port ids that are used by host software to control\r\ndevice allocation. The ordered list allows the library manager (LM) to direct host allocations to the most\r\nappropriate subsystem. The error that has been detected is that the port IDs in the affinity list do not\r\nmatch those that are known to the host. Port ids that are known to the host are obtained from the\r\nlibrary during IPL or device VARY. As an example, if the library contains subsystems with port IDs\r\n01,02,03,04, those port IDs would be known to the host, and an ordered list from the LM might correctly\r\ncontain 03,02,01,04. The correct list indicates that a device from subsystem 03 should be allocated if\r\npossible, followed in preference by 02, 01 and 04. In the error case, the ordered list from the LM might\r\nincorrectly contain 03,04,05,06. Because port IDs 05 and 06 are unknown to the host, they cannot be\r\nused.\r\nDEVICE(dev) FOUR MINUTE I/O TIMEOUT,REQUEST=request-type,CMDCODE=command-code,CMDORDER=command-suborder,CMDTYPE=command-type\r\nA library request was issued to library (libid ) using device ( dev) and the I/O for the request did not\r\ncomplete within 4 minutes. The system will attempt to recover the failed I/O by selecting another\r\ndevice in the library. If the I/O is successfully recovered, no permanent error is posted. However, if a\r\nsecond 4 minute timeout occurs, a second IEA439I message is issued and the library request is posted in\r\nerror. In the message text, the following diagnostic data is displayed, as appropriate for the command,\r\nwith zeroes being displayed if a value is not applicable:\r\nrequest-type = 1-byte library (LIBSERV) request type\r\ncommand-code = 1-byte command code\r\ncommand-suborder = 1-byte command suborder code\r\ncommand-type = 1-byte command information type\r\nDEVICE(dev) 6D STATE SAVE ISSUED\r\ndev\r\nThe device number of the failing ATLDS device.\r\nTo help diagnose the cause of the 6D DEMOUNT error, an X'87' CCW was issued to the device in order\r\nto obtain a hardware state save. In order for an X'87' CCW to cause a state save, the hardware service\r\nrepresentative must have first prepared the hardware to take state save.\r\nRecovery Action:\r\nv For INCORRECT AFFINITY DATA, contact your hardware service representative to resolve the cause of the\r\nincorrect volume affinity data. After the error condition is corrected, the host begins to use the corrected LM\r\naffinity list (host IPL is not required).\r\nv For FOUR MINUTE I/O TIMEOUT, if this condition persists, contact your hardware service representative to\r\nresolve the cause of the 4 minute timeouts.\r\nv For DEVICE(dev) 6D STATE SAVE ISSUED, in order to obtain diagnostic data, should more 6D demount errors\r\noccur, have the hardware representative prepare the device to take state save.\r\nSystem action:\r\nv For INCORRECT AFFINITY DATA, allocations will not fail. Library allocations are made using a software\r\ngenerated 'affinity' list. The generated list will contain all of the port ids available to the system, in the order that\r\nthey were initialized. Because the affinity list provides load balancing in the library, until the error is corrected,\r\nlibrary performance can be affected.\r\nv For FOUR MINUTE I/O TIMEOUT, if the I/O is successfully recovered then there is no impact on the system\r\n(other than the 4 minute delay). If the retry of a FOUR MINUTE I/O TIMEOUT receives another FOUR MINUTE\r\nI/O TIMEOUT, the I/O request is posted in error. The impact of the error on the system depends on the library\r\nrequest that failed and which component made the request. Refer to additional messages issued by the system\r\ncomponent that made the request.\r\nv For DEVICE(dev) 6D STATE ISSUED, the system will continue to use the device. If a volume is found to be\r\nmounted when the device is next used, the volume is demounted.\r\nSource: AOM Tape Library Services(LIBSERV)\r\nModule: IGX00044\r\nRouting code: 2\r\nDescriptor code: 4", "IAZ0517I": " server_name Error return from getpeername() call,TCP/IP rc: rc\r\nExplanation: The NETSERV socket initialization failed because the socket peer name could not be obtained.\r\nThis message is preceded by message IAZ0545I, which provides additional diagnosis information.\r\nIn the message text:\r\nserver_name\r\nThe NJETCP server name.\r\nrc The errno value from the TCP/IP service getpeername() service.\r\nSystem action: The NETSERV socket connection is brought down.\r\nOperator response: Notify the system programmer.\r\nSystem programmer response: See z/OS Communications Server: IP Sockets Application Programming Interface Guide and\r\nReference for the description of the getpeername() service and the possible return codes.\r\nSource: NETSERV socket initialization\r\nModule: IAZNJSTK\r\nRouting code: 8, 43\r\nDescriptor code: 4", "HZS0406I": " CHECK(checkowner ,checkname): ADD PROCESSING WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL. problem\r\nExplanation: The system processed the request.\r\nIn the message text:\r\ncheckowner\r\nThe owner of the check\r\ncheckname\r\nThe name of the check\r\nproblem\r\nOne of the following:\r\nCOULD NOT LOAD CHECK ROUTINE\r\nThe check routine could not be loaded.\r\nCOULD NOT LOAD MESSAGE TABLE\r\nThe msgtable could not be loaded.\r\nCHECK ALREADY EXISTS\r\nA check or a check description, with the same owner and name already exists.\r\nCHECK DATE IS OLD\r\nThe date is older than the date of an existing check with the same owner and name.\r\nBAD OWNER NAME\r\nThe owner contains characters that are not valid.\r\nBAD CHECK NAME\r\nThe check name contains characters that are not valid.\r\nSystem action: The system continues processing.\r\nOperator response: None\r\nSystem programmer response: None\r\nProblem determination: None\r\nModule: HZSINPRM\r\nRouting Code: 2,11\r\nDescriptor Code: 5\r\nIBM Health Checker for z/OS", "IEA000I": " I/O ERR, aaa,bb ,cccc ,dd00, ffgghhhh\r\nExplanation: This message is sent to the primary operator control station when TCAM error recovery procedures\r\nfail to correct an I/O error.

This is a minimum size and may be\r\nless than the current index CISIZE. Specifying a CISIZE which is smaller than the recommended minimum CI size is\r\nexpected to generate unreachable CIs. The minimum value is based on the average key compression and index\r\nstructure elements of the sequence set and is a value that should ensure that most of the keys for a data CA can be\r\ndescribed in an index CI record. The recommended minimum value also represents the current state of the sequence\r\nset, the specified CISIZE should also consider future activities such as adding keys of different compression lengths\r\nand key deletion which might result in unreachable data CIs in the future. Adding record keys of different\r\ncompression lengths in the future can require a index CISIZE which is larger than the recommended minimum. If the\r\ncurrent index size is smaller than the recommended minimum, a larger index CISIZE may be needed to reduce\r\nunused data CIs that are unreachable because the index record becomes full before all data CIs in the CA are\r\nrepresented. Unreachable data CIs describe empty and unused space within the data component which can\r\ncontribute to unexpected data growth and out of space conditions.This information is provided for CI sizes above\r\nand below the recommended value and does not indicate an error.\r\nNote: Because some keys in the sequence set records may compress better or worse than the average shown, the\r\nrecommended minimum index CISIZE may not necessarily eliminate all unreachable data CIs. The actual and\r\nrecommended sizes might also vary as keys are added or deleted. Since calculations are based on an averaged key\r\nlength, this message only indicates the possibility of an unreachable data CI.

If the record name is followed by a number greater than X'00', the\r\nrecord is an extension record.\r\noffset The offset into the record at which the error was found.\r\nreason-code\r\nThe reason code, as follows:\r\nCode Explanation\r\n1 CELL LENGTH IS ZERO\r\nEach record is composed of cells, each of which has a cell type and a cell length. The indicated\r\nentry has a cell length of zero, which is an error. This error may be caused by incorrect positioning\r\n(caused by some other error) or the length may actually be zero.\r\n2 CELL TYPE NOT RECOGNIZED\r\nVarious catalog records can only contain certain cell types. The record being analyzed contained a\r\ncell type that either did not belong in the record or was not a legal cell type. This error may be\r\ncaused by an incorrect length in the preceding cell that resulted in incorrect positioning.\r\n3 RECORD TYPE NOT RECOGNIZED\r\nEach record in a BCS or VVDS has an record type. The record named has an invalid type for\r\nintegrated catalog facility catalogs.\r\n4 UNEXPECTED RECORD ID ENCOUNTERED\r\nWhile processing an entry, a cell type was encountered that signalled the beginning of a new\r\nrecord. This may be caused by an invalid length value or a damaged entry.\r\n5 COMPONENT LENGTH IS ZERO\r\nVSAM clusters and alternate indexes, and generation data groups, have components. While\r\nchecking one of these types of entries, DIAGNOSE found a component length of zero. However,\r\ncomponent length should always be greater than zero.\r\n6 CELL LENGTH TOO LARGE\r\nA cell length was found that is inconsistent with component or record length. This may describe the\r\ncell being processed or the preceding cell.\r\n7 CELL LENGTHS SUM AND COMPONENT LENGTH DISAGREE\r\nThe sum of all cell lengths in a component is not equal to the component length, which it should\r\nbe. Either the component length is wrong or one of the cell lengths is wrong.\r\n8 REPEATING CELL NOT VALID\r\nAlthough certain cells such as volume cells can occur more than once in an entry, most cells may\r\nnot. The indicated cell occurred more than once, but is a type of cell that should not.\r\n9 RECORD LENGTH INCORRECT\r\nThe record length at the front of the record is not the same as the length stored by VSAM record\r\nmanagement.\r\n10 INCOMPLETE EXTEND DETECTED\r\nThe EXTEND function did not execute to completion. The named entry was interrupted in the\r\nmiddle of an EXTEND/EOV operation.\r\n11 INCOMPLETE DELETE DETECTED\r\nThe DELETE function did not execute to completion. This may indicate existence of partial record\r\nstructures in the BCS.\r\n12 CATLG AND VVDS NAMES UNEQUAL\r\nThere are four name fields in a VVDS record. The BCS entry and the VVDS entry do not have\r\nprecisely the same names (length fields must also be the same) for one of the following four fields:\r\nv Record name\r\nv Subrecord name\r\nv Component name\r\nv Catalog name\r\n13 VVDS AND VTOC EXTENT SEQ. NO. UNEQUAL\r\nVTOC sequence numbers start at 0; VVDS record sequence numbers start at 1. The VVDS record\r\nnumber should always be one greater than the VTOC number. An exception to this rule is the VVR\r\nsequence number for key range data sets.\r\n14 CATLG AND VVDS VOLFLG UNEQUAL\r\nVOLFLG is a field in the VVDS record for the named entry. This field has prime and overflow\r\nindicators. For the named entry, the indicators in the BCS and VVDS are not equal.\r\n15 CATLG AND VVDS KEYS UNEQUAL\r\nBCS and VVDS records both have high and low key fields. The fields and their lengths must be\r\nequal; they were not.\r\n16 VVDS AND VTOC STARTING CCHH UNEQUAL\r\nThe extents in the VTOC DSCB and VVDS record were compared. They were not equal, although\r\nthey should be.\r\n17 VTOC ENTRY NOT FOUND\r\nThe data set control block (DSCB) for the named entry could not be found in the VTOC.\r\n18 VVDS ENTRY NOT FOUND\r\nThere should be a VVDS entry for this BCS entry, but one could not be found.\r\n19 CATLG ENTRY NOT FOUND\r\nThe BCS should have an entry for the VVDS record, but one could not be found.\r\n20 ASSOCIATION NOT FOUND\r\nCertain types of BCS entries may be paired with other BCS entries. For example, catalogs,\r\nnon-VSAM data sets, and generation data sets are paired with their aliases, and VSAM data sets are\r\npaired with their paths. This pairing of one record with another is called an \u201cassociation.\u201d\r\nAssociations between entries are connected by name and are indicated by an association cell in an\r\nentry. The indicated association name cannot be found elsewhere in the BCS.\r\n21 ASSOCIATION LOOP FAILURE\r\nFor an explanation of \u201cassociation\u201d, see reason code 20. If an association can be found, but the\r\nassociation does not point back to the original entry, an association loop failure exists. For example,\r\nif a non-VSAM data set has an alias, the alias record should point back to the non-VSAM data set\r\nrecord.\r\n22 TRUENAME NOT FOUND\r\nVSAM clusters with components have more than one catalog entry. The associated components\r\nhave truename entries. A truename entry was not found, although there should be one.\r\n23 TRUENAME LOOP FAILURE\r\nThe truename entry for a cluster did not point back to the cluster record.\r\n24 REQUIRED CELL MISSING, CELL TYPE type\r\nDepending on the component or entry type, certain cells are required. The cell type indicated is\r\nrequired, but missing.\r\n25 ALLOCATE OF COMPARE DATA SET FAILED\r\nThe BCS named in the VVDS record could not be allocated.\r\n26 CELL TYPE INVALID IN CONTEXT\r\nThe indicated cell is a valid cell type, but it is not valid for the type of entry being scanned.\r\n27 ENTRY MISSING FROM GAT CELL\r\nEach generation data set entry should be reflected in the generation aging table (GAT) cell of the\r\ngeneration data group entry. An entry is missing.\r\n28 GAT CELL ENTRY NOT FOUND\r\nEach entry in a GAT cell represents a generation data set entry within the current generation data\r\ngroup record. No generation data set could be found for a GAT cell entry.\r\n29 ENTRY MISSING FROM REL CELL\r\nEach alternate index entry is reflected in the REL (\u201crelation\u201d) cell of the associated cluster record.\r\nAn alternate index entry was found that was not reflected in a REL cell.\r\n30 REL CELL ENTRY NOT FOUND\r\nAn entry in a REL (\u201crelation\u201d) cell in a cluster record does not represent an alternate index entry.\r\n31 OPEN OF COMPARE DATA SET FAILED\r\nThe BCS named in the VVDS record could not be opened.\r\n32 WRONG RECORD TYPE\r\nA BCS record which matches a VVDS record was found, but the BCS record is not a cluster,\r\ntruename, or non-VSAM record.\r\n33 INCOMPLETE UPDATE DETECTED\r\nThe current entry was undergoing a subrecord update/move operation that did not complete. This\r\nrecord or subrecord may be damaged.\r\n34 VVDS AND VTOC ENDING CCHH UNEQUAL\r\nThe extent information kept in the VTOC and VVDS should agree, but do not.\r\n35 VVDS AND VTOC EXTENT COUNTS UNEQUAL\r\nThe extent information kept in the VTOC and VVDS should agree, but do not.\r\n36 LENGTH OF NAME INVALID\r\nThe length of a name cell should be from 1 to 45 characters long, but is not.\r\n37 ASSOCIATION NAME CELL NOT FOUND\r\nA BCS entry that matches a VVDS record was found, but the BCS entry was missing its required\r\nassociation cell.\r\n38 CLUSTER AND EXTENSION RECS SMS MISMATCH\r\nA VSAM extension record indicates that the cluster is SMS-managed, but the associated cluster\r\nrecord indicates that the cluster is not SMS-managed, or vice versa.\r\n39 BASE OR COMPONENT CELL NOT FOUND\r\nAlthough a truename record was found for a component, the associated cluster record or\r\ncomponent cell was not found.\r\n40 COMPONENT CELL NOT FOUND\r\nThe component cell for a VSAM cluster could not be found within the cluster's sphere record in the\r\nBCS.\r\n41 DUPLICATE VVR/NVRS IN VVDS\r\nTwo VVRs for a VSAM component, or two NVRs for a non-VSAM data set, were found in the\r\nVVDS.

Records existing in a data set prior to the aborted extend operation should\r\nstill be accessible if the data set is opened for input only. You can retrieve these records by using the REPRO\r\ncommand. After you retrieve the records, you can delete or redefine the data set. Then reinsert the records\r\nby using the REPRO command.\r\n11 You can finish the deletion process by rerunning the DELETE job.\r\n12 If the catalog names disagree, remove the entries in the BCS by using the DELETE command with the\r\nNOSCRATCH option. At this point, if the VVDS record contains the desired catalog name, you can catalog\r\nthe data set into the desired BCS by using the DEFINE RECATALOG command; otherwise, catalog the data\r\nset into the catalog indicated in the VVDS record. (It will be necessary to define this catalog if it does not\r\nexist.) Then move the catalog record to the desired catalog by using the REPRO MERGECAT command.\r\nIf the names that disagree are not catalog names, and if the VVDS record is correct, remove the entries from\r\nthe BCS by using the DELETE command with the NOSCRATCH option. Then use the DEFINE\r\nRECATALOG command to recatalog the data set.\r\nIf the VVR is incorrect, remove the data set by using the EXPORT command. At this point, you can import\r\nthe data set using the IMPORT command with the desired NEWNAMES parameter.\r\n25 Check for OPEN or allocation error messages to determine the source of the problem.\r\n31 Check for OPEN or allocation error messages to determine the source of the problem.\r\n38 Delete the cluster entry with DELETE NOSCRATCH, and recatalog it with DEFINE RECATALOG. Then\r\nrebuild the alternate index with DEFINE ALTERNATEINDEX and BLDINDEX.\r\n41 Delete the data set. Then use DELETE VVR or NVR to delete the duplicate VVDS record. Recover the data\r\nset from a backup copy.\r\n42 Use REPRO MERGECAT to move the data set's catalog entry to the correct catalog.\r\n43 Use DELETE NOSCRATCH to delete the BCS record, and DEFINE RECATALOG to recreate the BCS record.\r\nThe storage class and management class may be changed with ALTER if they are incorrect.\r\n45 Delete the orphaned or extra VVDS records.\r\n46 Determine if the BCS named in the VVR is valid.

Possible user error.\r\n18 Explanation: The required library name was not specified for a define library request.\r\nProgrammer Response: Supply a library name and rerun the job.\r\n20 Explanation: Required library ID was not specified for a define library request.\r\nProgrammer Response: Supply a library ID and rerun the job.\r\n22 Explanation: The library logical type specified is incorrect for a define library record request.\r\nProgrammer Response: Supply a valid library logic type and rerun the job.\r\n34 Explanation: Incorrect name was specified for a define volume category request.\r\nProgrammer Response: The volume category's name must begin with SYS1.VOLCAT.V.\r\n40 Explanation: Incorrect checkpoint indicator was specified for a define volume request.\r\nProgrammer Response: Supply a valid checkpoint indicator and rerun the job.\r\n42 Explanation: Incorrect volume location was specified for a define volume request.\r\nProgrammer Response: Supply a valid volume location and rerun the job.\r\n44 Explanation: Required library name not specified for a define volume request with a volume\r\nlocation of library specified.\r\nProgrammer Response: Supply a library name and rerun the job.\r\n46 Explanation: Incorrect volume use attribute specified for a define volume request.\r\nProgrammer Response: Supply a valid use attribute and rerun the job.\r\n48 Explanation: Required volume name not specified for a define volume request.\r\nProgrammer Response: Supply a volume name and rerun the job.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n50 Explanation: Incorrect date format specified.\r\nProgrammer Response: Re-specify the date in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD.\r\n56 Explanation: Attempt to alter the number of scratch volume message thresholds for an incorrect\r\nmedia type.\r\nProgrammer Response: Supply a valid media type and rerun the job.\r\n58 Explanation: Attempt to alter the number of scratch volumes for an incorrect media type.\r\nProgrammer Response: Supply a valid media type and rerun the job.\r\n62 Explanation: No general volume category was found.\r\nProgrammer Response: Define SYS1.VOLCAT.VGENERAL then rerun the job.\r\n66 Explanation: An attempt was made to create a volume or library record into a non-volume catalog.\r\nProgrammer Response: Ensure the high-level qualifier of the volume or library record matches the\r\nhigh-level qualifier of the volume catalog.\r\n68 Explanation: Non-volume category was specified for a request associated with volume or library\r\nrecord.\r\nProgrammer Response: Insure SYS1.VOLCAT.VGENERAL is a volume category for library\r\nrequests. For volume entry requests, check all catalogs with volume category naming convention to\r\nbe volume categories.\r\n70 Explanation: A duplicate entry name was found during define library or volume request.\r\nProgrammer Response: Remove the duplicate entry and rerun the job.\r\n72 Explanation: General volume category had been deleted or disconnected.\r\nProgrammer Response: Redefine or reconnect general volume category.\r\n98 Explanation: Incorrect library name specified for a define library request. The library name cannot\r\nbegin with \u2018V\u2019.\r\nProgrammer Response: Supply a valid library name and rerun the job.\r\n154 Explanation: Attempting to delete a library record which is not empty, or scratch volumes is not\r\nequal to zero.\r\nProgrammer Response: Verify the library record tried to delete. If the library record is empty and\r\nthe scratch volumes count equal to zero then contact the IBM Support Center\r\n158 Explanation: Attempting to delete a volume record that has not reached its expiration date.\r\nProgrammer Response: Verify the expiration date. ALTER command may be used to alter the\r\nexpiration date.\r\n168 Explanation: Attempting to delete a record without specifying the correct type in catalog parameter\r\nlist.\r\nProgrammer Response: Specify the type and rerun the job.\r\nRETURN CODE 32 Explanation:There is an error in the catalog parameter list.\r\nReason Code Description\r\nx Explanation: The length of the catalog work area specified is either zero or too small.\r\nProgrammer Response: If using the CSI, use the value returned in CSIREQLN for the workarea\r\nlength and try again.\r\nRETURN CODE 36 Explanation:Data set not found or DSCB indicates a VSAM data set.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n2 Explanation: An incorrect record type was found in the access method services ALTER command.\r\nProgrammer Response: Determine if the correct name was specified in the command or if the\r\nproper fields are requested to be modified for the entry type.\r\n4 Explanation: A data set name was not found on the VTOC.\r\nProgrammer Response: Ensure that the proper versions of the volume and catalog are being\r\nprocessed and that the volume is synchronized with the catalog, or ensure that the VVR/NVR\r\nentry type in the VVDS matches its corresponding format 1 DSCB record type from the VTOC.\r\n12 Explanation: A locate request to catalog management requires dynamic access to a catalog.\r\nProgrammer Response: If this error causes a job to end, ensure that the master catalog references\r\nthe proper catalogs and that they are available to the system when the job stream is processed.\r\nRETURN CODE 38 Explanation:The catalog installation exit module, replaced by an installation-supplied module,\r\nencountered an error while processing an SVC 26 request. If the module was supplied by the DFSMS hierarchical\r\nstorage manager (DFSMShsm), the message with this return code was preceded by one or more DFSMShsm\r\nmessages (ARCxxxI) that indicate the processing error.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n2 Explanation: An error was encountered while attempting to recall a data set with a volume serial\r\nof MIGRAT. The catalog entry indicated that the data set was migrated, but DFSMShsm\r\ndetermined that the data set was not migrated.\r\nProgrammer Response: Review the DFSMShsm message or messages and take the appropriate\r\naction.\r\n4 Explanation: An error was encountered while attempting to recall a data set with a volume serial\r\nof MIGRAT (the catalog entry indicated that the data set was migrated).\r\nProgrammer Response: Review the DFSMShsm message or messages and take the appropriate\r\naction.\r\n8 Explanation: An error was encountered while attempting to delete a data set with a volume serial\r\nof MIGRAT (the catalog entry indicated that the data set was migrated).\r\nProgrammer Response: Review the DFSMShsm message or messages and take the appropriate\r\naction. Check if an attempt to delete a data set in an alternate catalog occurred, while a duplicately\r\nnamed migrated data set exists in a catalog that can be found in the standard search order (via the\r\nmaster catalog). If so, recall the migrated data set and reissue the delete.\r\n12 Explanation: The catalog installation exit module issued a locate request, and catalog indicated that\r\nthe request was not successful.\r\nProgrammer Response: Review the DFSMShsm message or messages and take the appropriate\r\naction.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n16 Explanation: The catalog installation exit module was processing a JES3 converter/interpreter (C/I)\r\nrequest for a data set with a volume serial of MIGRAT (the catalog entry indicated that the data set\r\nwas migrated). The exit module determined that DFSMShsm was not ready to process the JES3 C/I\r\nrequest because of one of the following reasons:\r\nv DFSMShsm was not active.\r\nv DFSMShsm did not have volumes defined to which the migrated data set could be recalled.\r\nv The storage management subsystem was not available to determine the storage class for a\r\nmigrated SMS-managed data set.\r\nv The recall exit was inoperable.\r\nProgrammer Response: Review the DFSMShsm message or messages and take the appropriate\r\naction. The DFSMShsm message was issued through a TPUT request to the user ID specified on\r\nthe job that requested this function. In other words, the message was not routed to the job log.\r\n24 Explanation: The catalog installation exit module was processing a JES3 (C/I) request for a data\r\nset, and determined that the request was from an unauthorized user.\r\nProgrammer Response: Review the DFSMShsm message or messages and take the appropriate\r\naction. The DFSMShsm message was issued through a TPUT request to the user ID specified on\r\nthe job that requested this function. In other words, the message was not routed to the job log.\r\n48 Explanation: The referenced data set is in an incomplete status.\r\nProgrammer Response: Recall the data set and then issue your request again.\r\n50 Explanation: DFSMShsm generates this reason code when the installation is using the DFSMShsm\r\npatch to prevent interactive TSO users from being placed in a wait state while a data set is recalled.\r\nThis code is generated to cause the locate to fail instead of placing the TSO session in a wait state\r\nand may be ignored. The recall for the data set has been scheduled and the function causing the\r\nrecall should be tried again later.\r\nProgrammer Response: Submit the requested function again.\r\n52 Explanation: For TSO HSM RECALL requents, the RECALL request has been converted to a\r\nbackground request when the attention key is used and message ARC1020I is replied to with 'Y'.\r\nProgrammer Response: Information only. No action is required.\r\nRETURN CODE 40 Explanation:The volume list or work area is too small. This return code would normally\r\nrepresent an error in the calling program. If the user is using the Catalog Search Interface, this return code indicates\r\nthat a large enough return workarea was not provided.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n0 Explanation: The user provided work area is too small.\r\nProgrammer Response: Run the job again with a work area length that is at least equal to the\r\nrequired length.\r\n2 Explanation: The format 1 work area is too small.\r\nProgrammer Response: Run the job again with a work area length that is at least equal to the\r\nrequired length.\r\n8 Explanation: The volume list is too small to include the storage management subsystem workarea.\r\nRETURN CODE 42 Explanation:A DADSM error occurred on branch entry to DADSM back end. The DADSM error\r\nreturn data from the invoked sub-function (SFI) field is the value of the variable sfierror in message IEC331I.\r\nFor details about how to address the errors indicated by the following reason codes, see z/OS DFSMSdfp Diagnosis ,\r\nReason Code Description\r\n2 Explanation: A DADSM RENAME error occurred on branch entry.\r\n4 Explanation: A DADSM ALLOCATE error occurred on branch entry.\r\n6 Explanation: A DADSM SCRATCH error occurred on branch entry.\r\nRETURN CODE 44 Explanation:The catalog work area for returning results of a catalog request is too small to\r\ncontain all of the requested results. If you are using the Catalog Search Interface (CSI) you need to increase the size\r\nof the work area you provide for the request. Other occurrences of this problem may indicate logic errors in\r\ncomponents or products that use catalog services.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n2 Explanation: The delete catalog work area is too small.\r\nProgrammer Response: Check the work area length. If it is correct, contact the IBM Support\r\nCenter. If the length is not correct, run the job again with a valid length.\r\n4 Explanation: The caller's work area is too small.\r\nProgrammer Response: If this is a Catalog Search Interface (CSI) request, you need to increase the\r\nsize of the work area. Otherwise, this may be a logic error or limitation in the component making\r\nthe request.\r\n6 Explanation: An access method services DELETE command to delete an entire generation data\r\ngroup, with the FORCE parameter, encountered a work area too small to contain names of entries\r\ndeleted. However, the entire GDG was successfully deleted. The following then occurs:\r\n1. The work area is not large enough to return the name of the generation data base.\r\n2. The system does not delete the catalog.\r\nProgrammer Response: Run the job again with a larger work area.\r\n8 Explanation: The caller's work area is too small.\r\nProgrammer Response: If this is a Catalog Search Interface (CSI) request, you need to increase the\r\nsize of the work area. Otherwise, this may be a logic error or limitation in the component making\r\nthe request.\r\n12 Explanation: The amount of data that the system will return may overflow the workarea.\r\nProgrammer Response: Either divide the catalog into smaller catalogs or convert to the ICF catalog\r\nformat.\r\n14 Explanation: The amount of data returned by the system cannot be contained in a 2-byte length\r\nfield.\r\nProgrammer Response: None. This is a design limitation. If you are using the CSI (Catalog Search\r\nInterface), you must request that fullword lengths be used for all lengths.\r\nRETURN CODE 45 Explanation:The Catalog encountered an unexpected error while issuing the UCBPIN macro.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n1 Explanation: UCBPIN PIN returned an unexpected return code.\r\nProgrammer Response: Contact the IBM Service Center. An SVC dump might have been produced\r\nfor this error.\r\n2 Explanation: UCBPIN UNPIN returned an unexpected return code.\r\nProgrammer Response: Contact the IBM Service Center. An SVC dump might have been produced\r\nfor this error.\r\nRETURN CODE 46 Explanation:Catalog received an error from a VSAM request.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n2 Explanation: VSAM has detected an internal error while processing a catalog index.\r\nProgrammer Response: Rerun the request. If the error continues, seez/OS DFSMSdfp Diagnosis ,\r\ninstruction.\r\nRETURN CODE 48 Explanation:Incorrect catalog function.\r\nReason Code Description\r\nx Explanation: An internal logic error has occurred.\r\nProgrammer Response: Contact the IBM Support Center.\r\n6 Explanation: An ALTER of a non-VSAM entry is not allowed for the fields being modified.\r\nProgrammer Response: Ensure that the proper entry name was specified on the access method\r\nservices ALTER command and that only fields that exist for a non-VSAM entry are requested to be\r\nchanged.\r\n8 Explanation: An ALTER of the catalog name is not allowed.\r\nProgrammer Response: Ensure that the catalog name was not used by mistake. Catalog names can\r\nonly be changed by DELETE and then re-DEFINE catalog commands.\r\n10 Explanation: Erase option delete, but file name is for incorrect catalog.\r\nProgrammer Response: Do not use a DD name on the catalog parameter in the access method\r\nservices DELETE command if erase processing is to be performed.\r\n14 Explanation: A data set is update inhibited.\r\nProgrammer Response: Do not open a data set for reset processing that is inhibited for update\r\nprocessing.\r\n16 Explanation: A data set is not reusable.\r\nProgrammer Response: Do not open a non-empty data set for reset processing that is not reusable.\r\n18 Explanation: It is only valid to change the attributes or owner id fields of a GDG base entry by the\r\naccess method services ALTER command.\r\nProgrammer Response: Do not attempt the incorrect ALTER commands. Correct the commands\r\nand rerun the job.\r\n24 Explanation: It is not valid to attempt to change the name of a user catalog or alias entry through\r\nthe use of the access method services ALTER Command.\r\nProgrammer Response: Do not attempt the incorrect ALTER commands. Correct the commands\r\nand rerun the job.\r\n26 Explanation: It is not valid to attempt to change the name of a non-VSAM entry that is a GDG\r\nbase or member through the use of the access method services ALTER command.\r\nProgrammer Response: Do not attempt the incorrect ALTER commands. Correct the commands\r\nand rerun the job.\r\n28 Explanation: It is not valid to attempt to delete a GDG base entry that contains non-VSAM entries.\r\nProgrammer Response: Delete the members of the GDG base explicitly. Alternatively, the GDG\r\nbase and its members may be deleted with the use of the FORCE parameter in the DELETE\r\ncommand.\r\n29 Explanation: RBA too large for data set.\r\n30 Explanation: It is not valid to delete the master catalog with the FORCE parameter.\r\nProgrammer Response: The master catalog cannot be deleted. Submit the job again.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n36 Explanation: The ALTER REMOVEVOLUMES volume cleanup function contains incorrect coded\r\nparameters.\r\nProgrammer Response: Only the master catalog name, password, and file parameters may be\r\ncoded for the ALTER REMOVEVOLUMES function.\r\n40 Explanation: An incorrect catalog management function, ALTER of a VVDS name, occurred.\r\nProgrammer Response: Do not attempt the incorrect ALTER commands. Correct the commands.\r\nRun the job again.\r\n42 Explanation: The maximum number of extensions was exceeded.\r\nProgrammer Response: Redefine the catalog with a RECORDSIZE specifying a maximum of 32400.\r\n54 Explanation: An incorrect reset of a non-reusable data set was detected.\r\nProgrammer Response: Do not open a non-empty data set for reset processing that is not reusable.\r\n56 Explanation: The data set update is inhibited.\r\nProgrammer Response: Do not open a data set for reset processing that is inhibited for update\r\nprocessing.\r\n60 Explanation: A define no-allocate or RECATALOG was not APF authorized.\r\nProgrammer Response: Probable user error. Ensure that access method services is APF authorized.\r\n64 Explanation: A DEFINE of a SYS1.VVDS.Vvolser cannot request space in records.\r\nProgrammer Response: Change records to tracks or cylinders. Run the DEFINE command again.\r\n70 Explanation: An ALTER LOCK of the master catalog is not allowed.\r\n72 Explanation: An incorrect catalog management function alter of a non-VSAM data set name that is\r\ncataloged with an indirect volser occurred.\r\n74 Explanation: An alter newname of a tape data set is incorrect.\r\nProgrammer Response: Do not attempt the incorrect ALTER commands. Correct the commands.\r\nRun the job again.\r\n76 Explanation: An alter of non-VSAM data set that contains the extended format cell is not allowed.\r\nProgrammer Response: None\r\n78 Explanation: The conversion of SMS to non-SMS managed cannot be done for a data set that\r\ncontains the extended format cell.\r\n80 Explanation: Define data set with extended format information is not valid for a non-SMS data set.\r\n90 Explanation: Re-cataloging a temporary VSAM data set is not allowed.\r\n94 Explanation: The conversion of SMS to non-SMS managed cannot be done for a data set that\r\ncontains attributes extension information.\r\n96 Explanation: Define data set with attributes extension information is not valid for a non-SMS data\r\nset.\r\n98 Explanation: A define of non-extended data set that contains compress information is not allowed.\r\nProgrammer Response: None\r\n102 Explanation: The request is against an SMS-managed data set, but the specified data set is not SMS\r\nmanaged.\r\n104 Explanation: The user is not authorized to issue ALTER no VVDS update.\r\n108 Explanation: The specified SMS construct cannot be altered.\r\n112 Explanation: A VSAM data set cannot be converted to an SMS managed data set because not all of\r\nits components' names resolve to the same catalog.\r\n118 Explanation: A SMS storage class construct cannot be blanks.\r\n120 Explanation: The ALTER NEWNAME is not allowed for non-VSAM data set with an alias when\r\nthe new name resolves to a different catalog than the current one.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n122 Explanation: The ALTER NEWNAME is not allowed for VSAM data set when the new name\r\nresolves to a different catalog than the current one.\r\n124 Explanation: A VSAM data set cannot be converted to SMS managed because not all of the\r\nvolumes belong to the same storage group.\r\n126 Explanation: A VSAM data set cannot be converted to SMS managed because not all of its\r\nassociated names in the sphere resolve to the same catalog.\r\n128 Explanation: An SMS storage class construct cannot have a length of zero.\r\n130 Explanation: Altering a non-SMS managed VSAM data set to an SMS managed one (or vice versa)\r\nis a stand-alone function. No other ALTER functions are allowed.\r\n132 Explanation: Altering a non-specific volume serial to a specific one is a stand-alone function. No\r\nother ALTER functions are allowed.\r\n134 Explanation: The user is not authorized to alter a non-specific volume or the user attempted to\r\nalter a non-SMS managed data set to include non-specific volser.\r\n136 Explanation: An incorrect component was supplied for ALTER non-specific volume.\r\n140 Explanation: An ALTER GDG limit of 0 is not allowed.\r\n142 Explanation: An ALTER fails due to unsuccessful DADSM UPDATE function.\r\n144 Explanation: A Record unit of allocation not valid for linear data sets.\r\n146 Explanation: The ALTER NONVSAM RECATALOG function and the caller pass SMS information\r\nfor conversion, but the caller is not authorized to use this function.\r\n148 Explanation: Alter request is not valid for stand-alone function such as alter of backup while open\r\n(BWO) data set.\r\nProgrammer Response: Ensure that the field requested to be altered is valid for stand-alone\r\nfunction.\r\n152 Explanation: An attempt has been made to define a PDSE as a member of a GDG base. PDSEs may\r\nnot be a member of a GDG base\r\nProgrammer Response: Be sure that the IGDSMS00 parmlib member has DSNTYPE default of PDS.\r\n156 Explanation: The alter backup while open (BWO) request is not for valid component or record.\r\nProgrammer Response: Ensure that the BWO alter request is for cluster, data, non-VSAM, or GDS\r\nonly.\r\n158 Explanation: The alter backup while open (BWO) indicator is incorrect for non-SMS managed data\r\nsets\r\nProgrammer Response: Ensure that the data set is SMS-managed.\r\n160 Explanation: An attempt was made to alter a non-SMS managed non-VSAM data set to a name in\r\nthe format of a GDS (for example, the name ends with GnnnnVnn).\r\nProgrammer Response: Change the name of the new data set to be a non-GDS format name.\r\n162 Explanation: An attempt was made to alter a non-SMS managed GDS to a non-GDS name.\r\n166 Explanation: An alter volume or device type on OAM entries is not allowed.\r\nProgrammer Response: None\r\n168 Explanation: An attempt was made to alter an SMS-managed non-VSAM data set to a GDS name\r\n(for example, the name ends with GnnnnVnn), but there is no GDG base associated with the new\r\nname.\r\nProgrammer Response: Change the name of the new data set to one that has an existing GDG base\r\ndefinition.\r\n170 Explanation: When defining an OAM data set, a generation data set low level qualifier (that is,\r\nG0000V00) or an increment of a GDG number (that is, +1) is invalid.\r\nProgrammer Response: Use a name other than the GDS low level qualifier or a GDG increment\r\nnumber. Rerun the define request.\r\n172 Explanation: REUSE was specified for a non-cluster component or a component that had an AIX\r\nAssociated with it.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n174 Explanation: ALTER REUSE was specified for a cluster that has an AIX defined over it.\r\n175 Explanation: A DEFINE of a striped data set specified REUSE, which is invalid.\r\n176 Explanation: ALTER REUSE was specified for a cluster that contains a KEYRANGE.\r\n178 Explanation: ALTER-REUSE-ON and ALTER-REUSE-OFF are mutually exclusive. They cannot be\r\nactive at the same time.\r\nProgrammer Response: Only one ALTER-REUSE bit should be set at a time.\r\n184 Explanation: Attempted to ALTER the DDM file class attribute for other than a CLUSTER or\r\nNONVSAM entry.\r\n186 Explanation: Attempted to ALTER the pointer to the last active record for other than CLUSTER or\r\nNONVSAM entry.\r\n188 Explanation: Attempted to ALTER DFM attributes for a non-SMS data set.\r\n190 Explanation: Attempted to ALTER DFM attributes for other than a CLUSTER entry.\r\n192 Explanation: Attempted to ALTER DFM attributes for other than a CLUSTER or NONVSAM entry.\r\n194 Explanation: A specific request to locate an OAM data set was made and a data set was found, but\r\nit is not an OAM data set name.\r\nProgrammer Response: Verify that the name of the data set desired is an OAM data set.\r\n196 Explanation: A specific request to locate an OAM data set was made and a data set was found, but\r\nit is not an OAM data set name.\r\nProgrammer Response: Verify that the name of the data set desired is an OAM data set.\r\n200 Explanation: The ALTER ADDVOL function cannot be used to cause the number of volumes of a\r\nSMS-managed data set to exceed the maximum of 59 volumes.\r\nProgrammer Response: The maximum allowable volumes for a SMS-managed data set is 59.

If the problem persists,\r\ncontact the IBM support center with the job output and/or dump.\r\nRETURN CODE 50 Explanation:An error has been detected in VVDS manager. There may besfi information for this\r\nmessage. Message IEC331I might be produced for the error and can contain additional information (SFI) for\r\ndiagnostic use.\r\nReason Code Description\r\nx Explanation: An internal logic error has occurred, or an error has been detected in the structure or\r\ncontents of a VVDS.\r\nProgrammer Response: Run a DIAGNOSE and print the VVDS associated with the problem. These\r\nerrors will usually be accompanied by additional console messages which contain SFI information\r\nnecessary to diagnose the problem. Contact the IBM Support Center.\r\n2 Explanation: New catalog name added. This is a normal return code returned during the adding of\r\na new VVR. The associated catalog name of the VVR was new to the VVDS and was added to the\r\nVVCR/VVCN record.\r\nProgrammer Response: None\r\n4 Explanation: VVDS Manager parameter list had incorrect information. This attention error code\r\ndoes not effect the operation of the request.\r\nProgrammer Response: Contact the IBM Support Center.\r\n5 Explanation: The VVDS required for LISTCAT could not be accessed. The missing data in the\r\nLISTCAT output will contain Xs. The volume might be offline, but a mount request is not\r\nautomatically issued for a LISTCAT operation. If present, the sfi value is FOR volser, where volser is\r\nthe volume serial of the VVDS on which the error was detected.\r\nProgrammer Response: Ignore the return code or ensure the volume is online and available for the\r\nLISTCAT operation.\r\n6 Explanation: A requested VVR or NVR was not found in the VVDS specified. If present in this\r\nmessage, the sfi value is FOR volser, where volser is the volume serial of the VVDS on which the\r\nerror was detected. The sfi value in message IEC331I contains characters 5 through twelve of the\r\nrequested VVR name.\r\nProgrammer Response: Ensure that the volume serial numbers provided in VOLUMES parameters\r\nand DD statements are correct. If all the commands are specified correctly, this condition may\r\nindicate an error in the catalog or VVDS. Run the DIAGNOSE command to determine if any\r\ncatalog records are in error.\r\n7 Explanation: One or more of the 3 required VVRs for a catalog was not found. sfi in message IEC331I contains the first 8 characters of the catalog name whose VVR(s) was missing.\r\nProgrammer Response: Run DIAGNOSE command against the VVDS and correct any problem\r\ndetected.\r\n8 Explanation: A DEFINE command for a VVDS has failed because a VVDS already exists on the\r\nvolume. No SFI data.\r\nProgrammer Response: If the existing VVDS is to be replaced, delete it before defining the new\r\nVVDS.\r\n9 Explanation: A dynamic allocation will require a TIOT slot, but a search finds none available. No\r\nSFI data.\r\nProgrammer Response: Contact the IBM Support Center.\r\n10 Explanation: Bad return code from dynamic allocation issued from DFSMS/MVS. SFI contains the\r\nSVC 99 reason code.\r\nProgrammer Response: Ensure that the VVDS name or the volume serial number provided is\r\ncorrect. If an access method services command was being processed, ensure that all required FILE\r\nparameters are supplied. Ensure that the volume will be mounted and available by providing a DD\r\nstatement for the volume.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n11 Explanation: The caller of the VVDS manager passed a volume serial number in the parameter list\r\nand a UCB address. The UCB's volume serial does not match the parameter list volume serial. The\r\nSFI contains the UCB volume serial while the parameter list volume serial is in the second field in\r\nthe SFI data.\r\nProgrammer Response: Contact the IBM Support Center.\r\n12 Explanation: An attempt to allocate space on a DASD volume has failed. SFI contains the historical\r\nreturn code from DADSM allocate.\r\nProgrammer Response: Ensure that there is enough space for the VVDS data set being defined. The\r\ndata set will require a minimum of three to four tracks. If space was available when the error\r\noccurred, contact the IBM Support Center.\r\n13 Explanation: The VSAM volume data set (VVDS) request contained an invalid volume serial\r\nnumber (VOLSER). The invalid VOLSER might be available with the structured field introducers\r\n(SFI) information.\r\nProgrammer Response: Rerun the request with a valid VOLSER.\r\n14 Explanation: A request to delete a VVDS has failed because the VVDS still contained VVRs. SFI\r\ncontains the RBA of the first CI that contains a VVR.\r\nProgrammer Response: If the VVDS is to be deleted, first delete the VSAM data sets on the volume\r\nand then run the DELETE command again. Or, if the VVDS is to be recovered, run the DELETE\r\ncommand again with the RECOVERY parameter.\r\n16 Explanation: No storage was available for the VVDS manager work area. There may be no SFI data\r\nbecause the working storage for the VVDS manager could not be obtained. Otherwise, SFI will\r\ncontain the register 15 return code from the GETMAIN request.\r\nProgrammer Response: Contact the IBM Support Center.\r\n17 Explanation: No storage was available for VVDS manager buffers. SFI contains \u2018xxxxzzzz \u2019 where\r\nxxxxis the amount of storage being requested and zzzz is the register 15 return code from the\r\nGETMAIN request.\r\nProgrammer Response: Increase available LSQA storage. This error can sometimes be avoided by\r\ndecreasing the region size.\r\n18 Explanation: An I/O error has been detected while accessing a VVDS record. This reason code\r\nresults in message IEC161I being issued, which provides more information about the error. An SVC\r\ndump may also have been created, depending on the type of error that occurred.\r\nProgrammer Response: A DIAGNOSE should be run against the VVDS indicated in message IEC161I. If an SVC dump was produced, contact the IBM Support Center.\r\n25 Explanation: An OBTAIN was issued to read the F1 DSCB for an existing VVDS and OBTAIN\r\nreturned with an error. SFI contains the register 15 return code from OBTAIN.\r\nProgrammer Response: A failure to obtain a DSCB for a VVR may indicate either a damaged\r\nVVDS or the existence of an orphan VVR. In either case, enter the DIAGNOSE command to check\r\nthe integrity of the VVDS. Correct any errors found as a result of using the DIAGNOSE command.\r\n26 Explanation: An OBTAIN was issued to read the F1 DSCB for a new VVDS and OBTAIN returned\r\nwith an error. SFI contains the register 15 return code from OBTAIN.\r\nProgrammer Response: A failure to obtain a DSCB for a VVR may indicate either a damaged\r\nVVDS or the existence of an orphan VVR. In either case, enter the DIAGNOSE command to check\r\nthe integrity of the VVDS. Correct any errors found as a result of using the DIAGNOSE command.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n28 Explanation: A call to VSAM end of volume to extent the VVDS has failed. SFI contains register 15\r\nreturn code from end of volume.\r\nProgrammer Response: There is probably insufficient space on the volume or in the VTOC to\r\nextend the VVDS, in which case no more VSAM data sets can be defined on that volume until\r\nspace is made available to extend the VVDS. If sufficient space is available at the time this error\r\noccurs, contact the IBM Support Center.\r\n30 Explanation: While updating the VVDS, it was found to be full and needed to extend, but was\r\nalready at the maximum number of extents (123). There is no SFI data.\r\nProgrammer Response: The volume must be recovered from backup after creating a larger VVDS,\r\nor unneeded data sets on the volume must be deleted to release space in the VVDS.\r\n32 Explanation: The VVDS is full (maximum 1048575 CIs). There is no SFI data.\r\nProgrammer Response: If a VSAM data set was being defined, use an alternate volume. If a VVDS\r\nwas being defined, decrease the primary space allocation.\r\n36 Explanation: A request to write a VVR could not be processed because the VVR was larger than\r\nthe max size of a valid VVR. SFI contains the VVR length.\r\nProgrammer Response: Run a DIAGNOSE and print the VVDS associated with the problem. These\r\nerrors will usually be accompanied by additional console messages which contain SFI information\r\nnecessary to diagnose the problem. Contact the IBM Support Center.\r\n38 Explanation: A DELETE command with the NOSCRATCH parameter has been issued for a catalog.\r\nThe VVR for the catalog was not deleted because the catalog has data on the volume. SFI contains\r\nthe RBA of the first CI that has a VVR owned by the catalog.\r\nProgrammer Response: Ensure that the correct catalog is being used and that the VVDS is correctly\r\nspecified.\r\n40 Explanation: A call to scratch the F1 DSCB from a volume has failed. SFI contains the return code\r\nfrom the scratch.\r\nProgrammer Response: It is possible that a user other than the one issuing the delete has an\r\noutstanding ENQ on the VVDS. If this is the case, the ENQ should be removed.\r\n80 Explanation: An internal VVDS logic error has occurred. If the SFI information contains\r\n\u201cIORUNING\u201d, the job associated with the catalog request may have been terminated abnormally\r\n(for example, operator CANCEL, TSO attention ) and this does not represent an internal logic error.\r\nProgrammer Response: If the SFI information contains \u201cIORUNING\u201d, check console and job logs\r\nfor the associated job to see if it was abnormally terminated. You should run a DIAGNOSE against\r\nVVDS on the volume indicated to check for any possible damage. If the SFI information is not\r\n\u201cIORUNING\u201d, you should contact IBM Service.\r\n82 Explanation: The system discovered, during synchronization processing of the VTOC and VVR\r\nextents, that the number of extents indicated for the data set in the VTOC is more than the number\r\nindicated in the VVR.\r\nProgrammer Response: Print the VVDS and VTOC. Contact the IBM Support Center.\r\n84 Explanation: The system discovered, during synchronization processing of the VTOC and VVR\r\nextents, that the number of extents indicated for the data set in the VVR is more than the number\r\nindicated in the VTOC.\r\nProgrammer Response: Print the VVDS and VTOC. Contact the IBM Support Center.\r\n85 Explanation: During synchronization processing of the VTOC and VVR extents, the VVDS manager\r\nwas unable to read the DSCBS.\r\nProgrammer Response: Print the VVDS and VTOC. Contact the IBM Support Center.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n86 Explanation: The VVR for the VVDS number of extents field is not valid; it has more than 123\r\nextents in it. SFI contains the VVR's extent number.\r\nProgrammer Response: Print the VVDS. Contact the IBM Support Center.\r\n87 Explanation: During open processing of a VSAM data set, the system discovered that there were\r\nfewer extents in the VTOC than were described in the VVDS for the component, or that the extent\r\nranges did not match between the VVDS and VTOC.\r\nSystem Action: The data set will not be permitted to open. Message IEC331I is issued to detail\r\nwhich volume and component is incorrect.\r\nProgrammer Response: Use LISTCAT and LISTVTOC to determine the details of the mismatch.\r\nThe data set must be recreated to correct the error.\r\n88 Explanation: A VVR or NVR with the correct component name was found, but the catalog name\r\ndid not match. On a delete request, the BCS record will be deleted, but the VVR or NVR and the\r\nformat 1 DSCB will not be scratched. There is no SFI data.\r\nProgrammer Response: No action is required because this code is for information only.\r\n89 Explanation: During open processing of a VSAM data set, the system discovered that there were\r\nextra extents in the VTOC that are not described in the VVR.\r\nSystem Action: Message IEC331I is issued to detail which volume and component of the data set\r\nhas extra extents on the volume. Open processing continues. In most cases, on the next extend of\r\nthe data set the extra extents will be recognized and incorporated into the data set extents.\r\n92 Explanation: A request to allocate dynamically the VVDS has failed. SFI contains the dynamic\r\nallocation error reason code returned in the SVC 99 request block, or text stating why the allocation\r\nroutine failed.\r\nProgrammer Response: Determine why the dynamic allocation reason code was returned.\r\n94 Explanation: A VSAM OPEN request to open the VVDS failed. SFI contains \u2018xxrrrrrr \u2019, where\r\nrrrrrr=register 15 from the OPEN and xx is ACBERFLG.\r\nProgrammer Response: Determine why the OPEN reason code was returned.\r\n96 Explanation: A record read from the VVDS was found to be invalid.\r\nSystem Action: Message IEC331I will be issued in the job log and will contain the RBA and\r\nvolume serial of the invalid record. An SVC dump will be created for the problem.\r\nProgrammer Response: A DIAGNOSE of the VVDS should be performed and any errors related to\r\nthe VVDS corrected. If no errors are detected, contact IBM Service and provide the SVC dump for\r\nanalysis.\r\n100 Explanation: A F1 DSCB with a SYS1.VVDS.Vxxxxxx was found and it is not a VSAM data set. A\r\nVVDS cannot be created or opened for this volume.\r\nProgrammer Response: Determine the source of the non-VSAM data set and have it renamed or\r\nremoved.\r\n126 Explanation: VVDS detected a potential problem with VVDS internal structure. When attempting to\r\ncorrect problem a free control interval (CI) could not be found, which was required for the repair\r\noperation. An SVC dump should have occurred.\r\nProgrammer Response: Run a DIAGNOSE and print the VVDS associated with the problem.\r\nContact IBM Service and provide the SVC dump plus the DIAGNOSE and print of the problem\r\nVVDS.\r\n128 Explanation: A VVDS request (add, insert, or delete) took very long to complete.\r\nProgrammer Response: Please provide any dumps to IBM support.\r\nRETURN CODE 52 Explanation:An error occurred while attempting to access a VTOC.\r\nReason Code Description\r\nx Explanation: The reason codes associated with this error are from one of the following:\r\nv OBTAIN return code\r\nv DADSM diagnostic code or DADSM return code\r\nv CVAF CVSTAT code.\r\nProgrammer Response: Ensure that there is enough space on the volume and in the VTOC for the\r\ndata set being defined. If space was available when the error occurred and there were sufficient\r\nfree format 0 DSCBs in the VTOC, contact the IBM Support Center.\r\nRETURN CODE 56 Explanation:A security verification failed.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n2 Explanation: The system attempted to verify alter authority to the master catalog (update authority\r\nfor an ALTER NEWNAME), but the user did not have the required authority.\r\nProgrammer Response: Ensure the user has the proper authority to the master catalog. For some\r\ntypes of requests, only the proper data set authority is required, and the master catalog is only\r\nchecked if they do not have necessary data set authority. Granting the authority to the data set may\r\neliminate this error.\r\n4 Explanation: A non-system caller has specified request special authority level checking in the\r\ncatalog parameter list.\r\nProgrammer Response: Contact the IBM Support Center if the user written programs are not\r\ncalling catalog management.\r\n6 Explanation: The user did not have the required access authority to the specified entry.\r\nProgrammer Response: Ensure the user has the proper RACF authorization for the function being\r\nrequested.\r\n8 Explanation: The return code from the RACHECK REQUEST=AUTH was other than 0, 4, or 8.\r\nProgrammer Response: Determine the reason for the unexpected RACF return code.\r\n14 Explanation: An implicit alter of a GDG was denied because the user did not have the proper\r\nauthority to the GDG base and the catalog.\r\nProgrammer Response: Ensure the user has the proper authority for the GDG base.\r\n16 Explanation: The caller is not authorized for the requested SMS Management Class, SMS Storage\r\nClass, or both.\r\n28 Explanation: An unauthorized caller attempted to define an SMS data set.\r\nProgrammer Response: Ensure the caller is APF authorized, or system key or system state.\r\n30 Explanation: The caller was not authorized to the catalog when defining an SMS data set into the\r\nmaster catalog.\r\n32 Explanation: The return code from the RACHECK REQUEST=AUTH was other than 0, 4, or 8\r\nwhen attempting to verify access to a facility class.\r\nProgrammer Response: Determine the reason for the unexpected RACF return code.\r\n34 Explanation: An internal logic error has occurred.\r\nProgrammer Response: Contact the IBM Support Center.\r\n36 Explanation: The caller is not authorized. When no profile exists for functions that require RACF\r\nauthorization, the caller must be at least APF authorized.\r\n40 Explanation: RACF options do not permit use or cataloging of uncataloged non-SMS managed data\r\nsets.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n42 Explanation: Caller is not authorized to use the specified volume.\r\nProgrammer Response: Acquire authority to the specified volume and resubmit the job.\r\n44 Explanation: Caller is not authorized to update catalog for DEFINE ATL request\r\nRETURN CODE 58 Explanation:An error was encountered in Define request of the dataset.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n2 Explanation: The allocation quantity requested for the dataset resulted in an amount greater than\r\n16,777,215 CYL on the primary space quantity.\r\nProgrammer Response: Reduce the primary space quantity and rerun the request.\r\n4 Explanation: The allocation quantity requested for the dataset resulted in an amount greater than\r\n16,777,215 CYL on the secondary space quantity.\r\nProgrammer Response: Reduce the secondary space quantity and rerun the request.\r\n6 Explanation: The striped data set was allocated with a primary space allocation of more than\r\n16777215 tracks.

This condition indicates that a system error has\r\noccurred such that the catalog cannot find either a data or an index entry which is associated with a cluster or\r\nalternate index entry.\r\nReason Code Description\r\nx Explanation: An internal logic error has occurred.\r\nProgrammer Response: Contact the IBM Support Center.\r\n6 Explanation: The association of a true name record in an ICF catalog is incorrect.\r\nProgrammer Response: Use access method services to define the associated base of the true name\r\nrecord.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n8\r\nExplanation: The association of a true name record is not in the IEASYMxx member, or the\r\nSYMBOLICRELATE function did not provide a symbolic item.\r\nProgrammer Response: Check the IEASYMxx to ensure that the item has a symbolic item, or the\r\nSYMBOLICRELATE function does not provide a symbolic item.\r\nRETURN CODE 66 Explanation:Bad DADSM parameter list.\r\nReason Code Description\r\nx Explanation: The reason code listed is the return code from the DADSM function, which may have\r\nbeen a RENAME or a SCRATCH request.\r\nRETURN CODE 68 Explanation:No space is available on the user volume. Only the primary volume will be used\r\nfor ICF catalogs.\r\nReason Code Description\r\nx Explanation: The returned DADSM Historic Return Code was other than 0, 4, 8, or 12. The reason\r\ncode shown is the DADSM return code. See z/OS DFSMSdfp Diagnosis for an explanation of the\r\nDADSM return and diagnostic codes.\r\nProgrammer Response: The return code is returned by DADSM.\r\n22, 24 Explanation: An attempt to allocate an SMS-managed data set using the Best Fit interface was able\r\nto allocate space on all supplied volumes, but the amount of space allocated was not the total\r\namount required. If the data set being allocated was not SMS-managed then reason code 20\r\nindicates requested space was not available; The primary allocation amount must be able to be\r\nallocated within 5 extents. For a non SMS-managed VSAM data set the primary allocation amount\r\nmust be available on each volume if the data set is a multivolume data set.\r\nProgrammer Response: The storage group did not contain sufficient space to allocate the data set.\r\nIf this was a non SMS-managed data set being allocated, the volume(s) did not have sufficient\r\nspace for the primary allocation amount.\r\n26 Explanation: An attempt to allocate an SMS-managed data set using the Best Fit interface resulted\r\nin more than 255 extents for the data set. VSAM data sets are limited to a maximum of 255 extents.\r\nProgrammer Response: This is most likely a result of significant fragmentation on the volumes\r\nselected. Volume reorganization should be performed, or additional volumes added to the storage\r\ngroup with sufficient contiguous space to allow to the allocate to complete.\r\n28 Explanation: The volume does not contain enough track-managed space to allocate the BCS, VVDS\r\nor page data set.\r\nProgrammer Response: Try the request with a different volume.\r\nRETURN CODE 70 Explanation:Component not found.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n0 Explanation: An internal logic error has occurred processing a GDS record.\r\nProgrammer Response: Contact the IBM Support Center.\r\nRETURN CODE 72 Explanation:The user volume is not mounted. The reason codes are from VSAM\r\nopen/close/end-of-volume, volume mount and verify routine IDA0192V.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n4 Explanation: Unable to mount user volumes.\r\nProgrammer Response: Ensure that proper volumes are implicitly or explicitly allocated by the\r\nJCL.\r\n8 Explanation: An error occurred while attempting to mount the user volume. Examples of possible\r\nerrors include insufficient virtual storage for workareas or a time-stamp mismatch problem.\r\nProgrammer Response: Verify that the volume and the volume information (time stamps)\r\ncontained in the catalog are at the same level.

There is insufficient virtual storage available.\r\nProgrammer Response: Increase the region size available to the step.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n10 Explanation: A GETMAIN failure occurred. There is insufficient virtual storage available for the\r\ncatalog communication area.\r\nProgrammer Response: Increase the region size available to the step.\r\nRETURN CODE 168 Explanation: Unsupported device type.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n2 Explanation: One of the following has occurred:\r\n1. An access method services DEFINE or IMPORT command specifies a device type that was not\r\nsystem generated into the system, or is not acceptable for a catalog or data set.\r\n2. The volume serial number specified is incorrect, or the volume serial number is missing.\r\nProgrammer Response: Specify a device type or device name that is acceptable to the system.\r\n4 Explanation: An incorrect device name was specified on a define of a non-VSAM entry.\r\nProgrammer Response: Specify a device type or device name that is acceptable to the system.\r\nRETURN CODE 172 Explanation: A duplicate data set name was detected on a volume during a DEFINE or ALTER\r\nNEWNAME, or a DADSM error occurred during an ALTER NEWNAME.\r\nReason Code Description\r\nx Explanation: The return code from a failed DADSM RENAME.\r\n2 Explanation: A duplicate name was detected on a volume during a define of a data set.\r\nProgrammer Response: Select another data set name, scratch the original data set from the volume,\r\nor ensure that there are as many volumes as key ranges for the define of a unique key sequenced\r\ndata set (KSDS).\r\nRETURN CODE 176 Explanation: There is no space in the VTOC for a DSCB. During the definition or extension of a\r\ndata space, an attempt was made to perform a DADSM allocate or extend function on a volume in which a new\r\nDSCB was to have been written, but there is no space in the VTOC for an additional DSCB. The problem might also\r\nbe with the size of the VTOC index or lack of room in it.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n0 Programmer Response: Delete any unneeded data sets or data spaces from the volume to make\r\nadditional DSCBs available, or re-create the volume with a larger VTOC.\r\nRETURN CODE 178 Explanation: An error occurred during ICF catalog processing of a VSAM partial release\r\nrequest.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n2 Explanation: The open-for-output indicator was found on in the catalog while a partial release\r\nrequest was being processed. Partial release processing cannot occur if there are other users opened\r\nto the data set.\r\nProgrammer Response: Run an IDCAMS verify against the data set to reset the open-for-output\r\nindicator and re-run the partial release request.\r\n4 Explanation: The data set is not an extended format VSAM cluster. Partial release processing is\r\nsupported only for extended format VSAM clusters.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n6 Explanation: The data set name passed to a VSAM partial release request was not a VSAM cluster\r\ndata component.\r\nProgrammer Response: Ensure the name being passed is the VSAM cluster data component and\r\nre-run the partial release request.\r\n8 Explanation: A DADSM partial release request failed.\r\nProgrammer Response: Examine the job and system log for related messages explaining the\r\nDADSM failure.\r\n10 Explanation: An attempt was made to perform partial release processing against a data set defined\r\nwith guaranteed space. Guaranteed space data sets are not supported for partial release processing.\r\n12 Explanation: An attempt to release excess space has been made for this data set, but the data set is\r\nnot eligible for partial release processing. The data set is a multi-volume data set that was created\r\nthrough space constraint relief processing and the high use RBA for the data set is not in the range\r\nof an extent on the last volume of the data set.\r\nSystem Action: The request to release the space is ignored.\r\n14 Explanation: Rounding for multi-cylinder unit (MCU) boundary prevented partial release of space.\r\nSystem Action: The request to release the space is ignored.\r\n18 Explanation: The primary volume RBAs are out of order for this multivolume partial release\r\nrequest. Correct, and rerun.\r\nProgrammer Response: Run IDCAMS DEFINE RECATALOG with the volumes in RBA order.\r\nRETURN CODE 182 Explanation: Bad DADSM UPDATE parameter list.\r\nReason Code Description\r\nx Explanation: Internal logic error.\r\nProgrammer Response: Contact the IBM Support center.\r\nRETURN CODE 184 Explanation: The data set is currently open and cannot be deleted or altered. This condition\r\narises when two different jobs are referencing the same VSAM data set simultaneously, or an attempt was made to\r\ndelete a pagespace that is currently active.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n0 Explanation: A rename is not allowed for an open data set. The backout has been done\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n2 Explanation: The data set is currently open to another user.\r\n4 Explanation: The data or index component (or both) is in use, and the data set cannot be deleted.\r\nProgrammer Response: Run the command again. To ensure proper completion, specify a\r\ndisposition parameter of OLD, not SHR.\r\n6 Explanation: The attempted DELETE or ALTER of a PAGESPACE, or attempted DELETE\r\nCATALOG FORCE that implicitly deletes a PAGESPACE, cannot be allowed. The pagespace is\r\ncurrently in use on this or another system sharing the volume that contains the pagespace.\r\nProgrammer Response: If a PAGESPACE is to be deleted or altered, it must not be in use by any\r\nsystem that shares the volume on which it is located.\r\n8 Explanation: The data set is in use by another job; this reason code usually means that a\r\nBackup-While-Open (BWO) dump of the data set is in progress.\r\nProgrammer Response: Run the requested function again after verifying the data set is not\r\ncurrently being dumped.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n10 Explanation: An attempt has been made to alter one of the attributes LOG, LOGSTREAMID, or\r\nBWO for a data set that is currently open.\r\nSystem Action: The request is terminated.\r\nProgrammer Response: Reissue the ALTER request when the target data set is not open.\r\nRETURN CODE 186 Explanation: Error attempting to lock a catalog or access a locked catalog.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n0 Explanation: Lock verification failed.\r\nProgrammer Response: An unauthorized caller attempted to access a locked catalog. To access a\r\nlocked catalog, a user must have read authority to the profile IGG.CATLOCK of class type\r\nFACILITY. Obtain the correct authorization. Run the job again.\r\n2 Explanation: Access was denied for one of the following reasons:\r\nv No profile IGG.CATLOCK of class type FACILITY was found\r\nv RACF, or an equivalent product, was not active\r\nv No MVS router exit was found\r\nProgrammer Response: Either define the profile IGG.CATLOCK, activate RACF, or supply an MVS\r\nrouter exit.\r\n4 Explanation: The caller was not authorized for DEFINE LOCK.\r\nProgrammer Response: To use the DEFINE LOCK command, a caller must have read authority to\r\nthe profile IGG.CATLOCK of class type FACILITY. Obtain the correct authorization. Run the job\r\nagain.\r\n6 Explanation: The caller was not authorized for ALTER LOCK.\r\nProgrammer Response: A caller attempted to issue either the ALTER LOCK command for an\r\nunlocked catalog, or the ALTER UNLOCK command for a locked catalog for which the caller was\r\nunauthorized. To use the ALTER LOCK and ALTER UNLOCK commands, a caller must have read\r\nauthority to the profile IGG.CATLOCK of class type FACILITY. Obtain the correct authorization.\r\nRun the job again.\r\nRETURN CODE 188 Explanation: As a catalog management return code:\r\nReason Code Description\r\n6 Explanation: The catalog is temporarily unavailable.\r\nProgrammer Response: Try the request again at a later time. If a COPY or IMPORT operation has\r\nfailed, do a DELETE RECOVERY and import a backup copy of the catalog.\r\nAs a volume error code: Catalog unavailable for the remainder of processing which establishes\r\nvolumes as candidates for future extension. This occurs during define of VSAM data sets only\r\nwhen another error is encountered during candidate processing. This code appears as a volume\r\nerror code for the volumes that are not processed due to the other error code which will appear in\r\nthe access method services jobstream output.\r\nRETURN CODE 190 Explanation: Authorization error on a facility class function applied to SMS data sets.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n0 Explanation: The function was ALTER BCS only.\r\n2 Explanation: The function was DIRECTED CATALOG.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n4 Explanation: The function was DEFINE NONVSAM with no BCS.\r\n6 Explanation: The function was DEFINE NONVSAM with no NVR.\r\n8 Explanation: The function was DELETE NVR with no BCS check.\r\n10 Explanation: The function was DELETE NOSCRATCH.\r\n12 Explanation: The function was DELETE GDG FORCE.\r\n14 Explanation: The function was ALTER UNCONVERT from SMS managed VSAM data set back to\r\nnon-SMS managed.\r\n16 Explanation: The user is not authorized to alter the storage class or management class of an\r\nSMS-managed data set.\r\nProgrammer Response: Insure that the user has read access authority to\r\n'STGADMIN.IGG.ALTER.SMS.\r\n18 Explanation: The user is not authorized to perform a ATL define, alter, or delete request.\r\nProgrammer Response: Insure that the user has read access authority to\r\n'STGADMIN.IGG.LIBRARY'.\r\nRETURN CODE 192 Explanation: Maximum logical record length specified is greater than 32,761 for a non-spanned\r\ndata set.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n0 Programmer Response: Reduce the maximum logical record length or define the data set as\r\nspanned.\r\nRETURN CODE 194 Explanation: An error occurred during multi-level alias (MLA) facility processing.\r\nReason Code Description\r\n8 Explanation: MLA was unavailable for the request.\r\nProgrammer Response: Enter the F CATALOG, MLA(REFRESH) or F CATALOG, RESTART\r\ncommand to re-enable the MLA.\r\n10 Explanation: MLA detected a damaged master catalog record.

The values indicate the\r\namounts that can be specified as if only 1 MB pages or only 2 GB pages will be requested; when both 1 MB and 2\r\nGB pages are requested, the sum of the requested amounts must not exceed the system limit.\r\nIf the xM, xG, xT,or x% syntax is used, the system limit is calculated by first taking 80% of the online real storage at\r\nIPL, and then subtracting 2G: ( 80% * online real storage at IPL )- 2G.Ifthe 1M=and 2G= syntax is used, the system\r\nlimit is calculated by first subtracting 4G from the online real storage at IPL, and then multiplying that by 80%:\r\n(online real storage at IPL \u2013 4GB)*80% . Message IAR043I is issued if the requested amount is greater than the system\r\nlimit.\r\nThe range of percentages is included to reflect the valid range of pages, but there can be percentage values within the\r\nrange that are between pages or less than a full page. Percentage requests are rounded down to the nearest 1 MB or 2\r\nGB page boundary, which results in a request for zero pages if the calculation is less than one page.

SKP was specified and either KEY was not specified or BWD was specified.\r\n2. BWD was specified for CNV processing.\r\n3. FWD and LRD were specified.\r\n4. Neither ADR, CNV, nor KEY was specified in the RPL.\r\n5. WRTBFR, MRKBFR, or SCHBER was issued was issued, but either TRANSID was greater than\r\n31 or the shared resource option was not specified.\r\n6. ICI processing was specified, but a request other than a GET or a PUT was issued.\r\n7. MRKBFR MARK=OUT or MARK=RLS was issued, but the RPL did not have a data buffer\r\nassociated with it.\r\n8. The RPL specified WAITX, but the ACB did not specify LSR or GSR.\r\n108 The RECLEN specified was larger than the maximum allowed, equal to 0, or smaller than the sum\r\nof the length and the displacement of the key field of the base cluster or related alternate index\r\n(AIX). The RECLEN was not equal to the slot size specified for a relative record data set.\r\n11 2 KEYLEN specified was too large or equal to 0.\r\n11 6 During initial data set loading (that is, when records are being stored in the data set the first time\r\nit's opened), GET, POINT, ERASE, direct PUT, and skip-sequential PUT with OPTCD=UPD are not\r\nallowed. During initial data set loading, VERIFY is not allowed except for an entry-sequenced data\r\nset (ESDS) defined with the RECOVERY option. For initial loading of a relative record data set, the\r\nrequest was other than a PUT insert.\r\n120 The request was operating under an incorrect TCB. For example, an end-of-volume call or a\r\nGETMAIN would have been necessary to complete the request, but the request was issued from a\r\njob step other than the one that opened the data set.

In the latter case, the control interval is\r\nincorrect for one of the following reasons:\r\n1. A key is not greater than the previous key.\r\n2. A key is not in the current control interval.\r\n3. A spanned record RDF is present.\r\n4. A free space pointer is incorrect.\r\n5. The number of records does not match a group RDF record count.\r\n6. A record definition field is incorrect.\r\n7.
