A MINIMUM OF 32767 IS REQUIRED.\r\nSystem action: The system enters a non-restartable X'0A3' wait state.\r\nOperator response: Inform the system programmer of the error. After the error condition has been relieved, reIPL\r\nthe system.\r\nSystem programmer response:\r\nv If IXLCONN failed with RC=C RSN=0C08, make sure that you do the system IPL with a CFRM policy that defines\r\nthe global resource serialization lock structure with sufficient connectivity to coupling facilities. See messages IXL013I and IXL015I for details on connect failures and on coupling facility status that prevents the use of GRS from allocating the lock structure. See IXC518I for details on coupling facility that is not connected to the system.  A CFRM policy must be started to allow the use of coupling facilities and the global resource serialization lock structure. To start a CFRM policy, either use the SETXCF START,POLICY,TYPE=CFRM,POLNAME=polname operator command or specify CFRMPOL( polname) in the COUPLExx parmlib member to do sysplex IPL.\r\nThis problem might occur during a sysplex-wide IPL after a hardware upgrade when a coupling facility cannot be\r\nused. The SETXCF command cannot be used because this is occurring during a sysplex-wide IPL. The CFRMPOL\r\nkeyword in the COUPLExx parmlib member is ineffective because a CFRM policy is already active in the CFRM\r\ncouple data sets. To recover from this problem, perform the following steps:\r\n1. Specify GRS=TRYJOIN in IEASYS or as a response to IEA101A. This allows the system to come up in the GRS\r\nring mode.\r\n2. Start a new CFRM policy, bring a new coupling facility online, or correct the size of the ISGLOCK structure to\r\ncorrect the problem that is keeping GRS from allocating the ISGLOCK structure.\r\nFor example, this problem can occur on a z/990 machine when the partition number of a coupling facility\r\ndefinition in the CFRM policy does not match the LPAR identifier of the coupling facility definition in the\r\nHMC Image Profile. In this case, correcting the CFRM policy (and starting that corrected policy) should correct\r\nthe problem and allow the coupling facility to be brought into use.\r\n3. Either re-IPL with the corrections, or issue SETGRS MODE=STAR to avoid the IPL.\r\n4. Start the remaining systems in GRS=STAR mode.\r\nv Make sure that the SIZE or INITSIZE specified in the CFRM policy for the global resource lock structure is\r\nsufficient for use by global resource serialization. If it is not, increase the size specified in the policy. If it is, update\r\nthe CFRM policy preference list to select a coupling facility that has sufficient storage. After updating the CFRM\r\npolicy, start the updated policy.\r\nv If IXLCONN failed with RC=C RSN=0C27, use the D XCF,STR,STRNAME=ISGLOCK operator command to\r\ndisplay detailed information about the ISGLOCK structure and its connectors.

For example, exclusive locks are used to protect update\r\noperations.\r\nv A lock is shared if it can have many holders.

Possible causes include:\r\nv A channel-to-channel link (CTC) between two global resource serialization systems failed.\r\nv A software error in global resource serialization processing on one of the global resource serialization systems.\r\nv The operator on one of the active global resource serialization systems stopped the system without first entering\r\nthe VARY GRS QUIESCE command.\r\nSystem action: All active global resource serialization systems, including this one, become inactive global resource\r\nserialization systems. An inactive global resource serialization system suspends any task that attempts to obtain or\r\nrelease global resources.\r\nThe system issues message ISG022E if a CTC failed or a software error occurred on one of the global resource\r\nserialization systems.\r\nEach system in the ring that specified RESTART=YES in its GRSDEF statement automatically enters the VARY\r\nGRS(ALL),RESTART command. However, only one of those systems actually performs the restart. The first system to\r\nreceive permission to rebuild the ring from more than half the systems that were in the ring is the system that does\r\nthe restart.\r\nWhen that system has received permission from more than half the systems that were in the ring, it becomes an\r\nactive global resource serialization system, issues message ISG024I, and attempts to rebuild the ring.\r\nThe system writes a logrec data set error record and an SVC dump.\r\nOperator response: If one of the systems is automatically rebuilding the global resource serialization ring and issues\r\nmessage ISG024I, allow automatic restart processing to complete. If any of the systems that were in the ring do not\r\nbecome active global resource serialization system, notify the system programmer.\r\nIf none of the systems issues message ISG24I to indicate that it is rebuilding the ring, do the following:\r\nv Before beginning recovery procedures, consult the system programmer and the operators on the other global\r\nresource serialization systems to coordinate recovery actions. Failure to coordinate recovery can cause resource\r\ndamage.\r\nv Enter the DISPLAY GRS command on as many systems as necessary to find out which global resource serialization\r\nsystems can communicate with other global resource serialization systems. If a system in the display has NO in the\r\nCOMM column, that system cannot communicate with the system where the command was entered.\r\nv Ask the system programmer to help choose which system to rebuild the ring from using the VARY\r\nGRS(ALL),RESTART command. Consider the following:\r\n\u2013 Do not enter the command on a system that is unable to communicate with other global resource serialization\r\nsystems unless you are rebuilding a ring with only two systems.\r\n\u2013 Wait until command processing completes before you enter the command again.\r\n\u2013 Wait until command processing completes on one system before entering the command on another system.\r\nSystem programmer response: If none of the systems that were in the global resource serialization ring start\r\nrebuilding the ring, help the operator choose the system to restart the ring from. Consider the following:\r\nv Choose the same system you would select if you could have only one active global resource serialization system.\r\nThen, if the RESTART is only partially successful and only the one system becomes active, that system could use\r\nboth the global resources it owned at the time of the error and the ones not owned by any system.\r\nv Choose the system that can communicate with the greatest number of other global resource serialization systems.\r\nIf the global resource serialization ring is rebuilt successfully, but one or more global resource serialization systems\r\ndo not become active global resource serialization systems, do the following for each of those systems:\r\n1. Make sure that the CTCs, including the alternate CTCs, the system was using for global resource serialization\r\nprocessing are enabled.\r\n2. Identify an active global resource serialization system that can communicate with the system that did not become\r\nactive. Ask the operator of the active system to enter the VARY GRS(sysname ),RESTART command, where sysname\r\nis the name of the active or quiesced system.\r\nIf the system's global resource serialization status is quiesced, you can also use the VARY GRS(*),RESTART\r\ncommand.\r\nIf the system becomes an active global resource serialization system when the VARY GRS RESTART command is\r\nprocessed, no further action is needed.\r\n3.

A sysplex may have multiple\r\nCFs and multiple CF cache structures.\r\nIn order to get the best performance for coupling facility (CF) caches, the cache structures should be\r\nlarge enough to hold the data that could be buffered on local systems plus the internal structures\r\nneeded to maintain the data.\r\nThe VSAM RLS recommendation, based on your current buffer pool values, is CacheMinSize MB.\r\nThis value was calculated using a 2K average CI size. Your current buffer pool is divided by the\r\naverage CI size to get the number of records to be cached. The optimal cache size is then calculated\r\nby multiplying the number of records to the size for each record in CF cache, which consists of a\r\ndata element and a directory element.

Since devices 0420-042F need\r\nspecial timing requirements, the installation specified an MIH time interval of 5 seconds and an I/O timing timeout\r\ninterval of 11 seconds. With an MIH time interval of 5 seconds and a HALT time interval of 5 seconds, recovery will\r\nusually complete prior to timing out with the I/O timeout interval. Because devices 0490-0493 have the MIH time\r\ninterval set to zero, the system turns off MIH processing for those devices. Because I/O timing DASD device class\r\nname, IOTDASD, is set to zero, all DASD devices, except those in user class US02, have I/O timing processing\r\nturned off.\r\nThe following example shows what the system may display when the operator enters a DISPLAY\r\nIOS,MIH,DEV=(0000-0010) command:\r\nIn this example, devices 0000, 0001, and 0009 do not exist. The MIH time interval for devices 0002-000F, which do\r\nexist, is 3 minutes and 0 seconds. For device 0010, the MIH time interval is 0 minutes and 15 seconds.\r\nThe following example shows what the system displays when the operator enters a DISPLAY IOS,MIH,TDEVX=(000-010) command:\r\nIn this example, devices 0000, 0001, and 0009 do not exist. The I/O timing timeout interval for device 0002 is 0\r\nminutes, 10 seconds. The I/O timing timeout intervals for devices 0003-0008 and 000A-000F is 0 minutes, 20 seconds.\r\nThe I/O timing timeout interval for device 0010 is 0 minutes, 15 seconds.\r\nThe following example shows what the system might display when the operator enters a DISPLAY command that\r\ncauses the number of returned output lines to exceed the maximum of 255 lines:\r\nSystem action: The system continues processing.\r\n IOS086I hh.mm.ss MIH DEVICE TIMES\r\n0002=03:00, 0003=03:00, 0004=03:00, 0005=03:00, 0006=03:00,\r\n0007=03:00, 0008=03:00, 000A=03:00, 000B=03:00, 000C=03:00,\r\n000D=03:00, 000E=03:00, 000F=03:00, 0010=00:15\r\n IOS086I hh.mm.ss IOT DEVICE TIMES\r\n0002=00:10, (0003-0008)=00:20, (000A-000F)=00:20, 0010=00:15.\r\n.\r\n0E89, 0E8A, 0E8B, 0E8C, 0E8D, 0E8E, 0E8F, 0E90,\r\n0E91, 0E92, 0E93, 0E94, 0E95, 0E96, 0E97, 0E98,\r\n...

This might have occurred due to a hardware\r\nmalfunction.\r\nIn the message text:\r\ncc The channel path causing the I/O timeouts.\r\nSystem action: The system purges the outstanding I/O requests and does not take any action on the channel path\r\nspecified in the message. If no external action is taken, timeouts might continue to occur for devices which use the\r\naffected channel path.\r\nOperator response: Contact the system programmer.\r\nSystem programmer response: If there are many devices attached to this channel path, you can take action to\r\nprevent the system from continuing to experience timeouts on this channel path. To do this, the channel path can be\r\nconfigured offline from the Hardware Management Console (HMC).\r\nNote: Be aware that configuring a channel path offline from the HMC at this time might have some adverse effects\r\non the system:\r\nv When a channel path is configured on or off via the HMC, the operating system might not be notified causing the\r\noperating system's (S/W) view of the channel path's state to be out of sync with the actual state (H/W). Therefore,\r\nas IPL continues after this point, there might be inconsistencies between hardware and software with respect to the\r\nchannel path causing possible software errors. You can use the D M=CHP( cc ) MVS operator command to\r\ndetermine if such inconsistencies are present.\r\nv In certain circumstances, there is a chance the console might become flooded with IOS error messages. One case\r\nwhere this might occur is when the last path to a set of devices is configured offline by the HMC.\r\nDue to these effects, a re-IPL should be done after action has been taken at the HMC to configure the faulty channel\r\npath. Note that as NIP path validation continues, timeouts as a result of other faulty channel paths might cause\r\nadditional IOS125I messages to be issued. Therefore, the re-IPL should be done when action has been taken to\r\naddress all faulty channel paths. As the channel paths are now offline, they will not be used for the re-IPL and will\r\nnot cause additional timeouts. If a re-IPL absolutely cannot be tolerated, it is possible to sync up the operating\r\nsystem's (S/W) view of the channel path with the actual state (H/W) of the channel path by issuing a CONFIG\r\nCHP(cc ),OFFLINE MVS operator command after IPL has completed and MVS is ready to accept commands.\r\nHowever, take note that allowing the system to continue to IPL at this point may result in software errors during IPL\r\ndue to the inconsistencies explained in the note above.\r\nYou should determine the cause of the hardware problem. If an IPL is needed prior to fixing the problem, keep the\r\nproblematic CHPID out of the configuration, or ensure it is offline prior to IPL.\r\nNote: In all other circumstances, IBM strongly recommends that you use the operating system facilities, when fully\r\navailable, rather than the Hardware Management Console to configure channel paths on and off.

Any attempt to access these records results in a LOCKEDresponse\r\nbeing returned to the application. To preserve data integrity, the records must remain locked until the backout has\r\nbeen successfully retried.\r\nIf the backout fails again when it is retried, DFSMSdfp does not reissue this message.

The severity of its impact depends on whether the backout can be successfully retried. If the reason and\r\nreturn codes or failure code in the message text indicates that an unexpected error occurred, it might be due to\r\ncorruption of storage or an error within DFSMStvs code. It might also indicate an error within VSAM. For\r\ninformation on VSAM diagnostics, see z/OS DFSMSdfp Diagnosis .\r\nA lock error indicates that backout processing encountered aLOCKEDresponse while attempting to acquire a lock on a\r\nrecord on which another unit of recovery holds a retained lock. If this error occurs, it might indicate an error in the\r\nSMSVSAM server. For assistance, contact the IBM Support Center.\r\nA timeout error indicates that backout processing has timed out while attempting to acquire a lock. If this error\r\noccurs, it might indicate an error in the SMSVSAM server. For assistance, contact the IBM Support Center.\r\nYou might decide to leave the data set online for any of these errors, especially if you think that the backout failure\r\ncould have been due to a temporary situation and that the backout might succeed if retried. You can retry the\r\nbackout by using the SHCDS RETRY command. As a last resort, and at the cost of losing data integrity, you can\r\nbypass the deferred backout of uncommitted changes to this data set by using the SHCDS PURGE command.\r\nMany return and reason code combinations are possible. For descriptions of the return and reason codes, seez/OS\r\nDFSMStvs Administration Guide. A few, specific error situations follow:\r\n1. The data set ran out of space. Reallocate the data set with more space, and then retry the backout by using the\r\nSHCDS RETRY command. Do not forward recover the data set.\r\n2. An I/O error occurred. It is possible that the data set needs to be restored, especially if a large number of these\r\nmessages have referred to the same data set or if I/O errors have been issued during request processing for the\r\ndata set. If you decide to restore the data set, take the following steps:\r\na. Prevent access to the data set by quiescing it, using the VARY SMS command.\r\nb. Restore a backup copy and forward recover the data set.\r\nc. Reallow access to the data set by unquiescing it.\r\nd. Retry deferred backouts by using the SHCDS RETRY command.\r\n3. A DFSMSdss non-backup-while-open backup is in progress for the data set. The backout is shunted and will be\r\nretried either automatically or by use of the IDCAMS SHCDS command when the backup completes.\r\n4. A failure of the VSAM RLS server was detected, or the server is currently unavailable. DFSMStvs restart\r\nprocessing automatically retries the backout when the server becomes available again.\r\n5. The VSAM RLS cache structure to which the data set was bound either failed or lost connectivity, and VSAM has\r\nbeen unable either to rebuild the failed cache structure or to bind the data set to an alternative cache structure in\r\nthe cache set. The backout is shunted and can be retried by using the IDCAMS SHCDS command when the cache\r\nstructure becomes available again.\r\n6. VSAM returned a response indicating that the RLS lock structure in the coupling facility is full. Allocate a larger\r\nlock structure, rebuild into it, and retry the backout by using the SHCDS RETRY command. See z/OS MVS Setting\r\nUp a Sysplex and z/OS DFSMSdfp Storage Administrationfor further information on how to allocate and build into\r\nlarger lock structures.\r\n7. There was no space to add another alternate key value to a non-unique alternate index. Rebuild the data set with\r\na larger alternate index data control interval (CI) size (unless you are already at the maximum), and then retry the\r\nbackout by using the SHCDS RETRY command. Do not forward recover the data set.\r\n8. An error occurred in opening the data set for backout. Determine why the data set could not be opened. If\r\npossible, correct the problem, and then issue the SHCDS RETRY command to retry the backout.\r\n9. An unexpected error occurred during backout. Message IGW10102I is issued and a memory dump is created; use\r\nthese to determine the cause of the error. You can also retry the backout, using the SHCDS RETRY command,\r\nbecause the problem could have been due to a temporary condition that has since cleared.\r\nProblem determination: None\r\nSource: DFSMSdfp\r\nModule: IGW8RIOM\r\nRouting code: 11\r\nDescriptor code: -", "ISG221I": " text\r\nExplanation: In the message, text is:\r\nSUMMARY FOR RNL CHANGE\r\nSYSTEMsysname1\r\nj1RESOURCE REQUESTS DELAYING RNL CHANGE.\r\nj2JOBS SUSPENDED UNTIL RNL CHANGE COMPLETES.\r\nSYSTEMsysname2\r\n.\r\nA summary of a pending resource name list (RNL) change was requested in response to message ISG220D.

Global resource serialization does not permit systems to\r\njoin the global resource serialization complex while an RNL change is in progress.\r\nSystem action: The JOIN will not be processed until the RNL change completes.\r\nOperator response: If it is important that system sysname join the complex, cancel the RNL change. If the RNL\r\nchange is more important, wait for it to complete.\r\nMake sure that the joining system specifies the RNLs being used in the complex when it actually joins. For example:\r\nv If you cancel the SET GRSRNL command, the joining system should specify the RNLs that were in use before the\r\ncommand was entered.\r\nv If you allow the SET GRSRNL command to complete, make sure the joining system uses the RNLs that will be in\r\nplace after the command completes.\r\nSource: Global resource serialization\r\nModule: ISGCART\r\nRouting code: 2,10\r\nDescriptor code: 4", "ISG303D": " GRS=STAR NOT ALLOWED WHEN SYSTEM IN xcfmode MODE.

It can be one of the\r\nfollowing:\r\nNO I/O OPERATION IS IN PROGRESS\r\nThe device does not know about this I/O operation. This can occur for one of the following reasons:\r\nv The I/O operation was lost in transit to the device.\r\nv The I/O operation ended just before the device was queried to determine the state.\r\nI/O OPERATION IS EXECUTING\r\nThe I/O operation is currently active for this device. This might occur for a long running channel program.\r\nI/O WAITING FOR I/O OPER FROM ANOTHER SYSTEM\r\nThe I/O operation is delayed because it is waiting for the completion of another I/O operation (other than a\r\ndevice reserve) from another system.\r\nI/O WAITING FOR EXTENT CONFLICT\r\nThe I/O operation is delayed because it is attempting to access a DASD extent that is in use by another I/O\r\noperation.\r\nI/O WAITING FOR DEVICE DEPENDENT OPERATION\r\nThe I/O operation is delayed because it is waiting for completion of a device dependent operation. For example,\r\ndata needs to be staged into the cache from disk.\r\nDEVICE RESERVED BY ANOTHER SYSTEM\r\nThe I/O operation is delayed because the device is reserved by another system. Message IOS431I is also issued\r\nto identify the system holding the reserve.\r\nDEVICE RESERVED TO THIS SYSTEM\r\nThe I/O operation is delayed because the device is reserved to this system on one or more channel paths for the\r\ndevice, but the I/O operation used a different path.

When the system determines that there is a\r\nperformance problem with a path, it will direct I/Os away from that path. This action, taken by the system to correct\r\nthe performance problem, results in inconsistent I/O rates across the paths.\r\nEach of the control units in the report had a total I/O rate across all channel paths that exceeded the THRESHOLD\r\nparameter value, and had at least one path whose I/O rate was significantly lower (as defined by the RATIO\r\nparameter value) than the rate for the path with the highest I/O rate. That is, the I/O rate for the path with the\r\nhighest I/O rate was at least 'ratio' times higher than that of the lowest I/O rate for this control unit. This may\r\nhappen when there is a problem somewhere in the fabric, such as, hardware errors, I/O mis-configurations, or\r\ncongestion. Each of the paths identified with the lower I/O rates should be further examined to determine the source\r\nof the problem.\r\nFor example, with a THRESHOLD value of 100 I/Os per second and a RATIO value of 2, this message will be issued\r\nwhen at least one control unit in the system had a total I/O rate for all of its channels exceeding 100 I/Os per\r\nsecond, and there was one or more paths with an I/O rate less than half that of the path with the highest I/O rate.\r\nNote:\r\nv If parameters have recently been changed, this result may be based on previously defined parameters.

The Host error recovery procedures may be down-level or the error could be due\r\nto a microcode problem.\r\nUNABLE TO OBTAIN SENSE DATA FROM THE DEVICE\r\nFor some tape drives, a two-line message is issued if there was a unit check but IOS was unable to obtain sense\r\ndata from the device.\r\nREQUEST TERMINATED, EXCESSIVE RETRIES\r\nDASD ERP has a loop detector to prevent an infinite number of ERP entries. If a count of 2048 retries is detected,\r\nthe I/O request is terminated with a permanent error indication.\r\nLIMITED SHARED ACCESS VIOLATION\r\nThe device has the Limited Shared Access Facility enabled at the control unit. While the device was in use by\r\nanother host operating system, a tape motion command which could have compromised data integrity was\r\nissued to the device by the current host operating system. The current host's tape motion command is rejected. If\r\nthis command had been issued by an application job step, it would normally result in an abend of the step. The\r\njob on the first host will continue without disruption until an unload occurs or a new tape is loaded, or the first\r\nhost loses all paths to the device or varies the device offline. This violation may occur when the device sharing is\r\nmanaged via software which bypasses control unit assists.\r\nVOLUME IS NOT FORMATTED\r\nA read-type command was issued to a tape which has not been formatted for read-type operations. The tape\r\nmight be blank or written in a format that the device cannot recognize.\r\nENCRYPTION FAILURE CU=XX DRIVE=XXXXXX EKM=XXXXXX\r\nIf an encryption-related key exchange between the drive and the key manager fails, an IOS000I message is issued\r\nindicating that an encryption failure has occurred. The control unit (CU), DRIVE, and Encryption Key Manager\r\n(EKM) error codes are from sense bytes 08, 13-15, and 17-19 respectively. For an EKM failure, see the Problem\r\nDetermination section of the IBM System Storage\r\n\u00ae\r\nTape Encryption Key Manager, Introduction, Planning, and User's\r\nGuide, GA76-0418. When looking up the EKM failure, use the last four byes of the error code. For a control unit\r\n(CU) failure, see the IBM System Storage TS1130 Tape Drive and TS1120 Tape Drive and Controller Operator Guide,\r\nGA32-0556. For more detailed information about the drive-reported conditions, and also about the EKM-reported\r\nconditions, see the Problem Determination section of the IBM System Storage TS3500 Tape Library Operator Guide ,\r\nGA32-0560.\r\nFor more information, see z/OS DFSMS Software Support for IBM System Storage TS1140, TS1130, and TS1120 Tape\r\nDrives (3592), SC26-7514.\r\nIMMEDIATE MODE COPY[EXPECTED|UNEXPECTED] FAILUREREASON CODE = ZZCOPY COUNTXX OF YY COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY\r\nAt lease one required Immediate Mode Copy for the volume could not be completed.

IOS boxes the alias to prevent WLM from\r\ncontinuously selecting this same Alias to be moved.\r\nDEFERRED BOX PROCESSING COMPLETE\r\nThe system deferred its box processing in order to allow recovery processing to run. Certain recovery processing,\r\nsuch as HyperSwap operations, may be able to provide continuous availability to the device by swapping the\r\nfaulty device (that is, the primary device) with a fully operation \"backup\" device (that is, the secondary device)\r\nprior to permanently boxing the faulty device.\r\nSystem action: One of the following:\r\nv If the system can no longer use the device, it forces the device offline.\r\nv If the device is reserved, the system tries to release it.\r\nv If the device is assigned, the system tries to unassign it.\r\nv The system boxes the device, as follows:\r\n\u2013 The I/O on the device is ended.\r\n\u2013 Any new I/O requests result in permanent I/O errors.\r\n\u2013 The system does not perform new allocations for the device.\r\n\u2013 If the device was online, the system marks it pending offline. A pending offline device goes offline when the\r\nfollowing conditions occur, in this order:\r\n1. The device is no longer allocated to any job.\r\n2. Allocation can get the necessary resources to process the request.\r\n\u2013 If the device was offline, it remains offline.\r\nOperator response: If the message text ends with OPERATOR REQUEST or PERMANENT ERROR, and the\r\ndevice has a dismountable volume, move the volume to an online device.\r\nOtherwise, do one of the following:\r\nv If the system forced the device offline, do the following:\r\n\u2013 Consult your installation's operating procedures.\r\n\u2013 Enter a VARY DEVICE ONLINE command to bring the device online. Wait for the device to go entirely offline\r\nbefore doing so.\r\n\u2013 Contact hardware support.\r\nv If the system boxed the device, recover the device as follows:\r\n1. Vary the boxed device offline to all sharing systems.\r\n2. Isolate the failing control unit for repair.\r\n3. Determine the range of affected devices.\r\n4. Contact hardware support.\r\n5. Bring the device online to allow hardware support personnel to verify the data on the boxed device. Do one of\r\nthe following:\r\n\u2013 Enter a DISPLAY UNITS command to see if the device is one of the following:\r\n- Offline and boxed (F-BOX)\r\n- Allocated and boxed (A-BOX)\r\n\u2013 If the device is offline and boxed, vary the device online by entering the following command:\r\nVA R Y dev,ONLINE\r\n\u2013 If the device is allocated and boxed, display the using job steps that are allocated to the device by entering\r\nthe following command:\r\nDISPLAY U,,ALLOC,dev,1\r\nFollow your installation's procedures for unallocating using job steps.\r\nVary the device offline, using the following command:\r\nVA R Y dev,OFFLINE\r\nVary the device online, using the following command:\r\nVA R Y dev,ONLINE\r\n\u2013 Verify the data on the volume.\r\n6.

If CTC dev was in use at the time the error occurred, the global resource\r\nserialization ring might be disrupted.\r\nThe system writes messages in the system logs (SYSLOG) of all active global resource serialization systems and of\r\nany systems that are restarting or joining the global resource serialization complex. The system might write a logrec\r\ndata set error record and an ABEND dump.\r\nFor return code X'10', the device is not varied offline so that the system can detect when paths become available\r\nd1\r\nd1\r\nagain. Like other hardware errors this may result in a ring disruption. The system will utilize the device once the\r\npaths are restored.\r\nOperator response: If this message is accompanied by message IOS071I indicating a missing channel and device\r\nend, then notify the system programmer.\r\nIf the message text indicates a hardware error and the reason code is X'05' or X'07', the problem might be caused by\r\nanother system in the global resource serialization ring. With the reason code of X'05', the problem might be caused\r\nby the device being configured as an SCTC, which GRS cannot use. If the message text indicates a hardware error\r\nand the reason code is X'0B', the configuration might be wrong. Make sure that all required channels are varied\r\nonline and that your system was initialized with the correct GRSCNF parameter.\r\nFor other occurrences of message ISG046E, contact hardware support.\r\nAfter the hardware error is corrected, enter a VARYdev,ONLINE command to make the CTC enabled for use by\r\nglobal resource serialization.\r\nFor other reason codes, notify the system programmer.\r\nSystem programmer response: If the reason code is X'05', check to see if the device is configured as a BCTC. If the\r\ndevice is configured as a SCTC, GRS cannot use it. If possible, try to reconfigure the device as a BCTC.\r\nIf this message is accompanied by message IOS071I indicating a missing channel and device end, check for correct\r\nspecification of MIH value for the CTC device. If this value is correct, the problem is caused by a system failure of\r\nanother system in the global resource serialization ring such as disabled spin loop, wait state, or machine check.\r\nInvestigate the cause of the failure of the other system. If the error recurs and the program is not in error, search\r\nproblem reporting databases for a fix for the problem. If no fix exists, contact the IBM Support Center.

TRANSACTIONAL VSAM WILL\r\nPERFORM LOST LOCKS RECOVERY\r\nExplanation: One or more data sets were open in DFSMStvs access mode when a failure of the coupling facility lock\r\nstructure occurred. SMSVSAM was not able to recover coupling facility lock structure failure. As a result, the locks\r\nheld by DFSMStvs for those data sets have been lost. VSAM record-level sharing (RLS) informed DFSMStvs that one\r\nor more data sets are in a lost locks state, and DFSMStvs must perform lost locks recovery for those data sets. On a\r\nDFSMStvs cold start, if there are any data sets with lost locks status, that status is cleared in that instance of\r\nDFSMStvs.\r\nSystem action: The data sets with lost locks status are marked as being unavailable for general use. New units of\r\nrecovery that attempt to access these data sets will fail.\r\nDFSMStvs performs lost locks recovery for the data sets. For each data set, this involves waiting until all units of\r\nrecovery that made uncommitted updates to the data set have completed. These units of recovery can access the data\r\nset for DFSMStvs to perform recovery on their behalf. When DFSMStvs completes lost locks recovery for a data set, it\r\nreports this fact to VSAM RLS. When all resource managers that had been accessing the data set have completed\r\ntheir lost locks recovery, the data set is made available for general use. A data set becomes available for general use\r\nas soon as its lost locks recovery has been completed; it does not have to wait for all data sets to be recovered.\r\nOperator response: None\r\nSystem programmer response: Lost locks recovery normally completes automatically without requiring any action\r\nfrom the user.

It can be one of the following:\r\nMISSING CHANNEL AND DEVICE END or MISSING DEVICE END\r\nA hardware error occurred.\r\nSTART PENDING\r\nA hardware error occurred. The channel has an I/O request to process. The device is not active or it is busy\r\non another channel path interface. If the device is reserved by another system, message IOS431I might\r\nfollow; it identifies the system holding the reserve.\r\nIf message IOS431I is issued, the system routes the D U,VOL and then the D GRS,DEV commands to the\r\nfailing system to identify the jobs holding the reserve. It identifies the jobs in message ISG020I if:\r\nv The failing system is in the sysplex\r\nv The failing system responds to the D GRS command within 30 seconds\r\nv No other system is attempting this at the same time.\r\nIDLE WITH WORK QUEUED\r\nA hardware or software error occurred. The channel has no active I/O requests.\r\nHALT SUBCHANNEL INTERRUPT MISSING\r\nCLEAR SUBCHANNEL INTERRUPT MISSING\r\nA hardware error occurred.\r\nHYPERSWAP INITIATED TIMEOUT\r\nA HyperSwap was in progress. MIH detects this condition and immediately times out any active I/O for\r\nany device being swapped. The I/O request is cancelled and requeued for later execution once the swap is\r\ncomplete.\r\nstatustext\r\nThe state of the I/O operation prior to detecting the missing interruption condition. It can be one of the\r\nfollowing:\r\nNO I/O OPERATION IS IN PROGRESS\r\nThe device does not know about this I/O operation. This can occur for one of the following reasons:\r\nv The I/O operation was lost in transit to the device.\r\nv The I/O operation ended just before the device was queried to determine the state.\r\nI/O OPERATION IS EXECUTING\r\nThe I/O operation is currently active for this device. This might occur for a long running channel program.\r\nI/O WAITING FOR I/O OPER FROM ANOTHER SYSTEM\r\nThe I/O operation is delayed because it is waiting for the completion of another I/O operation (other than a\r\ndevice reserve) from another system.\r\nI/O WAITING FOR EXTENT CONFLICT\r\nThe I/O operation is delayed because it is attempting to access a DASD extent that is in use by another I/O\r\noperation.\r\nI/O WAITING FOR DEVICE DEPENDENT OPERATION\r\nThe I/O operation is delayed because it is waiting for completion of a device dependent operation. For example,\r\ndata needs to be staged into the cache from disk.\r\nDEVICE RESERVED BY ANOTHER SYSTEM\r\nThe I/O operation is delayed because the device is reserved by another system. Message IOS431I is also issued\r\nto identify the system holding the reserve.\r\nDEVICE RESERVED TO THIS SYSTEM\r\nThe I/O operation is delayed because the device is reserved to this system on one or more channel paths for the\r\ndevice, but the I/O operation used a different path. This occurs during a path group out of synch condition,\r\nwhere some online paths are in the path group and some are not. Recovery will be performed to correct this\r\ncondition.\r\nDEVICE RESERVED\r\nThe I/O operation is delayed because the device is reserved. This message is issued when z/OS is running as a\r\nguest under VM and it is unable to determine whether the current system or another system holds the reserve.\r\nDEVICE IS LONG BUSY\r\nThe I/O operation is delayed because the device is in a long busy state.\r\nDEVICE RECOVERY IS IN PROGRESS\r\nThe I/O operation is delayed because device recovery is in progress. For example, a disk drive failed and RAID\r\nrecovery is in progress to reconstruct the data.\r\nCONTROL UNIT IS BUSY\r\nThe I/O operation is delayed because the control unit is busy.\r\nCONTROL UNIT RECOVERY IS IN PROGRESS\r\nThe I/O operation is delayed because control unit recovery is in progress.\r\nSystem action: The system action depends on the message text. It is one of the following:\r\nMISSING CHANNEL AND DEVICE END\r\nMISSING DEVICE END\r\nThe system issues a Clear Subchannel (CSCH) instruction to reset the device.\r\nSTART PENDING\r\nIf status text is present and indicates that the device is reserved to another system, the I/O operation is allowed\r\nto continue, and the system issues message IOS431I, identifying the system holding the reserve.\r\nOtherwise, the system resets the device and restarts the I/O request.\r\nIDLE WITH WORK QUEUED\r\nThe system resets the device and passes an I/O request to the channel.\r\nHALT SUBCHANNEL INTERRUPT MISSING\r\nThe system does not reset the device.\r\nCLEAR SUBCHANNEL INTERRUPT MISSING\r\nThe system does no further processing on the device until a clear subchannel interruption occurs.\r\nHYPERSWAP INITIATED TIMEOUT\r\nThe system cancels the I/O and requeues it so the HyperSwap can proceed.\r\nOperator response: Depending on the message text, do one of the following:\r\nMISSING DEVICE END\r\nDo the following:\r\nv Check the device for hardware problems. Look for the SELECT light on for a tape drive. Check if the SELECT\r\nLOCK is on for a disk device. Check for proper connections to control and switching units.\r\nv If you just finished rewinding a tape or mounting a volume, enter a VARY dev,ONLINE command to generate\r\na simulated device end. Do not issue the VARY dev,ONLINE command under other circumstances; it could\r\ndamage data on the device.\r\nv If you did not just finish rewinding a tape or mounting a volume, cancel the jobs that are using the device.\r\nSTART PENDING\r\nDo the following:\r\nv Determine whether the affected devices are reserved for the failing system.\r\nv Perform the recovery procedures defined by your installation.\r\nNote: If no devices are reserved for the failing system, resetting the reserves may cause integrity problems.\r\nv If the system is in a check stop state or restartable wait state, initiate an interface reset from the system console\r\nof the nonoperational system.\r\nv If the interface reset is unsuccessful, initiate a system reset from the system console of the nonoperational\r\nsystem.\r\nv Notify the system programmer.\r\nIDLE WITH WORK QUEUED\r\nIf the system issued message IOS075E, notify the system programmer.\r\nHYPERSWAP INITIATED TIMEOUT\r\nA HyperSwap is in progress.

The primary member,\r\nhowever, was NOT successfully processed because it conflicted with a member or an alias name in the output data\r\nset and replace was not specified for that primary member. Replacing and/or renaming of the copied alias may have\r\noccurred also. Form 1 applies only when the primary member was specified with a new (renamed) name, but was\r\nnot copied due to no-replace. Form 1 may appear combined with form 2 (alias rename); additionally it may be\r\ncombined with any one of forms 3-8 (replacement). Finally, it must be combined with one of the forms 9-11 (new\r\nprimary identification).\r\nForm 2applies only when the alias was renamed; it may appear combined with form 1 (primary rename), and may\r\nalso be combined with any one of forms 3-8 (replacement). Finally, it must be combined with one of the forms 9-11\r\n(new primary identification).\r\nForms 3-8 apply only when the alias name replaces a member name or another alias name in the output data set.\r\nThese forms tell the nature of that replacement. They may appear combined with Form 1 (primary rename), or with\r\nForm 2 (alias rename), or with both Forms 1 and 2. Finally, they must be combined with one of the forms 9-11 (new\r\nprimary identification).\r\nForm 3applies when the aliasnamereplaced a primary member name in the output data set. That primary had no\r\naliases. The replaced primary is no longer available in the output data set.\r\nForm 4applies when the aliasnamereplaced a primary member name in the output data set which did have aliases.\r\nThe replaced primary is no longer available. Any aliases for this replaced primary which are also replaced in the\r\noutput data set (by any alias or member from the input data set) will be identified in the message for the member or\r\nalias which replaced it. If any aliases of the replaced primary were not replaced, they will be identified in messages\r\nwhich appear somewhere prior to this one. If the output data set is a PDSE, any not-replaced aliases will be deleted.\r\nIf the output is a PDS, they will not be deleted.\r\nForm 5applies only when the output data set is a PDS which had a very rare, incorrect data situation: there was\r\nanother member with the same TTR number as the replaced member, but neither was identified in its directory entry\r\nas an alias.\r\nForm 6applies when the alias replaced an alias name of a correct member which WAS NOT replaced.\r\nForm 7applies when the alias replaced an alias name of a correct member which WAS replaced. However, the\r\nreplaced member was not replaced by the primary pname specified in this message. It was replaced by some other\r\nprimary or alias namername .\r\nForm 8applies only when the output data set is a PDS which had an incorrect data situation which can occasionally\r\noccur in a PDS with aliases. The alias replaced an alias name, but there was no correct primary for that alias. The\r\nsituation may have been created in the past during a copy operation if the primary was replaced, but the alias was\r\nnot (such as form 4 of this message).\r\nForms 9-11, one of which is always required for this message, can appear alone or in combination with forms 1, 2\r\nand 3-8. Forms 9-11 describes the new primary in the output data set (since the old primary was not copied). If\r\nspecific names were identified to be copied (rather than the entire data set), then the first successfully copied name in\r\na group of alias names in the order specified became the new primary. If specific names were not identified (and the\r\nentire data set was being copied), then the first successfully copied name in a group of alias names in collating\r\nsequence became the new primary. Form 9 applies when the alias named first in this message became the new\r\nprimary.\r\nForm 10 applies when another alias became the new primary and was NOT renamed during the copy operation.\r\nForm 11 applies when another alias became the new primary and WAS renamed during the copy operation.\r\nIn the message text:\r\nform The specified form that applies to the message.\r\nname The specified alias name.\r\npname The specified primary name.\r\nSystem action: Processing of the current request continues.\r\nOperator response: Verify that the results are as intended.\r\nSource: DFSMSdfp and File and Attribute Management Services.\r\nRouting code: 11\r\nDescriptor code: 6", "ISGH0308I": " No exit performance issues were detected.\r\nExplanation: Check successful.\r\nSystem action: N/A\r\nOperator response: N/A\r\nSystem programmer response: N/A\r\nProblem determination: N/A\r\nSource: N/A\r\nModule: ISGHCGRS, ISGHCMSG\r\nRouting code: N/A\r\nDescriptor code: N/A", "IGW01588W": " ( form 1 ) ALIAS nameOF NOT-SPECIFIED PRIMARY pname WILL NOT BE {COPIED | LOADED} DUE TO NO-REPLACE or(form 2 ) ALIAS nameOF NOT-SPECIFIED PRIMARY pname WILL NOT BE {COPIED | LOADED} AND RENAMED FROM rname DUE TO NO-REPLACE\r\nExplanation: The alias name indicated was not copied because an existing member or alias of the same names\r\nalready exists in the output data set.
