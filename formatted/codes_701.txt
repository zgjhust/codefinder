ISO/ANSI tape labels are not valid for 7-track drives. Correct the\r\nLABEL or UNIT parameter, or both, in the DD statement.\r\n0C A buffer length of 0 was specified for a BDAM data set for which dynamic buffering was requested. Correct\r\nthe data control block (DCB) by specifying a valid buffer length.\r\n10 An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a dummy data set; the BLKSIZE and BUFL values are both 0.\r\nCorrect the DCB by specifying a BLKSIZE or BUFL value other than 0.\r\n14 One of the following problems occurred:\r\nv An OPEN macro instruction was issued with OUTPUT or OUTIN specified. The DCB specifies\r\nDSORG=PO or POU, but the data set control block (DSCB) indicates that the data set is not partitioned.\r\nTake one of these actions to correct the problem:\r\n\u2013 Change the DCB macro instruction DSORG subparameter to PS.\r\n\u2013 Delete and recreate the data set and imply partitioned organization by allocating space for the directory\r\nin the SPACE parameter of the DD statement.\r\n\u2013 Verify that the values of the DSNAME and VOLUME parameters in the DD statement are correct.\r\nv An OPEN macro instruction was issued with INPUT specified. The DSCB indicates that the DSORG value\r\nis PO, but the DCB specifies neither DSORG=POnor DSORG=PS.\r\n18 An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a partitioned data set. The DSNAME parameter specified a\r\nmember that could not be found.\r\n1C An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a partitioned data set, but an I/O error occurred during a search\r\nof the directory.\r\n20 An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a sequential data set using queued access. BLKSIZE is not a\r\nmultiple of LRECL, or LRECL is 0 withRECFM=FBor RECFM=FBS, or BLKSIZE is not at least four bytes greater\r\nthan LRECL with RECFM=V.\r\n24 An OPEN macro instruction was issued with INPUT, INOUT, RDBACK, or UPDATE specified, but the DCB\r\ndid not specify a MACRF value of EXCP, GET, or READ.\r\n28 An OPEN macro instruction was issued with OUTPUT, OUTIN, OUTINX, or EXTEND specified, but the\r\nDCB did not specify a MACRF value of EXCP, PUT, or WRITE.\r\n2C A sequential data set using queued access with exchange buffering was opened for input, and the buffer\r\ncontrol-block address was 0. Verify that DCBBUFCB was not incorrectly modified. This type of error often\r\noccurs if two or more tasks share a DCB or if the DCB is opened and closed several times within one job\r\nstep.\r\n30 A sequential data set using the queued access technique with exchange buffering was opened for output, but\r\nthe buffer control-block address is 0. Verify that DCBBUFCB was not incorrectly modified. This type of error\r\noften occurs if a DCB is shared or is opened and closed several times within one job step.\r\n34 The system detected one of these conditions:\r\nv The following combination was specified: QSAM, MACRF=GD or PD, and a RECFM value that is not VS,\r\nVBS, DS, or DBS.\r\nv An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a data set with BLKSIZE and BUFL equal to 0. The system\r\ndetermined that it had to obtain buffers but was unable to do so.\r\nv RECFM was specified with both the A and M attributes.\r\nv The following combination was specified: QSAM, LRECL=0, and a RECFM value that is not V or VB.\r\nv The following combination was specified: RECFM=V or VB and LRECL greater than the quantity\r\nBLKSIZE minus 4.\r\nv The following combination was specified: QSAM and BLKSIZE=0. No nonzero BLKSIZE value was\r\navailable from any source and the system could not determine one. Coding BLKSIZE=0 in the JCL never\r\nhas an effect except when overriding a cataloged procedure variable.\r\nv The following combination was specified: RECFM not variable or undefined and LRECL greater than\r\nBLKSIZE.\r\nv The following combination was specified: BFTEK=A, RECFM=VBS, and LRECL=0.\r\n38 An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a sequential data set on a direct access device with track\r\noverflow, but the buffer control block address was zero. Verify that DCBBUFCB was not incorrectly\r\nmodified. This type of error often occurs if a DCB is reused or is opened and closed several times within\r\none job step.\r\n3C A sequential data set was opened for INPUT, OUTPUT, or EXTEND, but the next available buffer address in\r\nthe buffer control block was 0. Verify that DCBBUFCB was not incorrectly modified. This type of error often\r\noccurs if a DCB is reused or is opened and closed several times within one job step.\r\n40 A sequential or direct data set was opened for INPUT, but the next available buffer address in the buffer\r\ncontrol block was 0. Verify that DCBBUFCB was not incorrectly modified. This type of error often occurs if a\r\nDCB is reused or is opened and closed several times within one job step.\r\n44 An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a data set on a direct access device for which chained\r\nscheduling was specified, but the next available buffer address in the buffer control block was 0. Verify that\r\nDCBBUFCB was not incorrectly modified. This type of error often occurs if a DCB is reused or is opened\r\nand closed several times within one job step.\r\n48 An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a sequential data set using the queued access techniques, but the\r\nnext available buffer address in the buffer control block was 0. This means the DCB has an existing buffer\r\npool that does not have enough available buffers.\r\n4C An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a data set using queued access. The system determined that a\r\nbuffer pool existed for this data set and checked the buffer length value as follows, detecting an error:\r\nv If the data was to be sent directly to a unit record device (no spooling), the buffer length value in the\r\nbuffer control block had to be equal to or greater than the value specified in the DCB for LRECL. This\r\ntype of error often occurs if a DCB is shared by two or more tasks or is opened or closed several times\r\nwithin one job step.\r\nv Otherwise, the buffer length value in the buffer control block or in DCBBUFL had to be equal to or\r\ngreater than the value specified in the data control block extension (DCBE) or DCB for BLKSIZE.\r\n50 An OPEN macro instruction issued for a data set allocated to a printer did not have OUTPUT specified as\r\nan OPEN option.\r\n58 An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a paper-tape data set, but concatenation with unlike attributes\r\nwas specified; that is, the DCBOFLGS bit 4 was 1. Set the DCBOFLGS bit 4 to 0 and do not attempt to\r\nconcatenate a data set on paper tape with data sets of unlike attributes.\r\n5C One of the following events occurred:\r\nv An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a sequential data set using queued access. The data set\r\ncontained spanned variable-length records larger than 32 756, but GET locate mode was not specified, or\r\nthe logical record interface (LRI) and LRECL= x were both specified.\r\nv An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a sequential data set with the DCB specifying BFTEK=A\r\nlogical record interface and MACRF=GM or MACRF=PM.\r\n60 An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a data set with the DCB specifying RECFM=F, but the BLKSIZE\r\nvalue was not equal to LRECL. Correct the DCB parameters to specify RECFM=FB, or make LRECL and\r\nBLKSIZE equal.\r\n64 An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a dummy data set using an access method other than QSAM or\r\nBSAM. Correct the DD statement to specify a real data set, or access the data set using BSAM or QSAM.\r\n68 An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a data set for which the DCB or DCBE specified a block size and\r\nkey length whose sum is greater than the maximum allowed for the allocated device. For information about\r\nthe maximum block size and key length, see z/OS DFSMS Using Data Sets .\r\n6C An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a data set with RECFM=T in the DCB, requesting track overflow,\r\nbut the direct access device allocated does not support track overflow. Correct the DCB or specifically\r\nrequest a device that supports track overflow, through the unit parameter or through a generic name that\r\napplies only to the needed devices.\r\n70 One of the following events occurred:\r\nv An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a data set on magnetic tape. A conflict exists between LABEL\r\nparameters in the DD statement and the DCBRECFM, DCBOPTCD, DCBBUFOF, and DCBUSASI fields,\r\nwhich give the appearance of mixed ASCII and EBCDIC attributes for the data set; or TRTCH was\r\nspecified for a 9-track tape.\r\nSome examples of conflicts are that you cannot use RECFM=V, VB, or U with AL tapes, and the BLKSIZE\r\nvalue must be no more than 2048 with AL Version 1 tapes. For details about AL tape restrictions, see z/OS\r\nDFSMS Using Magnetic Tapes . Most utilities (except IEHINITT) do not support ASCII.\r\nv An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a data set not on magnetic tape. Either OPTCD=Q was\r\nspecified, or OPEN was issued for an ISAM data set using QSAM.\r\n74 An OPEN macro instruction was issued for an optical character reader data set, but option 1 in the OPEN\r\nmacro instruction did not specify input.\r\n78 An OPEN macro instruction was issued for an optical character reader data set. The BUFL parameter in the\r\nDCB was either specified as zero or incorrectly modified during processing.\r\n7C An OPEN macro instruction was issued for an optical character reader data set, but the LRECL parameter\r\nvalue in the DCB was zero. Specify an LRECL value other than zero, and rerun the job.\r\n80 An OPEN macro was issued for an optical character reader data set, but the specified BUFL value was less\r\nthan LRECL. Specify BUFL equal to, or greater than, LRECL, and rerun the job.\r\n84 An OPEN macro instruction was issued for an optical character reader data set. The number of buffers\r\nspecified in the buffer pool control block is not the same as the number of buffers specified in the\r\nDCBBUFNO field.\r\n88 An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a BSAM, BPAM or QSAM DCB for a telecommunications device,\r\nbut the DD statement or dynamic allocation did not specify TERM=TS, which would signify a TSO terminal.\r\n8C RECFM was not specified for a direct organization (BDAM) data set. Specify the correct RECFM value in the\r\nDCB.\r\n90 An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a 3890 document processor. It did not specify INPUT.\r\n94 An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a 3890 document processor. The BUFL or BLKSIZE parameter in\r\nthe DCB was less than 16 times the LRECL parameter in the DCB.\r\n98 An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a 3890 document processor. The RECFM parameter in the DCB\r\ndid not specify F or FB.\r\n9C An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a 3890 document processor. The MACRF parameter in the DCB\r\nwas not GM, or the DSORG parameter in the DCB was not PS.\r\nA0 An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a 3890 document processor. The LRECL parameter in the DCB\r\nwas not specified or was less than 12 or greater than 48.\r\nA4 A DCB was opened for a subsystem data set, such as SYSIN or SYSOUT, but DSORG was not specified as\r\nPS.\r\nA8 An incorrect record format was requested for a SYSIN, SYSOUT, or subsystem data set with BSAM or\r\nQSAM or for a z/OS UNIX directory with BPAM. One of the following conditions was detected:\r\nv RECFM=D was specified.\r\nv Variable spanned records (VS or VBS) were requested for input.\r\nv Both ANSI and machine control characters were specified.\r\nAC An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a sequential data set using the queued access technique.\r\nHowever, a key length that is not supported for using the queued access technique was specified in the\r\nDCB.\r\nB0 An OPEN macro instruction specified the RDBACK option, and the DCB specified a record format of\r\nvariable spanned records. These are conflicting parameters.\r\nB4 An OPEN macro instruction specified the INOUT, OUTIN, or OUTINX option, and the DCB specified\r\nQSAM MACRF values. These are conflicting parameters.\r\nB8 An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a 3890 document processor. The DCBHDR parameter was not\r\nspecified in the DCB.\r\nBC A subsystem DCB, such as SYSIN, SYSOUT, or a z/OS UNIX FIFO file, was opened with incorrect options.\r\nOne of these was true:\r\nv The OPEN option 1 specified UPDAT or RDBACK.\r\nv For BSAM, the NOTE and POINT macro function was selected (MACRF=RP or WP) for a FIFO file.\r\nRepositioning or updating a FIFO file is not permitted. It is also not permitted to open the file for writing\r\nwith the PATHOPTS=OAPPEND option.\r\nv For a subsystem data set, the OPEN option 1 was OUTINX.\r\nv Both the CNTRL and POINT macros were requested as if MACRF=RCP or WCP were coded. The CNTRL\r\nand POINT options are mutually exclusive.\r\nC0 An open failure occurred for a subsystem data set. Possible failures follow:\r\nv A SYSIN or SYSOUT data set opened by JES\r\nv A SYSIN or SYSOUT data set opened under the master subsystem\r\nv A z/OS UNIX file\r\nv A subsystem data set (specified with SUBSYS= on the DD statement or dynamic allocation equivalent)\r\nFor JES2, a SYSOUT data set incurred a subsystem JCL failure (SJF), and JES2 might issue a $HASP708\r\nmessage to further describe the error. For JES3, a reserved DD name, such as JOURNAL, might have been\r\nspecified in a DD statement. In either case, the failing DCB was not opened; processing for other DCBs\r\nopened in parallel continues normally.\r\nC4 During the creation of a direct data set, the open routine found that the DCB specified READ (R) or GET (G)\r\nin the MACRF field. Only WRITE LOAD (WL) is allowed.\r\nC8 One of the following events occurred:\r\nv The open subsystem module was passed an error return code in register 15 after issuing the IEFSSREQ\r\nmacro to connect the access method control block (ACB) to the subsystem. This indicates that the\r\nsubsystem was not operating, unless the recovery routine recovered from a prior program check.\r\nv IEFSSREQ failed. SMS is not available.\r\nCC An OPEN macro instruction was issued for the IBM 3800 Printing Subsystem, but the SETPRT processing to\r\nset up the device failed. For the reason for the failure, see the accompanying IEC162I message.\r\nD0 An incorrect record format of FBS or FS was specified for a partitioned data set. RECFM=FS or FBS is not\r\nsupported with BPAM.\r\nD4 A DS/DBS record format has been specified for QSAM locate mode, but the logical record interface is not\r\npresent in the associated buffer control block; that is, segment mode is implied.\r\nD8 A conflict has occurred for the extended logical record interface (XLRI) of the spanned record format.\r\nE0 The DEVTYPE macro issued during open processing had an error (register 15 was nonzero). This is probably\r\na system error.\r\nE1 A magnetic tape data set with a block size greater than 32 760 is being opened for input or output extend\r\nprocessing, but the large block interface is not being used.\r\nE4 In a partitioned concatenation, the sum of the following numbers exceeded 255: the number of partitioned\r\ndata sets extended (PDSEs), the number of UNIX directories, and the number of partitioned data set (PDS)\r\nextents. Before z/OS 1.5, the limit was approximately 120.\r\nE8 The open verification function of the IEFSSREQ macro passed an error return code in register 15. This\r\nindicates an error in connecting to the subsystem or a failure in the subsystem verification processing for the\r\ndata set.\r\nEC An OPEN macro instruction was issued with a DCB that specified an LRECL value different from that\r\nspecified by the format-1 DSCB. The data set was a PDSE. For data sets in the compressed format, this\r\nreturn code is issued only if the data set is open for output and RECFM=FB.\r\nF0 A catalog error occurred during an attempt to update the catalog record for a data set on a direct access\r\ndevice.\r\nF4 An error occurred in reading the catalog record during an attempt to open an extended-format data set.\r\nReading this record is required to determine the stripe count.\r\nF8 OPEN was issued for a DCB that specifies QSAM, RECFM=F or FB, a block size greater than 32 767, and no\r\nLRECL value. Correct the DCB parameters by specifying an LRECL value.\r\nFC OPEN was issued for a DCB that specifies that the system is to obtain and build the buffer pool. However,\r\nthe calculated size of the buffer pool is greater than the maximum size that can be requested. The calculated\r\nsize of the buffer pool is the size of the buffer control block plus the product of BUFNO (or NCP) and the\r\nbuffer length. Unless the DCB specified QSAM and RMODE31=BUFF is coded in the DCBE, the maximum\r\nbuffer storage request is 16 777 208 bytes.\r\nFD OPEN was issued for a DCB that specifies both the large block interface and OPTCD=H.\r\nFE OPEN was issued with the UPDAT option for a DCB that specifies the large block interface.\r\nFF OPEN was issued for a DCB that specifies both the large block interface and exchange buffering.\r\nSystem action: The system issues a WTP message to give the ABEND and return codes, records pertinent control\r\nblocks on the GTF data set, and abnormally ends the job.\r\nSystem programmer response: If the error recurs and the program is not in error, see the messages in the job log for\r\nmore information. Search problem reporting databases for a fix for the problem. If no fix exists, contact the IBM\r\nSupport Center and provide the SYSOUT output for the job.\r\nProgrammer response: Correct the error that caused the abnormal end, as indicated by the return code in the\r\nmessage text. Then rerun the job.\r\nIf ddnameis part of a concatenation, the error is probably because of a violation of the sequential concatenation\r\nrequirements. For more information, see z/OS DFSMS Using Data Sets .\r\nA C8 return code indicates that the subsystem was not operating when OPEN was issued. Notify your system\r\nprogrammer.\r\nIf the return code is D4, specify the logical record interface by using the BUILDRCD macro before OPEN processing\r\nor by specifying A for the DCB BFTEK operand.

The data set consists of variable\r\nformat records. The length field in the record descriptor word (RDW) is incorrect for one of the following\r\nreasons:\r\n\u2013 The RDW specifies a length less than 4.\r\n\u2013 The RDW specifies a length greater than the DCBLRECL value that was specified when the data set\r\nwas opened. DCBLRECL is the logical record length (LRECL) in the data control block (DCB).\r\nv QSAM tried to read segments of variable spanned records that are not in proper sequence.\r\nv LRECL is not large enough.\r\nv The record area in QSAM locate mode is too small to contain a logical record from a spanned-format data\r\nset.\r\nv The BDW contained a length greater than the block size specified in the data control block (DCB).\r\n08 One of the following is true:\r\nv An incorrect record was encountered on a QSAM or BSAM PUT or WRITE operation. If the large block\r\ninterface is not being used, or output is not to a magnetic tape device, then the record or block length\r\nplus the key length and required overhead add up to more than 32,767 bytes. If the large block interface is\r\nbeing used and output is to a magnetic tape device, then the block length is greater than 65,535 bytes and\r\ngreater than the block size specified when the DCB was opened.\r\nv The data consists of spanned format records, and the RDW, SDW, or BDW length field, being translated to\r\nan ISO/ANSI format, exceeds the length field capacity (9999) of the ISO/ANSI format RCW, SCW, or\r\nblock prefix.\r\n0C An incorrect record was encountered on a QSAM or BSAM PUT or WRITE operation. The record or block\r\nlength plus the key length and required overhead is greater than the DASD track capacity.\r\n10 An incorrect record was encountered on a QSAM PUT operation; the data set uses the track overflow\r\nfeature. The record descriptor word (RDW) for a variable length record specifies a length greater than\r\n32,752.\r\n14 An incorrect record was encountered on a QSAM PUT or WRITE operation. The record length is greater\r\nthan the block size specified in the DCB.\r\n18 An incorrect record was encountered on a QSAM PUT operation; the data set uses the variable record\r\nformat. The value in the length of the record descriptor word (RDW) is incorrect for one of the following\r\nreasons:\r\nv It is greater than 32,767, or greater than the block size specified in the DCB.\r\nv It is less than 4, or less than 5 if ASA or machine control characters are used.\r\nv It specifies a value greater than the DCBLRECL value (maximum record size) that was specified when the\r\ndata set was opened.\r\n1C The error occurred during the creation of a direct data set.

Return code 1C also occurs when a DCB, LRECL, BLKSIZE, RECFM, or\r\nKEYLEN parameter is missing.\r\n20 The error occurred during the creation of a direct data set. A WRITE macro instruction was issued causing a\r\nsecondary extent to be obtained. The block will not fit on the amount of space allocated for the secondary\r\nextent.\r\n24 The error occurred during the creation of a direct data set. A WRITE macro instruction was issued to write\r\nout a block larger than the primary extent on the preallocated data set. This could also occur if allocation of\r\nthe primary extent was split and any of the secondary extents were smaller than the block.\r\n28 The error occurred during the creation of a direct data set.

An image is incorrect if:\r\nv Its specified length exceeds the maximum allowed for the device.\r\nv Its specified and actual lengths are not equal.\r\nv There is an incorrect channel specified.\r\nv The last byte of the image is incorrect.\r\nIf IEA000I contains a X'04' in the first sense byte a buffer parity error occurred.\r\nSource: DFSMSdfp\r\nModule: IGG0197E\r\nRouting code: 7,10,11\r\nDescriptor code: 4", "IEC512I": " {I/O ERR | LBL ERR | SEC VOL | DUP VOL | LBL STD} dev, ser[, labtyp ][,ser][,labtyp ], jjj ,sss [, dsname] LBL [ UNI ] STD dev,ser[, reason ][,labid-postn ], jjj ,sss [, dsname], VRSN [,VMM]\r\nExplanation: An error has been detected processing the volume on the device.\r\nIf I/O ERR appears in the message text, an uncorrectable input/output error occurred while processing labels on the\r\nvolume. If this is an uninitialized tape and tapevol protection is active, this message will be issued and the volume\r\nwill be rejected because the system is not capable of identifying the tape for a protection check. In this case, a not\r\ncapable error also will be received (IOS000I NCA).\r\nIf the tape is an output tape, the tape label has probably been destroyed. The tape must be relabeled or reinitialized\r\nwith a tape mark before it can be used again.\r\nIf LBL ERR appears in the message text, the mounted volume has a different volume serial number or label attribute\r\nthan the requested volume. The mounted volume is identified by the first ser in the message and the requested\r\nvolume is identified by the second ser. If UNI appears in the message text, an uninitialized or degaussed tape\r\ncartridge is mounted. Additional messages will be issued to change the label or dismount the tape. When VRSN is\r\nspecified, an ISO/ANSI version conflict has been detected. Either the version is not a supported version, or there is a\r\nconflict between the mounted version and the requested version. The supported versions are 1, 3, and 4.\r\nIf SEC VOL appears in the message text, data set password protected tape volume ser was mounted on tape device\r\ndev. One of the following occurred:\r\nv The program was attempting to process the volume as NL or NSL; LABEL=NL or LABEL=NSL was specified on\r\nthe JCL.\r\nv The data set name on the tape did not match the data set name specified by the DSN parameter in the JCL.\r\nv The label is ISO/ANSI Version 1 or version x, but the accessibility code is not blank.\r\nv The label is ISO/ANSI Version 3 or Version 4, but the accessibility code is an incorrect character *(not uppercase A\r\nthrough Z).\r\nNote: *For Version 4, the allowable characters are: Uppercase A-Z, number 0-9, and special character s!*\"%&'()\r\n+,-/:;<=>?_\r\nv The label is ISO/ANSI Version 3 or Version 4, but the VOL1 accessibility code was rejected by the ISO/ANSI\r\nvolume access exit.\r\nv The label is ISO/ANSI Version 3 or Version 4, but the HDR1 accessibility code was rejected by the ISO/ANSI file\r\naccess exit.\r\nv The label is ISO/ANSI Version 3 or Version 4, but the HDR1 accessibility code indicated password protection.\r\nv The label is ISO/ANSI Version 3 or Version 4, but RACF or RACHECK installation exits did not authorize access.\r\nIf DUP VOL appears in the message text, end-of-volume has detected that the volser of the volume mounted to\r\nsatisfy a non specific mount request already exists in the JFCB volume list. End-of-volume will demount the volume\r\nand reissue the non specific mount request.\r\nIf DUP VOL appears in the message text, the mounted volume has previously been mounted in the same job to\r\nsatisfy a nonspecific mount request. Duplicate volume serial numbers in the JFCB volume list are not allowed.\r\nSubsequent messages indicate the disposition and ask that a volume be mounted.\r\nIf a MONITOR DSNAME command is active, dsnameindicates the data set requesting the volume.\r\nIf LBL STD appears in the message text, an error was detected during validation of a label. The error is a direct\r\nviolation of, or a conflict in system support for, the published standards for the label and its associated file structure.\r\nDFSMS Using Magnetic Tapes describes the specifications and processing of tape labels.\r\nIf VMM (Volser MisMatch) appears in the message text, a nonspecific mount request in an automated tape library\r\nresulted in a difference between the internal volume serial number of the VOL1 label, and the external volume serial\r\nnumber.\r\nIn the message text, reason is one of the following:\r\nReason Validation Error Detected\r\nD ATA An incorrect character type. For example, an alphabetic character is found in a numeric field.\r\nRANG A value out of bounds, unknown, or unsupported. For example, the specified block size is unsupported.\r\nALGN Data incorrectly aligned. For example, an alphabetic field is not left-justified.\r\nSEQU A label out of sequence.\r\nVRSN A label version that is not supported. That is, the label on a mounted tape is not compatible with the\r\nsystem's tape labeling requirements.\r\nDUPL A duplicate data set name found during data set positioning.\r\nDATE A file set contains a data set immediately before the requested data set on the same volume with an\r\nexpiration date lower than the expiration date of the data set to be written.\r\nSYMM A request that will result in an unmatching or unsymmetrical set of labels and/or inconsistent file structure.\r\nlabid is the label identifier, for example, VOL1. The identifier is followed in the message text by a slash (/) to signify\r\nthat the label was about to be written when the error was detected.\r\nThe labid field is blank when a reliable label is not available, for example, when reason is SYMM.\r\nFor DATA, RANG, or ALGN reasons, postn in the message text is the character position within the label when a\r\nvalidation error is detected. The postn value can indicate an error in an existing label or in data used to construct a\r\nnew label.\r\nFor DUPL, DATE, or SEQU reasons, postn is the file sequence number relative to the beginning of the current\r\nvolume.\r\nFor a VRSN reason, postn is the version character from VOL1 position 80.\r\npostn is ACCODE if the file accessibility code supplied by the user job step is incorrect. A value of 254+ in the\r\nmessage indicates a file sequence number greater than 254.\r\nFor a SYMM reason, postn is blank in the message text because a specific error location is not available. This can\r\noccur when a data set is opened for MOD (OLD OUTPUT/OUTIN), INOUT, OUTINX, or EXTEND.\r\nIn the message text:\r\njjj Names the job requesting the volume.\r\nsss Names the job step requesting the volume.\r\nser The volume serial number. One of the following:\r\nv A specific tape volume serial number\r\nv SCRTCH\r\nv PRIVAT\r\nSCRTCH or PRIVAT indicate non-specific volume requests. SCRTCH is used when the dataset being created\r\non the non-specific volume is temporary [DISP=(NEW,DELETE) or DSN=&&tempname]. PRIVAT is used for\r\nall other cases of non-specific volumes.\r\ndev The device number of the specified device.\r\ndsname The data set name.\r\nlabtyp The label type of the mounted volume (either SL, NL, AL, or NSL) and will appear for tape volumes only.\r\nlabid-postn\r\nThe label identification and position.\r\nreason The reason code.\r\nSystem action: If I/O ERR or SEC VOL appears in the message text, the system rewinds the volume and unloads\r\nthe unit. If the original request was for a SCRTCH or PRIVAT volume, the system requests a new volume. Otherwise,\r\nthe system ends the job step.\r\nIf LBL STD appears in the message text and VRSN does not, the installation label validation exit is entered to\r\ndetermine further processing. If both LBL STD and VRSN appear in the message text, the system does one of the\r\nfollowing:\r\nv Enters the volume label editor, if the volume is being used for output to the first data set (except extending the\r\ndata set, such as DISP=MOD).\r\nv Rejects the volume for all other output requests.\r\nv Rejects the volume for all input requests. Input volumes with label versions other than the supported versions are\r\nrejected.\r\nOperator response: If I/O ERR, LBL ERR, or SEC VOL appears in the message, respond as indicated in subsequent\r\nmessages.\r\nSystem programmer response: If the error recurs and the program is not in error, look at the messages in the job\r\nlog for more information. Search problem reporting data bases for a fix for the problem. If no fix exists, contact the\r\nIBM Support Center. Provide the JCL, the SYSOUT output, the program listing for the job, and all printed output and\r\noutput data sets related to the problem.\r\nProgrammer response: If LBL STD appears in the message, reasons DATA, RANG, or ALGN indicate an ISO/ANSI\r\nVersion 3 or Version 4 standards violation in label labid at position postn. Correct the label before rerunning the job.\r\nReason RANG with postn ACCODE indicates that the ACCODE value specified in the JCL is not a valid character.\r\nSpecify only * uppercase alphabetic characters (A-Z) for an ACCODE value. ACCODE from JCL can be one to eight\r\ncharacters, but only the first character is processed.\r\nNote: *For Version 4, the allowable characters are: Uppercase A-Z, number 0-9, and special character s!*\"%&'()+\r\n,-/:;<=>?_\r\nIf LBL STD appears in the message text, reasons SEQU, DUPL, or DATE indicate an error during positioning of the\r\ntape to the requested data set. The error was detected at the file number indicated in postn, relative to the beginning\r\nof the volume. A postn value of 254+ means that the problem occurred at a data set beyond the 254th data set on the\r\nvolume. The labid with a DATE reason is the label identifier of the previous data set's trailing label, which was used\r\nto compare the expiration date sequence. Correct the source of the violation before rerunning the job.\r\nIf LBL STD appears in the message text, reason SYMM indicates that specifications for the data set will produce\r\nunsymmetrical ISO/ANSI labels framing the data set, or that the ISO/ANSI label will not match its counterpart at\r\nthe end of the data set. Some mismatches are allowed by the ISO/ANSI standard, such as block length and reserved\r\nfor system use. In the message, labid and postn are blank. A SYMM violation results from:\r\nv DISP=(MOD,...) for an existing output data set, including OUTIN.\r\nv Open for EXTEND, OUTINX, or INOUT.\r\nv Using an EXCP DCB without at least a four-word device-dependent area, to maintain a tape block count.\r\nCorrect the violation, and rerun the job.\r\nIf LBL STD appears in the message text, reason VRSN indicates that the system cannot process the mounted volume,\r\nwhich contains an ISO/ANSI label with a version other than 3 or 4 indicated. The version code contained in the\r\nVOL1 label on the mounted volume is displayed as postn in the message. An ISO/ANSI labeled volume cannot be\r\nprocessed when:\r\nv The volume is being processed for input and the version number is not 1, 3, or 4.\r\nv The volume is being processed for output to other than the first data set and the version is not 3 or4.\r\nCorrect the violation and rerun the job. A version 3 or version 4 ISO/ANSI label can be created by using the\r\nIEHINITT utility program.\r\nStart a generalized trace facility (GTF) trace, and re-create the problem.

If the REGION= size is large enough so that IEBCOPY is being given the full amount that it requests for its work\r\narea, then increase the REGION= parameter and the WORK= parameter by the same amount. This condition is\r\ntrue when maximumequals obtained.\r\n2.

Reduce the amount specified for buffers (with the SIZE= invocation parameter) to the minimum amount (or\r\ndefault it). This will use the minimum amount of work area virtual storage as buffers and increase the amount of\r\nvirtual storage available for member names and directory entries. Doing this most often results in decreased\r\nperformance, even if it increases the size of the WORK= area so that the spill file is no longer used.\r\n2.

When asynchronous orders complete the library uses attention I/O to signal the host. At that time the\r\norder will be removed from the queue.\r\nFor a request to display the library partitioning category codes, below is an example showing the system default\r\ncategory code:\r\nDS QL,CATS\r\n IEE459I 09.56.42 DEVSERV QLIB 600\r\n0001 0002 0003 0004 0005 0006 0007 0008 0009 000A 000E 000F\r\nFor a request to change the library partitioning category codes, the first 3 digits of the category can be modified with\r\nthe last digit being fixed and representing the media type:\r\nDS QL,CATS(111*)\r\n IEE459I 09.57.01 DEVSERV QLIB 603\r\n1111 1112 1113 1114 1115 1116 1117 1118 1119 111A 111E 111F\r\nNote: If the library partitioning category codes are modified using the DQ QL,CATS command, the corresponding\r\nchanges must also be reflected in the DEVSUPxx PARMLIB member. If not, an IPL reverts the category codes to what\r\nis specified in DEVSUPxx.\r\nAfter the category codes have been updated, issue the DS QL,CATS command to reflect the updated categories:\r\nDS QL,CATS\r\n IEE459I 09.57.11 DEVSERV QLIB 606\r\n1111 1112 1113 1114 1115 1116 1117 1118 1119 111A 111E 111F\r\nNote: APAR OA24965 of Device Service is needed before you use the DEVSERV QLIB,CATS command. This APAR is\r\nneeded to additionally recognize and support media types MEDIA9 and MEDIA10.\r\nWhen a list of library devices that failed initialization during IPL is requested, the display lists up to 8 library devices\r\nper line as follows:\r\nDS QL,IEA438I\r\n IEE459I 11.58.04 DEVSERV QLIB 620\r\nDevice initialization errors detected during IPL\r\n9AFA-09 9A1A-09 9ABA-09 9ADA-09 9A9A-09 9A5A-09 9A3A-09 9A7A-09\r\n9A1B-09 9A3B-09 9A5B-09 9A7B-09 9A9B-09 9ABB-09 9ADB-09 9AFB-09\r\n9A1C-09 9A3C-09 9A5C-09 9A7C-09 9A9C-09 9ABC-09 9ADC-09 9AFC-09\r\n9A1D-09 9A3D-09 9A7D-09 9A5D-09 9A9D-09 9ADD-09 9ABD-09 9AFD-09\r\nThe number following the dash identifies the error that was detected during IPL.

During IPL, I/O is terminated if it does not complete in 15 seconds. If the\r\nlibrary is busy it might have taken too long to respond to the initialization I/O. If the device is defined to be varied\r\nonline during IPL, that vary will fail.

For an output data set, all space was used on the current volume and no more volumes were specified.\r\n2. The system had to demount a volume in order to mount the next volume of the data set. It was unable\r\nto demount the volume for one of the following reasons:\r\na. The volume was permanently resident\r\nb. The volume was reserved\r\nc. Another job had data sets allocated on the volume\r\nd. There were open data sets on the volume for the failing task.\r\nFor an output data set on a direct access device, the system might have needed to demount the volume for\r\none of the following reasons:\r\nv No more space was available on the volume.\r\nv The data set already had the maximum number of extents, but required more space. The maximum\r\nnumber of extents on each volume for basic format, large format and partitioned (PDS) data sets is 16.\r\nThe maximum number of extents on each volume for extended format or a PDSE is 123.\r\nv The data set has reached the maximum number of tracks per volume. For basic format and partitioned\r\n(PDS) data sets, the limit is 65,535 tracks. For large format data sets, the limit is 16,777,215 tracks. For\r\nextended format and PDSE, the limit is larger than any currently supported volume. The theoretical limit\r\nfor a PDSE is 178,956,970 tracks. The theoretical limit for an extended format data set that is not\r\ncompressed format is 2,147,483,646 blocks per volume. The theoretical limit for a compressed format data\r\nset is 1,073,741,823 tracks per volume. These limits are subject to change.\r\nv More space was required, but the volume table of contents (VTOC) was full. If additional space were\r\nallocated, another data set control block (DSCB) might have been needed, but could not have been\r\nwritten.\r\nFor an output data set on magnetic tape, a volume needed to be demounted because the reflective spot was\r\nencountered and more records were to be written.\r\nFor an input data set on more than one volume, one of the volumes needed to be demounted so that the\r\nnext one could be mounted, but the system was unable to demount the volume.\r\n08 During end-of-volume processing, the system attempted to extend data set dsnameto a volume on which the\r\nVSE bit or the DIRF bit (bits 0 and 5 respectively in the DS4VTOCI byte of the format-4 DSCB) was set. The\r\nVTOC for the volume could not be converted to standard format for one of the following reasons:\r\nv Two data sets were allocated to the same space on the volume.\r\nv A split cylinder data set was located on cylinder zero, the same cylinder as the VTOC, or the same\r\ncylinder as a non-split cylinder data set.\r\nv The DADSM VTOC conversion routine had been modified to reject any space allocation requests on a\r\nvolume on which the DIRF bit is set to one. See z/OS DFSMSdfp Diagnosis for more information.\r\nv Under VSE, the alternate tracks were assigned to cylinder zero.\r\n0C The indicated direct access volume ser on device dev was requested to continue processing the data set, but\r\nthe unit already contained 127 users, the maximum number.\r\nSystem action: The task is ended unless the error is to be ignored as specified in the DCB ABEND exit routine.

All records\r\npresented to SMF will be lost until buffers become available.\r\nThis message may be issued for the following conditions:\r\n1.

IEC501A is issued by EOV when the end of a volume has been reached and the next volume to be processed is\r\nneeded immediately.

Make sure that the correct\r\nvolume is mounted. If it is the correct volume, it must be recreated on an IBM system.\r\nFor ISO/ANSI Version 3 or Version 4: This message occurs after message IEC502E with theddn-c field in the\r\nmessage text and with c=2, meaning that access to the requested data set has been denied.\r\n0C An OPEN macro instruction was issued, but either an I/O error occurred during password verification, or\r\none of the following conditions occurred:\r\n1. For a password-protected data set, the operator failed to supply the correct password in response to\r\nmessage IEC301A or Time Sharing Option/Extensions (TSO/E) message IEC113A.\r\n2. For a protected VSAM data space that has password-protected or RACF-protected data or index\r\ncomponents, the operator failed to supply the correct passwords or the user did not have proper RACF\r\nauthorization.\r\n3. For a VSAM data set being opened using a DCB, the DSCB contained incorrect information.\r\n10 An OPEN macro was issued to the VTOC for output processing by an unauthorized job step or job-step\r\ntask. The ability to open the VTOC for output is restricted to authorized job steps or job step tasks.\r\n14 An OPEN macro instruction was issued to concatenate checkpoint and noncheckpoint data sets.\r\n18 An OPEN TYPE=J macro instruction was issued for a magnetic tape volume. The JFCB was modified to\r\nindicate LABEL=BLP (bypass label processing) and the task was not authorized. BLP can be specified in the\r\nJCL (if the installation allows it via its reader procedure), but the JFCB cannot be modified to indicate BLP\r\nunless the task is authorized.\r\n1C The error occurred during processing of an OPEN TYPE=J macro instruction to a data set residing on a\r\ndirect access device. The JFCB has been incorrectly modified or the data set name supplied in the JFCB\r\npassed to OPEN was not available to the job because it was being used by some other job. Either (1) the\r\ndata set was being opened for INPUT and some other job had exclusive control of the data set (either\r\nreferenced the data set in a DD control statement with DISP of OLD or MOD, or issued an OPEN TYPE=J\r\nmacro instruction with processing option INOUT, OUTIN, OUTPUT, OUTINX, EXTEND, or UPDATE), or (2)\r\nthe data set was being opened for an option other than INPUT (INOUT, OUTIN, OUTPUT, or UPDATE:\r\nrequiring exclusive control of the data set) and some other JOB was using the data set (either referenced the\r\ndata set in a DD control statement, or issued an OPEN TYPE=J macro instruction).\r\n20 An OPEN macro instruction was issued using the EXCP access method in which user-written appendages\r\nwere required. The appendage names were not included in the SYS1.PARMLIB member IEAAPP00, and the\r\nprogram issuing the OPEN was not authorized either under APF, or by being in a system protect key (0-7).\r\n28 An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a checkpoint data set. The data set organization was not BPAM\r\nor BSAM and the task was not authorized via the authorized program facility (APF).\r\n2C An OPEN or OPEN TYPE=J macro instruction was issued to an ISAM data set defined by two or three DD\r\nstatements. Either 1) the data set names coded in the DD statements were not all the same, or 2) the JFCB\r\npassed to OPEN TYPE=J has a data set name different from that coded in the DD statements. All the DD\r\nstatements for an ISAM data set must contain the same data set name. If an OPEN TYPE=J macro\r\ninstruction is issued to a DDname referencing an ISAM data set which is defined by two or three DD\r\nstatements, the data set name cannot be altered from that coded in the DD statement, because the JFCBs for\r\nthe other DD statements cannot be similarly altered.\r\n30 An OPEN macro instruction was issued to write a data set on a magnetic tape containing one or more\r\nprevious data sets. The protection mode of the data set to be written was different than the protection mode\r\nof the previous data set.\r\n34 The OPEN/EOV volume security exit requested that the volume be rejected.\r\n38 An OPEN was issued for a RACF-protected data set on a DASD volume or a RACF-protected tape volume\r\nto which the caller was not authorized.\r\n3C An OPEN was issued for a non VSAM data set with a format-1 DSCB indicating a discrete RACF-protection,\r\nbit DS1IND40 set. RACROUTE REQUEST=AUTH was issued resulting in SAF, Security Authorization\r\nFacility, return code 4. This indicates the SAF router could neither accept nor fail the request. Verify the\r\nRACF security function is running on the system and that a discrete profile for the data set exists in the\r\nRACF database. Seez/OS Security Server RACROUTE Macro Reference for complete explanation for SAF\r\nreturn code 4.\r\n40 A VSAM data space being OPENed is RACF-defined.\r\n44 An OPEN macro was issued to a password-protected data set. However the system's PASSWORD data set\r\nwas not valid because it is in large or extended format.\r\n48 Incorrect specification of PROTECT. PROTECT is specified but the system tape option is not in effect.\r\n4C Incorrect specification of PROTECT.

The issuer of such an OPEN TYPE=J must ensure that no\r\nother JOB is processing the data set in a manner which is in conflict with the processing requested by the OPEN\r\nmacro instruction. This can best be accomplished by not using the OPEN TYPE=J macro instruction to open to a data\r\nset which is not already referenced in a DD control statement, and not opening with a processing option of INOUT,\r\nOUTIN, OUTPUT, OUTINX, EXTEND, or UPDATE unless the DD control statement indicates DISP=OLD or\r\nDISP=MOD.

Consequently, the library sets\r\npolicy names for the mounted volume to the default policy name. Even though the default policy names might be\r\nassociated with the volume, the default policy actions might not always be used. There are times when the library\r\nwill bind policy actions (for example, logical WORM, volume size, copy modes, and so on.) to the volume early in\r\nthe mount process. In this case, the policy actions used by the library might be a mixture of both the requested and\r\nthe default actions.\r\nEither the library incurred an internal processing error and could not assign the specified policy names to the\r\nvolume, or a policy name was to be created (not already defined for the library) when the maximum number of 255\r\nunique construct names per construct type had already been reached.\r\nThis message can also be issued (except file sequence 1, DISP=NEW), if one or more of the construct definitions\r\nassociated with an existing volume have been removed from the library. Default policy actions will be used for the\r\nconstruct definitions that are not found, and the library will maintain the volume\u2019s construct assignments. The\r\ndefault policy name will not be substituted for an unfound construct definition.

It is only issued to the System Log.\r\nThe volume on the device is to have the indicated disposition. The disposition (n) is one of the following:\r\nK- Implies PRIVATE volume; the volume is to be demounted and returned to the library.\r\nD- Implies PUBLIC volume; the volume is to be demounted and used as a scratch volume when the job ends.\r\nRK- Implies PRIVATE-RETAIN volume; the volume is to be demounted and retained near the system for future\r\nuse. In the event that the job ends and the volume has not been remounted, return it to the library.\r\nRD- Implies PUBLIC-RETAIN volume; the volume is to be demounted and retained near the system for future\r\nuse.

In\r\nthe event that the job ends and the volume has not been remounted, the operator must determine what\r\ndisposition to give to the volume. This message will appear if a volume is rejected because it is not the\r\nvolume requested (for example, a conflict in the label, label type, or density).\r\nIf the serial number is blank, O/C/EOV look ahead mount has found a premounted and unverified\r\n(UCBVOLI=ZEROS) volume on the next available unit. Operator intervention is required to verify that the proper\r\nvolume is mounted.\r\nIf the serial number is a 6-digit serial number, the volume with that serial number is to be demounted from the\r\ndevice.\r\nIf the serial number begins with L, the volume to be demounted is unlabeled; the number after the first character is\r\nan internal serial number assigned by the system to an unlabeled volume. The internal serial number is of the form\r\nLaaabb where aaa is the data set number (0-999) and bb is the volume sequence number (0-99). The numbers are\r\nrecycled after they reach the limit.\r\nIn the message text, labtyp indicates the label type of the demounted volume (either SL, AL, NL, or NSL) and will\r\nappear for tape volumes only).\r\nThe reason for demounting is as follows:\r\nc Reason for Demounting\r\n1\r\nFor ISO/ANSI Version 1: The accessibility field of the volume label contains a nonblank character, which\r\nmeans the volume is data set password protected and may not be processed by the operating system.\r\nFor ISO/ANSI Version 3 or Version 4: The accessibility code in the volume label is not acceptable for further\r\nprocessing because of one of the following:\r\n1. It is not a blank.\r\n2. It is not an *uppercase A through Z.\r\n3. It was rejected by the volume access exit *(for A through Z).\r\nNote: *For Version 4, the allowable characters are: Uppercase A-Z, number 0-9, and special character s!*\"%\r\n&'()+,-./:;<=>?_\r\n2\r\nFor ISO/ANSI Version 1:The accessibility field of the volume label contains a nonblank character other than\r\nthe character 1, which means the file may not be processed by the operating system.\r\nFor ISO/ANSI Version 3 or Version 4: The accessibility code in the first data set label (for example, HDR1)\r\nis:\r\nv A character that is not acceptable for further processing because:\r\n\u2013 It is not a blank, not an *uppercase A through Z, or not an MVS-recognized numeric, that is ,a1or3\r\nwith system code IBMZLA.\r\n\u2013 It was rejected by the file access exit *(for A through Z).\r\n\u2013 It was accepted, but the ACCODE value *(A through Z) was rejected by the file access exit.\r\n\u2013 Blank, but the ACCODE value for an output data set was rejected by the file access exit.\r\nNote: *For Version 4, the allowable characters are: Uppercase A-Z, number 0-9, and special character s!*\"%\r\n&'()+,-./:;<=>?_\r\n3 The system cannot process the volume which is recorded in ASCII. The system has been modified when the\r\nCVTASCII bit was set to zero.\r\n4 The control program has determined that conflicting data control block (DCB) attributes have been used to\r\ndefine the data set on the volume. Some of the conflicting attributes are:\r\nv BUFOFF greater than 99.\r\nv BUFOFF equal to L on OUTPUT or OUTIN.\r\nv BUFOFF equal to L and RECFM not equal to D.\r\nv OPTCD not equal to Q and LABEL equal to AL or LABEL equal to AUL.\r\nv OPTCD not equal to Q and RECFM equal to D.\r\nv OPTCD equal to Q and DSORG not equal to PS.\r\nv OPTCD equal to Q and RECFM equal to V.\r\nv LABEL equal to AL or AUL specified for a 7-track tape device.\r\n5 This message follows IEC512I when the system detects violation of a label standard and the installation label\r\nvalidation exit issues a return code indicating the volume should be rejected. An abnormal end follows.\r\n6 The volume contains an ISO/ANSI volume label that is not supported. To be processed as an ISO/ANSI\r\nvolume, the volume label must contain a 1, 3, or 4 to specify Version 1, Version 3, or Version 4 in character\r\nposition 80. An output request to a data set other than the first data set of an ISO/ANSI Version 1 tape is\r\nnot supported.\r\n7 The volume was rejected by the operator in response to a WTOR.\r\n8 A volume label conflict was detected during manual-mode processing in an IBM 3495 Tape Library\r\nDataserver. A subsequent mount will be issued to allow verification of the tape volume.\r\n9 The volume serial number of the mounted or operator supplied volume serial to be used in labeling a\r\nscratch volume in an MTLDS is not defined in the tape configuration database. The volume is dismounted\r\nand a mount message reissued.\r\n10 The volume serial number of the mounted or operator supplied volume serial to be used in labeling a\r\nscratch volume in an MTLDS is defined in the tape configuration database but does not reside in this\r\nMTLDS. The volume is rejected and another mount request is issued.\r\n11 The volume serial number of the mounted or operator supplied volume serial to be used in labeling a\r\nscratch volume in an MTLDS is defined as a private volume in the tape configuration database.\r\n12 NL specific volume serial was requested for input, but the volume is a labeled volume (either ISO/ANSI or\r\nIBM) and the ATL is in manual mode. Verify that the correct volume is mounted.\r\n13 The volume serial number of the mounted volume is already enqueued. Verify that the volume mounted\r\nmatches the volume requested.\r\n14 The mounted 3590 cartridge is either an unsupported media type or medium length.\r\nIf the tape mounted was for a non-specific mount request, SCRATCH, demount the cartridge and select\r\nanother. Verify that the correct volume is mounted for a specific mount request, private. If it was the correct\r\nvolume the mount request may have to cancelled.\r\n15 The mounted 3590 cartridge is unformatted and it must be formatted prior to its use.

All volumes of a multivolume data set are to be assigned the same policy\r\nnames; however, due to an internal processing error at the library, the policy names assigned to the previous volume\r\ncould not be assigned to the next volume of the multivolume data set. Consequently, the library sets policy names for\r\nthe mounted volume to the default policy name.\r\nEven though the default policy names might be associated with the volume, the default policy actions might not\r\nalways be used. There are times when the library will bind policy actions (for example, logical WORM, volume size,\r\ncopy modes, and so on) to the volume early in the mount process.

The VTOC conversion\r\nfunction either converts a VTOC from indexed (IXVTOC) format to unindexed (OSVTOC) format or repairs a VTOC\r\nin unindexed format that contains incomplete information, or has been damaged.\r\nThe VTOC conversion function might be entered during any DASD space allocation request for a new data set, or\r\nduring any request for additional DASD space for an existing data set. The value of cde (the code) indicates the\r\nreason why VTOC conversion was entered. If the code is DOS, this indicates that VTOC conversion was entered\r\nbecause either a previous allocation was made on the volume using the VSE operating system, or the VTOC was\r\nindexed but the Index was disabled. In the former case, the VSE operating system does not maintain all the VTOC\r\ninformation required by MVS; VTOC conversion will repair the VTOC by establishing the incomplete information. In\r\nthe latter case, one of the following messages might have preceded this message: IEC606I, IEC608I, IEC609I. If the\r\ncode is DIRF, this indicates that VTOC conversion was entered because the last request against this volume was\r\nprematurely interrupted, leaving the VTOC in a partially updated state.\r\nThe VTOC conversion function will repair any inconsistencies within the partially updated VTOC. Message IEC999I\r\nmight have preceded this message. If the code is anything other than DOS or DIRF, this indicates that the VTOC\r\nmight have been damaged. VTOC conversion will repair any inconsistencies within the VTOC. In this case, the code\r\nvalue indicates the state of fields within the format 4 DSCB.This information might be of value in determining the\r\ncause of the damage to the VTOC. If the code contains the character D, this indicates field DS4DVTOC is on,\r\notherwise field DS4DVTOC is off. If code contains the character I, this indicates field DS4IVTOC is on, otherwise\r\nfield DS4IVTOC is off. If the code contains the character G, this indicates field DS4EFVLD is on, otherwise field\r\nDS4EFVLD is off. If the code contains the character C, this indicates field DS4DOSBT is on, otherwise field\r\nDS4DOSBT is off.

For this case, make sure that the\r\nDSNAME and VOLUME parameters in the DD statement or in the catalog are correct.\r\nv The data set name in the JFCB passed to OPEN has been incorrectly modified.\r\nv The volume serial number of the data set name supplied in the JFCB passed to OPEN was not available\r\nto the job because it was being used by some other job. (It's possible that the volume serial number in the\r\nJFCB of either this job or the other job which is already using the volume, has been incorrectly modified.)\r\nEither the data set was being opened for INPUT and some other job had exclusive control of the data set\r\n(either referenced the data set in a DD control statement with DISP of OLD or MOD, or issued an OPEN\r\nTYPE=J macro instruction with processing option INOUT, OUTIN, OUTPUT, OUTINX, EXTEND, or\r\nUPDATE), or the data set was being opened for an option other than INPUT (INOUT, OUTIN, OUTPUT,\r\nor UPDATE: requiring exclusive control of the data set) and some other job was using the data set (either\r\nreferenced the data set in a DD control statement, or issued an OPEN TYPE=J macro instruction).\r\n08 An OPEN macro instruction was issued for a password-protected data set, but the system was unable to\r\nlocate the PASSWORD data set.

The data set is a PDSE or extended-format data set.\r\n88 An OPEN macro instruction was attempted for a path, using a DCB, but the system does not support the\r\ncombination of access method and OPEN macro option. With BSAM and QSAM, OPEN supports any\r\noptions except RDBACK and UPDAT. With BPAM, the system supports only the INPUT option of OPEN.\r\n8C An OPEN macro instruction was attempted for an HFS data set, using a DCB. You cannot use BSAM or\r\nQSAM OPEN to open a data set with DSNTYPE=HFS.\r\n90 An OPEN was attempted for a PDSE data set while a restore operation was in progress.\r\n94 An OPEN macro instruction was attempted against an extended-format data set, but the DSORG value is\r\nnot PS.\r\n98 An OPEN was issued for an extended-format data set that consists of more than one stripe, but the volumes\r\nspecified were not in the correct ascending sequence.\r\n9C An OPEN macro instruction was issued with a DCB that pointed to a data control block extension (DCBE)\r\nthat had a nonzero DCB pointer. The DCB address in the DCBE must be zero before OPEN is issued.\r\nA0 OPEN detected a bad return code from TRKCALC while processing an extended-format data set.\r\nA4 OPEN detected a bad return code from a system service used in calculating the high-allocated relative byte\r\nnumber (RBN) of an extended-format data set.\r\nA8 OPEN detected that the stripes of an extended-format data set were not consistent.\r\nAC OPEN detected that the last volume indicator in the volume label of one of the stripes of an\r\nextended-format data set was set incorrectly.\r\nB0 OPEN detected that the last volume indicator was not set in the last stripe of an extended-format data set.\r\nB4 OPEN detected that the volume sequence number in the volume label of one of the stripes of an\r\nextended-format data set was incorrect.\r\nB8 An OPEN was attempted against an extended-format data set with a DCB that specified EXCP. EXCP is not\r\nsupported for extended-format data sets.\r\nBC An OPEN macro instruction was issued; however, the DCB specified BDAM and OPTCD=A, which is\r\ninvalid.\r\nC0 An OPEN macro instruction was attempted against an extended-format data set; however, one or more of\r\nthe stripes did not satisfy the hardware requirements of an extended-format data set.\r\nC4 An OPEN was issued for an extended-format data set, which is not supported on this level of the system.\r\nC8 An attempt was made to open a compressed data set for update.
