DFSMShsm found that a\r\ndump copy was the most recent copy for the criteria. DFSMShsm invoked DFSMSdss to restore the data set. This was\r\nsuccessful. The catalog may not reflect the correct information about the data set. The reascode gives an indication of\r\nthe conditions and the necessary action to take to correct the situation.\r\nReascode\r\nMeaning\r\n4 The command was issued for a VSAM data set that was no longer cataloged when the command was\r\nissued. If a backup version exists for the data set, DFSMShsm IMPORTS it to reconstruct the catalog records\r\nproperly. If either the IMPORT fails or a backup version does not exist, DFSMShsm invokes DFSMSdss to do\r\na restore of the data set. This is successful, but the data set may not be cataloged.\r\n8 The TOVOLUME parameter was used on the RECOVER or HRECOVER command and the specified volume\r\nwas different than the volume where the VSAM non-SMS-managed data set currently exists. If a backup\r\nversion exists for the data set, DFSMShsm IMPORTS it to reconstruct the catalog records properly. Either the\r\nIMPORT fails or a backup version does not exist. DFSMShsm then invokes DFSMSdss to do a restore of the\r\ndata set. This is successful. The data set and the catalog entries are restored to the target volume. The\r\ncatalog records still refer to the original volume, rather than the target volume of the restore.\r\n12 A DFSMShsm authorized user explicitly requested that a dump copy be used to restore a multivolume\r\nVSAM data set not currently cataloged or is currently cataloged as non-SMS and on a volume(s) other than\r\nthe TOVOLUME specified. DFSMShsm does not IMPORT the backup version to reconstruct the catalog\r\nrecords even if a backup version exists, since the volume sequence number may not be the same as the\r\noriginal number when the dump was taken. This could cause restore to fail.\r\nSystem action: DFSMShsm processing continues.\r\nProgrammer response: Use the IDCAMS DIAGNOSE command for the data set name and include the entry to\r\ndetermine what information the catalog and catalog entry contain for the data set.

(If sg is \"**\",\r\nthe message applies to all storage groups specified on a BACKVOL command.)

For DUPLICATE CLASS, a dump class was specified more than once. For RESET SPECIFIED, the reset option is\r\nrequested for dump class class . RESET is an invalid option for dump classes assigned to copy pool volumes because\r\nthe change indicator cannot be reset. For FREQUENCY NOT MET, the frequency or day setting specified in the\r\nrequired dump class is not met. For BACKUP NOT COMPLETE, a complete backup copy does not exist for\r\ngeneration 0 of copy pool cpname, so the dump cannot be performed to dump class class .\r\nSystem action: The dump continues as long as the volume or storage group is assigned at least one other dump\r\nclass that is an eligible target for this dump and has a tape unit successfully allocated for it. DFSMShsm processing\r\ncontinues.\r\nFor copy pool dump, if FREQUENCY NOT MET or BACKUP NOT COMPLETE, auto dump of copy pool cpname\r\nwill continue for eligible dump classes. Otherwise, the operation ends for copy pool dump if a required dump class\r\nis not an eligible target for this dump.

Make sure this dump\r\nclass does not appear in any storage group definitions if the volume is SMS managed; this may require a change to\r\nthe storage group definition to be made using ISMF.\r\nFor TAPE ALLOCATION FAILURE, see the preceding ARC0500I message that gives the failure reason and problem\r\ndetermination. If message ARC0635I follows this message with return code 8, then the dump operation ended\r\nbecause no other dump copies were processed successfully or this was the only dump copy to be created. If a dump\r\nto this dump class is required for the volume or storage group, reissue a BACKVOL command after defining or\r\nenabling the dump class, as needed.\r\nFor copy pool dump, remove the dump class from either the copy pool definition or the FRBACKUP command or\r\nboth, or replace it with another dump class not defined with RESET or, if you specify RESET, change the dump class\r\ndefinition so that RESET is not specified.

Either automatic backup was in\r\nprogress or a BACKVOL command with the PRIMARY parameter was being processed. During the backup\r\noperation, one of the following occurred:\r\nv A STOP command was issued to shut down DFSMShsm.\r\nv A SETSYS command with the EMERGENCY parameter was issued to put DFSMShsm in emergency mode.\r\nv A HOLD command with a BACKUP or BACKUP(AUTO) parameter was issued to suspend backup or auto backup\r\nprocessing.\r\nv The automatic backup quiesce time is reached.\r\nv A SETSYS command with the NOBACKUP parameter was issued to disable the backup function.\r\nSystem action: If the HOLD command with the BACKUP parameter was issued, DFSMShsm will complete any\r\nvolume backup operations that were in progress and no new volume backup operations are started.\r\nIf the SETSYS command with the NOBACKUP parameter was issued, any volume backup operations that were in\r\nprogress do not complete and no new volume backup operations are started.\r\nWhen the automatic backup quiesce time is reached, DFSMShsm will complete any volume backup operations that\r\nwere in progress. No new volume backup operations are started.\r\nIf the STOP command or SETSYS command with the EMERGENCY parameter was issued, all volume backup\r\noperations end at the completion of the current data set, and no new volume backup operations are started.\r\nDFSMShsm processing continues.\r\nOperator response: If automatic backup was in progress, it can be resumed at the point of interruption by issuing\r\none of the following corresponding system programmer or operator commands:\r\nv START DFSMShsm (DFSMShsm is the DFSMShsm cataloged procedure)\r\nv SETSYS NOEMERGENCY\r\nv RELEASE BACKUP or RELEASE BACKUP(AUTO)\r\nv SETSYS BACKUP\r\nFor automatic backup to be resumed at the point of interruption, the command must take effect the same day as the\r\ncommand that caused automatic backup to end, and the current time must still be within the start window for\r\nautomatic backup.\r\nFor automatic backup to begin after midnight, the value of the latest start time can be smaller than the planned start\r\ntime. For example, specify 2330 for hhmm1and 0100 for hhmm2on the same day as the command that caused\r\nautomatic backup to end. The current time must still be within the start window for automatic backup.\r\nWhen automatic backup ends because the quiesce time is reached, it cannot be resumed because the current time is\r\nno longer within the start window.\r\nIf a BACKVOL command with the PRIMARY parameter was in progress, it can be resumed at the point of\r\ninterruption only if the HOLD command with the BACKUP parameter or SETSYS command with the NOBACKUP\r\nparameter caused it to end. The BACKVOL command with the PRIMARY parameter can be resumed by issuing the\r\ncorresponding RELEASE command with the BACKUP parameter or the SETSYS command with the BACKUP\r\nparameter, provided the command is issued during the same startup of DFSMShsm as the command that caused the\r\nmultiple-volume backup command to end.\r\nProgrammer response: None.\r\nSource: DFSMShsm", "ARC1378I": " UNCATALOGUED DATA SET COULD NOT BE PROCESSED FOR BACKUP\r\nExplanation: A request sent to DFSMShsm to back up an uncatalogued data set failed because DFSMSdss was the\r\ndata mover or because the data set is backed up with the RETAINDAYS keyword specified..

This is dependent upon which command has\r\nbeen processing. In this case the command that has been processing will not be purged from DFSMShsm\u2019s work\r\nqueue.

If the task is still active in the system, issue an MVS FORCE command to cancel the address space.\r\nProgrammer response: In the case of a timing failure, verify that the procedure name used by DFSMShsm to start a\r\nsecondary address space exists. In this case, the aggregate backup or aggregate recovery command remains on the\r\nqueue. When the problem is corrected, release the function that has been held.

See z/OS DFSMShsm Implementation and\r\nCustomization Guide , under \u201cAuthorizing and Protecting DFSMShsm Resources\u201d for a description of how to add tape\r\nvolumes to DFSMShsm\u2019s RACF tape volume sets. Before RACF-protecting the tape volume, DFSMShsm issues two\r\nRACHECK macros to determine the current protection status of the tape volume.\r\nThe first RACHECK macros issued by DFSMShsm indicates that the tape volume is RACF-protected. The second\r\nRACHECK macro issued by DFSMShsm indicates that the tape volume does not appear in a DFSMShsm RACF tape\r\nvolume set of either HSMHSM or DFHSMx.\r\nBecause the tape volume is RACF-protected but does not appear in a DFSMShsm RACF tape volume set, DFSMShsm\r\nwill not use it. The tape volume is indicated as full in all necessary records in the DFSMShsm control data sets to\r\nprevent DFSMShsm from using it again. DFSMShsm control data set records indicate that the tape volume already\r\ncontains valid DFSMShsm data.\r\nProgrammer response: The system programmer or storage administrator responsible for DFSMShsm operations\r\nshould contact the RACF security administrator for assistance in resolving this problem. The RACF security\r\nadministrator can determine who has protected the tape volume (owner) and who has access to the tape volume by\r\nentering the following RACF command:\r\nRLIST TAPEVOL volserALL\r\nThe sender of the command must have a certain level of access authority to the resource depending on the\r\ninformation being requested.\r\nFor additional information, see z/OS Security Server RACF Command Language Reference .\r\nIf the volume is defined to DFSMShsm as a backup volume or a tape migration volume, the system programmer or\r\nstorage administrator responsible for DFSMShsm operations can determine which valid data is on the tape volume\r\nby entering the following DFSMShsm space manager command: LIST TTOC( volser) TERMINAL\r\nIf the volume is defined to DFSMShsm as a dump volume, the following command will appear if the volume\r\ncontains a valid dump copy: LIST DUMPVOLUME ( volser)\r\nIf a DUMP VTOC data set is associated with the dump copy of the tape volume, the following command will display\r\nthe contents of the tape volume at the time of the dump: LIST DUMPVOLUME ( volser) BACKUPCONTENTS\r\nThe system programmer should print the data on the tape volume to determine what data actually exists on the\r\nvolume. The data printed should be visually inspected to determine if the volume contains DFSMShsm backup\r\nversions or migration copies. DFSMShsm backup versions or migration copies are written in 16K records. The\r\nbeginning of the first 16K record of a backup version or migration copy contains a control black known as the\r\ncommon data set descriptor record (CDD). For additional information, see z/OS DFSMShsm Diagnosis .\r\nThe header labels (HDR1 and HDR2) and trailer labels (EOF1 and EOF2) of the data sets on the tape volume can also\r\nbe useful in determining if data sets are DFSMShsm backup version or migration copies.\r\nIf the tape volume physically contains DFSMShsm backup versions or migration copies, the RACF security\r\nadministrator should inform the owner of the tape volume that the tape volume contains DFSMShsm backup\r\nversions or migration copies. If the volume does not contain necessary data and can be used by DFSMShsm, the\r\nowner should remove the RACF protection.\r\nRACF protection can be removed from the tape volume by one of the following methods:\r\nv If the tape volume is RACF-protected as a single volume, the profile in the RACF data set can be deleted by\r\nentering the following RACF command: RDELETE TAPEVOL ( volser)\r\nv If the tape volume is RACF-protected as part of a tape volume set, the tape volume can be removed from the tape\r\nvolume set by entering the following RACF command: RALTER TAPEVOL ( resource-name ) DELVOL (volser)\r\nTo delete the profile from the RACF data set or delete the volume from a tape volume set, the user entering the\r\nRDELETE or RALTER command must have a certain attribute or certain level of access authority to the resource\r\nbeing deleted. For additional information, see z/OS Security Server RACF Command Language Reference .\r\nIf the owner suggests the tape volume contains the data and is needed, the system programmer should help in\r\nretrieving, recovering, and re-creating the user \u2019s data.\r\nIf the tape volume is defined to DFSMShsm as a backup volume and the volume does not physically contain any\r\nDFSMShsm backup versions but DFSMShsm thinks that valid backup versions exist on the tape volume, the system\r\nprogrammer should delete each backup version that DFSMShsm thinks is on the tape volume. To logically delete\r\neach backup version that resides on the tape backup volume, the system programmer should remove the volume\r\nfrom DFSMShsm\u2019s control by entering the following DFSMShsm space manager command: DELVOL (volser)\r\nBACKUP(PURGE)\r\nThe DELVOL command causes each valid backup version that DFSMShsm thinks is on the tape volume to be marked\r\ninvalid in the tape table of contents record TTOC) in the offline control data set (OCDS). Also, all records about this\r\nvolume are deleted from the DFSMShsm control data sets. The system programmer should consider creating a new\r\nbackup version for each data set that has a backup version deleted.\r\nIf the tape volume is defined to DFSMShsm as a migration volume and the volume does not physically contain any\r\nDFSMShsm migration copies but DFSMShsm thinks that valid migration copies exist on the tape volume, the system\r\nprogrammer should delete each migrated data set that DFSMShsm thinks is on the tape volume. To logically delete\r\neach migrated data set that resides on the tape migration, the system program should enter the following DFSMShsm\r\nspace manager command: MIGRATE VOLUME( volser DBA (0))\r\nThe MIGRATE command with the DBA parameter causes data set deletion to be performed on the tape migration\r\nlevel 2 volume. Any migrated data sets residing on the tape level 2 migration volume that are not referred to in the\r\nspecified number of days (zero) will be logically deleted. Because the number of days specified is zero, DFSMShsm\r\nlogically deletes all valid migrated data sets that reside on the volume. After data set deletion is completed on the\r\ntape migration volume, the system programmer can remove the volume from DFSMShsm\u2019s control by entering the\r\nfollowing DFSMShsm space manager command: DELVOL volser MIGRATION(PURGE)\r\nThe DELVOL command causes all records associated with the tape volume to be deleted from the DFSMShsm control\r\ndata sets. The system programmer should consider how her or she is going to recover a copy of each of the migrated\r\ndata sets that has been logically deleted during data set deletion.\r\nIf the tape volume is defined to DFSMShsm as a dump volume, the volume can be removed from the control of\r\nDFSMShsm with the following command: DELVOLvolser DUMP(PURGE)\r\nThe entire dump copy that the volume belongs to will be invalidated.\r\nSource: DFSMShsm", "ARC6290I": " ELIGIBLE DATA SETS WILL BE RENAMED FOR RECOVERNEWNAMELEVEL DURING AGGREGATE RECOVERY USING THE FOLLOWING RENAME LEVEL PAIRS: oldlevel[,...newlevel]\r\nExplanation: An ARECOVER command has been issued with the RECOVERNEWNAMELEVEL parameter.

It ended before it completed because\r\none of the following occurred:\r\nv A STOP command was issued to shut down DFSMShsm.\r\nv A SETSYS command with the EMERGENCY parameter was issued to place DFSMShsm in emergency mode.\r\nv A SETSYS command with the NOBACKUP parameter was issued to disable the backup, dump, recovery, and\r\nrestore functions.\r\nv A HOLD command with the DUMP, DUMP(AUTO), or ALL parameter was issued to suspend the dump function.\r\nv The quiesce time is the time after which no more dumps of volumes are to be started.\r\nSystem action:\r\nv If a STOP command was issued, DFSMShsm immediately ends all active volume dumps, invalidates any partial\r\ndump copies, and ends.\r\nv If a SETSYS command with the EMERGENCY or NOBACKUP parameter was issued, DFSMShsm immediately\r\nends all active volume dumps, invalidates any partial dump copies, and ends.\r\nv If a HOLD command was issued with the DUMP or DUMP(AUTO) parameter, and without the ENDOFDATASET\r\nparameter, DFSMShsm completes any volume dumps that were in progress and ends.\r\nv If a HOLD command was issued with the DUMP or DUMP(AUTO) parameter, and with the ENDOFDATASET\r\nparameter, DFSMShsm immediately ends all active volume dumps, invalidates any partial dump copies, and ends.\r\nWhen the automatic dump quiesce time is reached, DFSMShsm completes any volume dump operations that were\r\nin progress, but will not dump any additional volumes.\r\nIf SHUTDOWN is indicated, DFSMShsm processing ends.

The volume is a primary, migration, backup,\r\nor dump volume and has the volume serial number volser. This message reports the results of the delete operation.\r\nWhen the ENTRY is DELETED or MARKEDFULL, this means that the command has been successful, whereas NOT\r\nMARKEDFULL means it has not been successful.\r\nIf a DELVOL UNASSIGN command is issued for a tape migration level 2 volume, DFSMShsm marks the volume as\r\nnot selected. A selected volume is a partially full volume that still has space after completion of a prior volume or\r\ndata set migration. If the volume has not been selected, the DELVOL UNASSIGN command for this tape volume has\r\nno useful purpose.\r\nIf the result is NOT DEFINED, DFSMShsm could not find the specified volume serial number with the specified\r\nvolume type.\r\nIf the result is NOT DELETED \u2014 CDS ERROR, an error has occurred while trying to process one of the control data\r\nsets.\r\nIf the result is NOT DELETED \u2014 VALID DATA MAY EXIST ON VOLUME, an attempt has been made to issue a\r\nDELVOL command with the PURGE parameter for a tape migration level 2 volume. The offline control data set\r\n(OCDS) tape table of contents record (TTOC) indicates that the volume may contain valid migration copies, so the\r\nprocessing ends. If the PURGE parameter has been used because the ML2 tape has been lost or destroyed and fails\r\ndue to ARC0260I, issue the command MIGRATE VOLUME(xxxxxxDBA(0)), where xxxxxxis the volume, to remove\r\nall record of valid data, then issue the DELVOL PURGE command again. This should only be done when the tape is\r\ntotally unusable because it removes what may be the only copy of the data. If backup copies are available, recover\r\nthe data sets that the MIGRATE command deleted.\r\nIf the result is NOT DELETED \u2014 VOLUME INELIGIBLE FOR DELVOL, an attempt has been made to issue a\r\nDELVOL when the ineligible for DELVOL flag is on in the migration control data set volume record (MCV) of the\r\nvolume. This flag is set on when a VSAM data set migrates to tape and there has been a failure trying to update the\r\nTTOC record to reflect this migration (see related messages ARC1285I and ARC0538I). The volume still contains valid\r\nmigration copies, so DELVOL processing ends.\r\nIf the result is NOT DELETED \u2014 SELECTED BY ANOTHER HOST, an attempt has been made to issue a DELVOL\r\ncommand and it has been found that the volume is selected by another processing unit.\r\nIn a multiple processing unit environment, it is necessary to issue the DELVOL command on each of the processors\r\nto which a volume has been added by an ADDVOL command. This message will appear on each system after the\r\nfirst successful DELVOL command, in which case no further action is necessary.\r\nIf the result is NOT DELETED \u2014 CONTAINS ONLY DUMP COPY, the volume contains part of the only valid dump\r\ncopy for a primary or non-DFSMShsm-managed volume. The LASTCOPY parameter must be specified to delete such\r\na volume.\r\nIf the result is NOT DELETED \u2014 PURGE NOT SPECIFIED FOR STACKED VOLUME, an attempt has been made to\r\nissue a DELVOL command without the PURGE option, for a dump volume with more than one valid dump copy\r\nstacked on it.\r\nIf the result is NOT DELETED \u2014 COPYPOOLCOPY NOT SPECIFIED, a DELVOL command has been issued for a\r\ntape containing valid dump copies for one or more volumes defined to a copy pool. Deleting the volume would\r\ninvalidate the set of dump tapes that comprise a backup version of the copy pool.\r\nIf the result is DELETED WITH AN UPDATING COPY POOL CDS ERROR, there was an error updating the copy\r\npool CDS record after the dump volume was invalidated.\r\nIf the result is NOT DELETED \u2014VOLUME IS PART OF THE LAST DUMP VERSION, a user has issued a DELVOL\r\ncommand without LASTCOPY specified and the dump volume is part of the last dump version for the copy pool.\r\nIf the result is NOT DELETED \u2014 ANOTHER DFSMShsm FUNCTION WAS PROCESSING THE COPY POOL, a user\r\nhas issued a DELVOL command while another function is still processing the copy pool.\r\nIf the result is NOT DELETED \u2014 COPY POOL DUMP VOLUME, a user has issued a DELVOL command on a\r\nprevious system other than the z/OS V1R11 system for a dump volume from a copy pool version processed on a\r\nz/OS V1R11 or later system.\r\nIf a DELVOL command with the PURGE parameter is entered for a tape backup volume that contains active and\r\nvalid backup versions, the control data set records associated with each valid version are updated or deleted so the\r\nvalid versions are no longer recorded in the control data sets. If all valid versions are successfully processed, the\r\nrecords associated with the volume are deleted or updated and the message indicates the number of valid versions\r\nthat have been deleted. If DFSMShsm encounters at least one error while deleting records associated with valid\r\nversions, the message will indicate NOT DELETED \u2014 ERROR REMOVING VALID DATA.\r\nAn internal DELVOL causes the message to be issued under the following conditions:\r\nv If the DFSMShsm TAPEDELETION option is HSMTAPE, either the backup control data set backup volume record\r\n(MCV) or MCT record, or both, and the TTOC record are kept (the base TTOC and the TTOC extensions are\r\ndeleted).

MARKFULL is only valid for tape. If the result is MARKFULL READERROR, DFSMShsm has been\r\nunable to read the volume record. If the result is NOT MARKEDFULL, a DELVOL command with the MARKFULL\r\nparameter has failed while attempting to update CDS records.\r\nIf the result is NOT DELETED - COPY POOL DUMP VOLUME, a DELVOL command has been issued on a pre z/OS\r\nV1R11 system for a dump volume from a copy pool version processed on a z/OS V1R11 or later system.\r\nIf the result is NOT DELETED - RETAINED BACKUP COPY EXISTS ON VOLUME, a DELVOL command was issued\r\nand DFSMShsm encountered a volume that might contain one or more retained backup versions for which\r\nRETAINDAYS was specified at the time of backup.

The tape volume is rejected by the DFSMShsm volume\r\nverification exit for one of the following reasons:\r\nv The tape volume mounted already contains valid DFSMShsm data.\r\nv The tape volume mounted is RACF-protected, but does not appear in DFSMShsm\u2019s RACF tape volume set of\r\nHSMHSM or DFHSMx (where x is the last nonblank character of the tape volume\u2019s volser).\r\nv The tape volume mounted is defined to DFSMShsm as a backup volume and a migration volume is required.\r\nv The tape volume mounted is defined to DFSMShsm, as a migration volume and a backup volume is required.\r\nv The tape volume mounted is defined to DFSMShsm as a dump volume, but a migration volume is required.\r\nv The tape volume mounted is defined to DFSMShsm as a dump volume, but a backup volume is required.\r\nv The tape volume mounted is defined to DFSMShsm as a backup volume, but a dump volume is required.\r\nv The tape volume mounted is defined to DFSMShsm as a migration volume, but a dump volume is required.\r\nv The dump class to which the volume is currently assigned does not match the dump class to which it is dumped.\r\nv A volume is mounted for output on an allocated device after a previous mount for output during the processing of\r\nthe same function.\r\nv The media which is mounted is WORM and this function is not supported for WORM.\r\nv The tape volume mounted is defined to DFSMShsm with TTOC type which does not match the current SETSYS\r\nEXTENDEDTTOC(Y|N) setting.\r\nSystem action: A keep message is sent for the tape volume. The tape volume is rewound and unloaded by OPEN or\r\nEOV processing and a mount message is sent for another tape volume. If the SELECTVOLUME option is SPECIFIC,\r\nand it is OPEN processing, DFSMShsm attempts to select another tape volume already defined to DFSMShsm. If\r\nthere are three consecutive specific volumes mounted and rejected with an ARC0309I message, the operator receives\r\na nonspecific (PRIVAT) mount request. If it is EOV processing, DFSMShsm attempts to select another tape volume\r\nalready defined to DFSMShsm without regard to the number of rejections occurring with an ARC0309I message for\r\nthis mount. If DFSMShsm is able to select another tape volume, the operator receives a specific mount request. If\r\nDFSMShsm is unable to select another tape volume or the SELECTVOLUME option is SCRATCH, the operator\r\nreceives a nonspecific (PRIVAT) mount request. If the message indicates that WORM media is not valid for this\r\nfunction then the system will end OPEN processing.\r\nOperator response: The tape operator should respond to the specific mount request by mounting the requested tape\r\nvolume on the requested tape drive.\r\nThe tape operator can respond to the nonspecific (PRIVAT) mount request by mounting a scratch tape or a tape\r\nvolume already defined to DFSMShsm on the requested tape drive. If the tape operator mounts a scratch tape, the\r\ntape should not be RACF-protected by another user nor used previously for output by the DFSMShsm function\r\nissuing the message. If the tape operator mounts a tape volume already defined to DFSMShsm, the tape volume\r\nshould not contain any valid DFSMShsm data (it should be empty) and should not be RACF-protected by another\r\nuser. Also, the type of tape volume mounted (backup, migration, or dump) should be the same as the type of tape\r\nvolume that encountered the EOV condition. To resolve a TTOC conflict, the tape operator can mount a tape volume\r\nwith a compatible TTOC type.\r\nProgrammer response: The system programmer determines what valid DFSMShsm data already exists on the tape\r\nvolume by entering the DFSMShsm space manager LIST command. For level 2 migration tape volumes and backup\r\nand SPILL tape volumes, issue the LIST command with the TTOC parameter. For dump volumes, issue the LIST\r\ncommand with the DUMPVOLUMES parameter.\r\nIf the message indicates the tape volume does not appear in one of DFSMShsm\u2019s RACF tape volume sets, see z/OS\r\nDFSMShsm Implementation and Customization Guide sections \u201cAuthorizing and Protecting DFSMShsm Resources\u201d and\r\n\u201cImplementing DFSMShsm Tape Environments\u201d for a description of how to add tape volumes to DFSMShsm\u2019s RACF\r\ntape volume sets.\r\nIf the message indicates the dump classes are in conflict, use the DELVOL command with the UNASSIGN parameter\r\nfor the dump volume so the volume can be used in any other dump class for subsequent dumps.\r\nIf the message indicates the tape volume is RACF-protected by another user, the system programmer should request\r\nthe RACF security administrator look into the matter. The RACF security administrator can determine if the tape\r\nvolume is RACF-protected, and by whom, by entering the following RACF command:\r\nRLIST TAPEVOL volser ALL\r\nThe sender of the command must have a certain level of access authority to the resource depending on the\r\ninformation requested.

This message contains\r\ninformation about the migration control data set (MCDS), backup control data set (BCDS), offline control data set\r\n(OCDS), or journal data set. DFSMShsm issues this message once for each control data set and the journal data set.\r\nNote: If a number is concatenated to the CDS name (such as MCDS2), then the message refers to a single volume of\r\na multicluster CDS.\r\nFor JOURNAL, the end of the data set figure used in the following calculations is based on the last journal updates\r\non the host that the message was issued on. Dpdates made on another host might have extended the actual end of\r\nthe data set.\r\nTOTAL SPACE=kbytes K-BYTES is the total space allocated in kilobytes. This space figure is based on the amount of\r\nspace between the beginning and end of the data set (high-allocated). If the data set is defined so it can extend, this\r\nvalue increases. This value is used as the denominator in the calculation of the % FULL and % FREESPACE as\r\ndescribed later in this section.\r\nCURRENTLY ABOUT percent% FULL is the percentage of space used in the data set.\r\nThe numerator is the amount of space between the beginning of the data set and the high-used point in the data set.\r\nFor the CDSs, DFSMShsm does not subtract the free space below the high-used point, since free space below can still\r\nexist when VSAM indicates the data set is full. For example, there can be free space in some control intervals (CI)\r\nand control areas (CA) below the high-used point in a key-sequenced data set (KSDS); however, an insert of a new\r\nlogical record can still receive a return code indicating an out-of-space condition if there is no more space available\r\nabove the high-used point in the KSDS. Space utilization in a VSAM KSDS is dependent on the location of a new\r\nrecord insert. For example, space must be free in the CI, or a CI must be free in the CA where the insert is to be\r\nperformed. Otherwise, VSAM tries to obtain a new CA after the high-used point to split the current CA.\r\nThe denominator is the TOTAL SPACE in the data set as described above.\r\nThis value might vary in size if the data set is defined so it can extend, or if records are inserted or deleted.\r\nWARNING THRESHOLD=thresh% is the installation-specified threshold percentage of occupancy specified by the\r\nSETSYS MONITOR command which, when exceeded, issues a warning message (ARC0909E).\r\nTOTAL FREESPACE= percent% is the percentage of free space (not occupied).\r\nFor the CDSs, the numerator is the free space in the data set as indicated in a LISTCAT command plus the free space\r\nbetween the high-used and the end of the data set (high-allocated). For the journal, the numerator is the free space\r\nbetween the high-used point and the end of the data set.\r\nThe denominator is the TOTAL SPACE as described above.\r\nEA={YES | NO}: indicates whether or not the CDS is defined as an extended addressability (EA) data set. EA=NO is\r\nalways indicated for the Journal data set.\r\nCANDIDATE VOLUMES=numvols is a number of candidate volumes for the CDS. For the Journal data set, numvols is\r\nalways be zero.\r\nSpecial Note:\r\nFor the CDSs, percent% FULL+percent% TOTAL FREESPACE is not intended to add up to 100% unless a reorganization\r\nwith freespace (0 0) was recently completed. This is due to the difference in the way freespace is handled in the two\r\ncalculations to make the statistics regarding the CDSs more useful. The percent% FULL calculation counts all space\r\nbetween the beginning of the data set and the high-used point (HURBA) as used space in the data set. DFSMShsm\r\ndoes not subtract the freespace below the high-used point for the reasons described above. Whereas the\r\npercent% TOTAL FREESPACE calculation counts all empty CIs, not just the ones above the high-used point. Both\r\nstatistics are useful for making decisions regarding the CDSs. If this QUERY CDS was issued in response to the ARC0909E warning message, we recommend you perform the following actions:\r\n1. Follow the system programmer Response in the ARC0909E message to reclaim fragmented space and allocate a\r\nlarger control data set (if necessary) when the percent% FULL value is high.\r\n2. Monitor your CDS usage when the percent% FULL value is in the mid to high range but the TOTAL FREESPACE\r\nvalue is high. If TOTAL FREESPACE decreases andpercent% FULL does not change much, then most of the new\r\ndata is being inserted into the already available freespace and action can be delayed.

Message ARC0560E or ARC0559I was issued to the operator \u2019s console and to the migration activity log\r\nindicating the unavailable resource.\r\nSystem action: If the HOLD command was issued with the AUTOMIGRATION or MIGRATION parameter, no new\r\nspace management operations are started. For volume space management operations that are in progress, the\r\nENDOFDATASET or ENDOFVOLUME parameter that was specified with the HOLD command determines where the\r\nprocessing stops. If ENDOFDATASET was specified, all volume migration operations end at the completion of the\r\ncurrent data set. If ENDOFVOLUME was specified, DFSMShsm completes any volume migration operations that are\r\nin progress.\r\nWhen the automatic primary space management ending time is reached, DFSMShsm completes any volume\r\nmigration operations that are in progress, but no new volume space management operations are started. DFSMShsm\r\nstarts the function again today only if a new start time is redefined as after the last ending time.\r\nIf the STOP command or SETSYS command with the EMERGENCY parameter was issued, all volume migration\r\noperations end at the completion of the current data set, and no new volume migration operations are started.\r\nDFSMShsm processing continues.\r\nProgrammer response: If primary space management ends prior to completion because resources are not available,\r\nsee message ARC0560E or ARC0559I, which are issued to the operator \u2019s console and the migration activity log. This\r\nmessage indicates which resource DFSMShsm found unavailable and the appropriate programmer response to the\r\nproblem.\r\nAutomatic primary space management can be restarted at the point of interruption by issuing one of the following\r\ncommands:\r\nv Restart (START) DFSMShsm when shutdown is completed.\r\nv RELEASE AUTOMIGRATION when auto space management is held.\r\nv RELEASE MIGRATION when migration is held.\r\nv SETSYS NOEMERGENCY when DFSMShsm is in emergency mode.\r\nv SETSYS PRIMARYSPMGMTSTART when the current time is within the specified automatic primary space\r\nmanagement start window.\r\nFor automatic primary space management to resume at the point of interruption, the command must take effect\r\nbefore 24-hours pass. This ensures that the current time and the time automatic primary space management is first\r\nstarted are still within the start window for automatic primary space management.\r\nThe suggested way to extend the start window and thereby cause the continuation of PSM is to respecify the\r\nautomatic primary space management start time as having the same planned start time that already exists, but with a\r\nquiesce time later than the current time.\r\nIf the PSMSTART is set to (2300 0100) and the current time is 0210, enter SETSYS PSMSTART (2300 0400) and the\r\nPSM continues from where it left off and runs to completion, or until 0400 which ever comes first.\r\nWhen automatic primary space management ends because the ending time is reached, it cannot resume because the\r\ncurrent time is no longer within the start window.\r\nSource: DFSMShsm", "ARC0434E": " RECYCLE FAILED - DSN= dsnameON VOLUME=volser - DATA SET DELETED\r\nExplanation: During processing of a RECYCLE command with the FORCE parameter, an error occurred while\r\nreading the input data set within the 3480 single-file tape listed as volser.

This recovers the data set to a non-SMS-managed volume.\r\n14 Issue a data set RECOVER command with the TOVOLUME parameter specifying an SMS-managed volume\r\nthat has a device type similar to the original volume that has been dumped. This restores the data set to an\r\nSMS-managed volume.\r\n20 Do one of the following:\r\nv Preallocate the SMS VSAM data set.\r\nv Have the recover request issued by a DFSMShsm authorized user.\r\nv If the data set is not preallocated, a DEFINE CLUSTER RECATALOG IDCAMS command must be issued\r\nafter the restore is complete.\r\n24 Ensure the ACS routine does not target the data set to a pool of volumes with smaller track sizes than the\r\noriginal source device. Ensure that at least one volume in the volume pool has enough free space to honor\r\nthe allocation request.

The tape volume has been RACF-protected by DFSMShsm for the following reason:\r\nv The tape security option specified with the TAPESECURITY parameter of the SETSYS command is either RACF or\r\nRACFINCLUDE. DFSMShsm has selected the tape volume for use during migration, backup, dump, or aggregate\r\nbackup and recovery processing.\r\nIf the message indicates the tape volume has been successfully deleted from DFSMShsm\u2019s RACF tape volume set,\r\nDFSMShsm has removed the RACF protection of the tape volume by removing the volume serial number from\r\nDFSMShsm\u2019s RACF tape volume set of either HSMHSM, DFHSMx, or HSMABR. DFSMShsm has removed the RACF\r\nprotection of the tape volume for one of the following reasons:\r\nv The tape volume has been successfully recycled and the TAPEDELETION option specified with the SETSYS\r\ncommand is SCRATCHTAPE. Because the TAPEDELETION option is SCRATCHTAPE, the tape volume is being\r\nremoved from DFSMShsm\u2019s control. All DFSMShsm control data set records related to this tape volume are being\r\ndeleted and the RACF protection is being removed by deleting the volume serial number from DFSMShsm\u2019s RACF\r\ntape volume set.\r\nv The percent of valid data on the tape volume has decreased to zero, causing the tape volume to be automatically\r\nrecycled. The TAPEDELETION option specified on the SETSYS command is SCRATCHTAPE. Because the\r\nTAPEDELETION option is SCRATCHTAPE, the tape volume is being removed from DFSMShsm\u2019s control. All\r\nDFSMShsm control data set records related to this tape volume are being deleted and the RACF protection is being\r\nremoved by deleting the volume serial number from DFSMShsm\u2019s RACF tape volume set.\r\nv An authorized user has issued a DELVOL command with the PURGE option for the tape volume. The tape volume\r\nis being removed from DFSMShsm\u2019s control. All DFSMShsm control data set records related to this tape volume\r\nare being deleted and the RACF protection is being removed by deleting the volume serial number from\r\nDFSMShsm\u2019s RACF tape volume set.\r\nv A dump volume containing part of a valid dump copy has completed dump copy expiration processing. The\r\nTAPEDELETION parameter of the SETSYS command is SCRATCHTAPE. Because the parameter is\r\nSCRATCHTAPE, the tape volume is removed from control of DFSMShsm. Since the tape volume has been\r\nRACF-protected by DFSMShsm in the past, RACF protection is now removed from the tape volume.\r\nv The tape volume has been RACF-protected by DFSMShsm some time in the past. The tape volume is now empty\r\nand DFSMShsm has selected the tape volume for reuse during backup or migration processing. The tape security\r\noption currently in effect is not RACF or RACFINCLUDE. Because the tape volume is being overwritten and the\r\ntape security option currently in effect is not RACF or RACFINCLUDE, DFSMShsm is removing the RACF\r\nprotection of the tape volume by deleting the volume serial number from DFSMShsm\u2019s RACF tape volume set.\r\nv The tape volume contains DFSMShsm ABARS data for an expired aggregate version and is being deleted as a\r\nresult of aggregate version rolloff during ABACKUP, ARECOVER, or EXPIREBV ABARSVERSIONS processing.\r\nSystem action: DFSMShsm processing continues.\r\nProgrammer response: This is only an informational message for the storage administrator or system programmer\r\nresponsible for DFSMShsm operations and the RACF security administrator.

For additional information, seez/OS Security\r\nServer RACF Command Language Reference .\r\nIf you have RACF-protected a tape volume by adding the tape volume to a DFSMShsm RACF tape volume set, you\r\nare responsible for removing the RACF protection from that tape volume when the tape volume is removed from\r\nDFSMShsm\u2019s control. DFSMShsm only removes the RACF protection from tape volumes it has RACF-protected. If\r\nyou have protected the tape volume using one of the commands discussed above, you can remove the RACF\r\nprotection from the tape volume by deleting the volume serial number from one of DFSMShsm\u2019s RACF tape volume\r\nsets.

The message ARC1158I may be received during Volume\r\nRestore with APPLYINCREMENTAL processing if the multiple volume data set is in the Dump Copy VTOC\r\nor the Backup Copy VTOC being processed. For example, the message is issued when the Restore process\r\nrestored a segment of a multiple volume data set, but not all segments of the data set were restored since\r\nsome segments reside on other volumes. If the multiple volume data set was backed up from the volume\r\nwhere the base is cataloged, then a more recent backup copy may exist. Because VSAM data sets have\r\nmultiple components, more than one message may be received for the same VSAM sphere.\r\n38 An extended format data set is filtered by ACS routines to be recovered or restored to a non-SMS-managed\r\nvolume.\r\n40 The data set is currently uncataloged, but the backup version is a cataloged data set.\r\n44 FROMVOLUME is specified to recover or restore an extended format data set to a non-SMS-managed\r\nvolume.\r\n46 Cataloged extended format data sets are not recovered by Incremental Volume Recovery or by full Volume\r\nRestore during the APPLYINCREMENTAL process. The message ARC1158I may be received during Volume\r\nRestore with APPLYINCREMENTAL processing if the extended format data set is in the Dump Copy VTOC\r\nor the Backup Copy VTOC being processed. For example, the message is issued when the Restore process\r\nrestored a segment of an extended format data set, but not all segments of the data set were restored since\r\nsome segments reside on other volumes. If the extended format data set was backed up from the volume\r\nwhere the first portion of the data set is cataloged, then a more recent backup copy may exist. Because\r\nVSAM data sets have multiple components, more than one message may be received for the same VSAM\r\nsphere.\r\n48 The data set organization of the target data set differs from the data set organization of the original data set\r\nfrom which the cataloged data set was backed up.\r\n50 A preallocated target with record level sharing (RLS) attributes was found.

This exceeds the architectural limit for systems\r\nprior to V1R13.\r\nSystem action: The recovery operation of this data set ends. DFSMShsm processing continues.\r\nFor reason code 36, the RECOVER command ends because DFSMShsm does not recover multiple volume data sets\r\nduring a volume recovery process.

If the\r\nVSAM base cluster is preallocated, it must be the same type (LDS, KSDS, ESDS, or RRDS) as the VSAM data\r\nset being recovered.\r\n12 Either select a backup version whose data set organization agrees with the data set organization of the\r\ncurrently cataloged data set, or specify old and new data set names of data sets that agree in data set\r\norganization.\r\n16 Delete the cataloged data set already on the target volume, move the existing data set to another volume, or\r\nspecify a different target volume with the TOVOLUME parameter.\r\n21 Use V1R12 or higher to recover the data set.\r\n22 Verify the backup version contains good data. If not, notify your system programmer. If the backup version\r\nis good, the MCCFDMV flag could be accidentally turned off by a DFSMShsm-authorized user through a\r\nFIXCDS PATCH command. Issue a FIXCDS PATCH command to turn on MCCFDMV flag and then reissue\r\nthe RECOVER command to recover the extended format data set.\r\n23 Determine which field, MCCFLFS or MCCFDMV, is in error and use the FIXCDS command to correct it.\r\nReissue the RECOVER command for the data set.\r\n26 or 30\r\nSee z/OS DFSMShsm Storage Administration in the section titled, \u201cAvailability Management Procedures\u201d\r\nunder the topic, \u201cBacking Up and Recovering an ICF Catalog\u201d.\r\n32 To recover the backup version, issue a RECOVER or HRECOVER command for the data set and specify the\r\nREPLACE parameter.\r\n34 Reissue the RECOVER command with the FROMDUMP(DUMPVOLUME) parameter to restore each\r\nextended format of the data set. To find out the DUMPVOLUME which contains the physical full volume\r\ndump copy of the data set, issue a LIST command with the PVOL BCDS ALLDUMPS parameter to retrieve\r\nthe information about dump copies and dump volumes of the primary volume. Then issue LIST commands\r\nwith DVOL DUMPCONTENTS to retrieve the information about the dump copies of the data set. If the data\r\nset no longer exists before the restore, the data set must be cataloged by the user after all extended formats\r\nare restored. Neither DFSMSdss nor DFSMShsm catalogs the multivolume extended format data set during\r\nphysical dump copy restore processing.\r\n36 DFSMShsm does not recover a cataloged multiple volume data set during Volume Recovery or during\r\nVolume Restore with APPLYINCREMENTAL processing. This provides the opportunity to work with the\r\nindividual data set. If the Volume Restore restored the part of the data set that resided on this volume, and\r\nreturn code 58 and reason code 46 of message ARC0734I were received from the APPLYINCREMENTAL\r\nprocess, then the restored part of the data set may be down level. Determine the type of action required for\r\nthis data set. You can rescue or repair data with REPRO, BLDINDX or similar utilities. Otherwise, you can\r\nrecover using individual data set requests, such as with the RECOVER or HRECOVER data set commands.\r\n38 Modify the ACS filter routine to direct the extended format data set to be recovered or restored to\r\nSMS-managed volumes. DFSMShsm does not recover or restore an extended format data set to\r\nnon-SMS-managed volumes.\r\n44 Reissue the RECOVER command without specifying the FROMVOLUME parameter. DFSMShsm does not\r\nrecover or restore an extended format data set to non-SMS-managed volumes.\r\n46 DFSMShsm does not recover an extended format data set that spans multiple volumes during Volume\r\nRecovery or during Volume Restore with APPLYINCREMENTAL processing. This provides the opportunity\r\nto work with the individual data set. If the Volume Restore restored the part of the data set that resided on\r\nthis volume, and return code 58 and reason code 46 of message ARC0734I were received from the\r\nAPPLYINCREMENTAL process, then the restored part of the data set may be down level.

Otherwise, you can recover using individual data set requests, such as with RECOVER or\r\nHRECOVER data set commands.\r\n48 Check the data set organization of the target data set. If the selected backup version was cataloged when the\r\nbackup copy was made, then the organization of the target data set must have the same data set\r\norganization as the original data set from which the backup version was made.\r\n50 To maintain the record level sharing (RLS) information in the target data set, use DFSMShsm 1.3.0 or higher.\r\nTo perform the recovery using a down-level system, delete the preallocated target or delete the RLS\r\nattributes.

If the processor will be unavailable for an extended time and you want to issue a\r\nDEFINE command with the MIGRATIONLEVEL2 parameter, the DFSMShsm migration control data set migration\r\ncontrol record (MCR) for the inoperative processor must be modified. Enter a FIXCDS command for the MCR\r\nrecord for the inoperative processor so that DFSMShsm will set off the indicator that migration to level 2 DASD is\r\nrunning. This indicator is MCRFML2.

Since\r\nfurther processing may depend on the contents of this catalog, the process ends.\r\n12 An error occurred in allocating the backup or dump VTOC copy data set.\r\n14 An error occurred in reading the backup or dump VTOC copy data set.\r\n15 Obtain of the format-1/format-8 DSCB of the VTOC copy data set failed.\r\n16 An error occurred in opening the backup or dump VTOC copy data set.\r\n18 The VTOC copy data set has a format-8 DSCB.\r\n20 The required backup or dump tape volumes are not available.\r\n22 The volume does not have both backup and dump VTOC copy data sets to use to build a list of candidate\r\ndata sets for recovery.\r\n24 An invalid or unsupported device type was found for the source backup, dump volume, or the migration\r\nlevel 1 volume where the VTOC copy data set resides, in its control data set record.\r\n25 APPLYINCREMENTAL processing is not allowed because the volume contained a VSAM catalog the last\r\ntime DFSMShsm dumped or backed up the volume.\r\n26 APPLYINCREMENTAL processing is not allowed for DFSMShsm owned volumes because these volumes are\r\nnot supported for the volume backup function.\r\n27 APPLYINCREMENTAL processing is not allowed because the correct level of the Data Facility Product\r\n(DFP) is not installed on the system. The correct level of the DFP required to support this function is Release\r\n2 Version 3 or subsequent releases, unless otherwise noted.\r\n28 The MCV record that describes the volume on where the dump VTOC copy resides indicates that the\r\nvolume is not a migration level 1 volume.\r\n30 SMS has not been active in the system when DFSMShsm has attempted to process SMS-managed volumes.\r\n32 DFSMShsm cannot determine if the volume being processed is an SMS-managed volume. The SMS volume\r\ndefinition and the volume VTOC entry do not agree.\r\n34 An error has occurred while retrieving an SMS volume definition. DFSMShsm has invoked SMS to retrieve\r\nan SMS volume definition. SMS has failed to retrieve it.\r\n52 A GETMAIN error occurred in getting storage for the recovery queue elements.\r\n60 An error occurred in establishing an ESTAE environment.\r\n66 An internal error occurred in sorting the queue of recovery queue elements (RQEs). The queue was broken.\r\nSystem action: The restore process is performed. The incremental volume recovery is not performed. DFSMShsm\r\nprocessing continues.\r\nProgrammer response: If the volume contains an owning VSAM catalog, ensure that the catalog has been recovered\r\nwith the latest backup copy and is in a usable state. DFSMShsm does not back up and recover VSAM catalogs. If the\r\nvolume has been processed by volume backup, a volume recovery can be requested when the state of the catalog has\r\nbeen verified.\r\nIf the recovery of a catalog failed, determine if the catalog is usable and recent enough. If it is not, issue the\r\nRECOVER command for the catalog. If the catalog is usable or a later RECOVER command for the catalog\r\nsucceeded, issue the RECOVER command for the volume again without the FROMDUMP and\r\nAPPLYINCREMENTAL parameters and specify the date the volume was restored.\r\nUse V1R12 or higher to recover volume if VTOC copy data set has a format-8 DSCB.\r\nSource: DFSMShsm", "ARC0736I": " BACKUP OF MIGRATED DATA SETS ENDING AT time , nds DATA SETS BACKED UP\r\nExplanation: BACKUP processing of any eligible data sets that have migrated has been ended. The time of day the\r\nBACKUP processing has ended istime , expressed as hh:mm:ss (hours, minutes, seconds). The number of migrated\r\ndata sets that was backed up isnds.\r\nSystem action: DFSMShsm processing continues.\r\nProgrammer response: None.\r\nSource: DFSMShsm", "ARC1388W": " DATA SET BACKUP {DASD | TAPE} TASKS ALLOWED IS REDUCED FROM mm TO nn\r\nExplanation: While performing data set backup, a required resource was not available. If tape tasks is indicated, the\r\nmaximum number (mm) of allowed tasks has been reduced because tape resources were not available.\r\nSystem action: Data set backup continues, using the new value (nn). If nnis reduced to zero and data set backup\r\ngoes to tape, DFSMShsm will continue to back up data sets to ML1 DASD that are below the value specified by\r\nDASDSELECTIONSIZE(maximum), or that specify the TARGET(DASD) on the backup command.\r\nOperator response: Notify the system programmer.\r\nSystem programmer response: Correct the problem that led up to the mount refusal and ensure that enough tape\r\ndrives are available to satisfy the number of tapes allowed on DFSMShsm. After correcting these problems, either\r\nrelease data set backup or change the data set backup SETSYS values so that DFSMShsm uses new values for the\r\nnumber of allowed tasks.\r\nSource: DFSMShsm"}
