DB2 requires an LCV size that is large enough to handle all pages in the member's buffer pool.\r\nlength1 indicates the LCV size (in number of bits) that DB2 requested. length2 indicates the LCV size (in number of\r\nbits) that XES was able to allocate.\r\nTo prevent flooding the operator console, this message is only issued once per DB2 member per group buffer pool\r\nuntil the condition is corrected.\r\nSystem action: DB2 disconnects from the GBP and issues message DSNB301E with reason code 00C20208, if it has\r\nnot yet been issued.\r\nSQLCODE -904 is returned to the user with a reason code of 00C20208.\r\nSystem programmer response: There is not enough HSA storage on the processor to support the size of the local\r\ncache vector. The details of HSA allocation are machine-dependent and are defined by the hardware. To correct this\r\nproblem, take one or both of the following actions:\r\nv Consult the documentation for your processor hardware to determine if the HSA storage allocation can be\r\nincreased, and if so, how to do it.\r\nv Modify the software configuration in your parallel sysplex to reduce the number or size of the vectors that are in\r\nuse by other coupling facility structure users. Consider the following possible solutions:\r\n\u2013 Use the DB2 ALTER BUFFERPOOL command to reduce the size of this local buffer pool. This means that you\r\nmight have to reduce the size of the virtual pool.\r\n\u2013 Use the DB2 ALTER BUFFERPOOL command to reduce the size of another local buffer pool that is already\r\nconnected to a group buffer pool. This means that you might have to reduce the size of the virtual pool. If you\r\nmake a connected buffer pool smaller, DB2 can usually contract the size of the corresponding LCV dynamically,\r\nmaking HSA storage available. However, DB2 cannot always do the dynamic LCV contraction. In cases where\r\nDB2 cannot dynamically contract the LCV size, you can use the DB2 ALTER BUFFERPOOL command to either\r\nforce a deallocation of the LCV or to force a contraction of the LCV as follows:\r\n1. Redefine the virtual pool to be smaller than the original size.\r\n2. Take one of the following actions:\r\na. Make the virtual pool very small (perhaps 50 pages or less). Making the virtual pool sufficiently small\r\nshould let DB2 dynamically contract the LCV, or\r\nb. Delete the virtual pool to let DB2 disconnect from the group buffer pool. This frees the entire LCV\r\nassociated with that member's connection to that group buffer pool.\r\n\u2013 Consolidate your group buffer pool-dependent page sets into fewer buffer pools to reduce the number of group\r\nbuffer pool connections.\r\n\u2013 Consult the documentation for the other software components that might be using a coupling facility cache or\r\nlist structure with an associated LCV to determine whether it is possible to either delete the connection or to\r\nreduce the size of the LCV associated with the connection.", "DSNH750I": " INVALID DATA SET: clist-keyword clist-keyword-parameter\r\nExplanation: The data set name specified on the clist-keyword-parameter contains unbalanced parenthesis.\r\nThis message is issued by the following CLIST: DSNH\r\nSystem action: The CLIST is terminated.\r\nUser response: If a member name is to be associated with the specified data set, the member name must be\r\nenclosed in parentheses.\r\nSeverity: 8 (error)", "DSNV517I": " csect-name - ENDING STORAGE CONTRACTION MODE\r\nExplanation: DB2 has detected paging has ceased and begins to cache unused virtual pages.\r\ncsect-name\r\nThe name of the control section that issued the message.\r\nSystem action: Processing continues.\r\nUser response: No action is required.", "DSNL094I": " WLMHEALTH=health-value CLSDCONQN=number-closed CLSDCONQW=wait-closed\r\nExplanation: This message is a section of output from the DISPLAY DDF command, which is part of message\r\n\u201cDSNL080I\u201d on page 321.", "DSNL519I": " csect TCP/IP SERVICES AVAILABLE FOR DOMAIN domain AND PORT tcpport\r\nExplanation: DB2 is ready to accept connections on any IP address supported by the TCP/IP stack.

TERMINAL CCSID terminal-ccsid. SPUFI CCSID: spufi-ccsid. NOTIFY THE DB2 SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR.\r\nExplanation: The current SPUFI session was initiated on a TSO terminal that uses a coded character set identifier\r\n(CCSID) of terminal-ccsid. However, SPUFI was bound on the local DB2 server using a CCSID of spufi-ccsid. This\r\ndiscrepancy can lead to unexpected data conversion, affecting any characters that do not map to the same code point\r\nin the two CCSIDs.\r\nIf terminal-ccsid is blank, then the terminal code page and character set cannot be queried or they are not supported\r\nby ISPF. Possible reasons why the terminal code page and character set cannot be queried include:\r\nv Hardware limitation such as use of older terminals\r\nv Improper configuration of the terminal emulator software\r\nv Improper BTAM or control unit setup\r\nA blank spufi-ccsid indicates that SPUFI might have received an unexpected SQLCODE when it attempted to query\r\nthe current application encoding scheme. Diagnostics for that SQLCODE appear directly after the DSNE345I message\r\nin the message warning panel.\r\nSystem action: SPUFI waits for the user to indicate whether to continue or quit.\r\nSystem programmer response: On the local DB2, SPUFI expects to process only EBCDIC character data encoded in\r\nthe CCSID of spufi-ccsid. Ensure that the user's TSO terminal configuration is updated to use a CCSID of spufi-ccsid.\r\nVerify the data integrity of all tables modified during the SPUFI session and follow standard recovery procedures.\r\nContact IBM for guidance if widespread or long term data corruption is evident (for example, if many users report\r\nthis message when using SPUFI).\r\nSpecial considerations:\r\nBlank CCSIDs\r\nAs noted previously, a blank terminal-ccsid setting occurs when the terminal code page and character set\r\ncannot be queried or they are not supported by ISPF. Check for the following situations:\r\nv If the message occurs when using a terminal emulator, verify that the emulator software is configured\r\nwith a CCSID setting.\r\nv Check the VTAM? setup: The VTAM logmode entry used to define the session characteristics for the\r\nterminal must have the EDS (extended data stream) bit turned 'on' in the PSERVIC (that is,\r\npservic=xx80xx..). For more information, consult OS/390 ISPF Planning and Customization and the z/OS\r\nSNA Network Implementation Guide.\r\nv Older terminal hardware such as the IBM 327x series do not support the EDS, so a CCSID cannot be\r\ndetermined. You can instruct users of such devices to specify in the SPUFI defaults panel that the DSNE345I message should be suppressed. Note that suppression applies only when the terminal CCSID is\r\nblank. You cannot use this field to suppress DSNE345I when terminal-ccsid is non-blank.\r\nA blank spufi-ccsid indicates that SPUFI probably received an unexpected SQLCODE when it attempted to query the\r\ncurrent application encoding scheme.

The connection-id, correlation-id, and logical-unit-of-work-id values identify the user or application\r\nthat encountered the problem.

If the logical-unit-of-work-id\r\nvalue is not '*', the logical-unit-of-work-id value is a logical unit of work identifier (LUWID) that is assigned to the\r\nthread, followed by an '=' (equal sign) and a token value, which can be used in place of the LUWID in any DB2\r\ncommand that accepts the LUWID value as input.\r\nMessages that have the same connection-id, correlation-id, and logical-unit-of-work-id values relate to the same user.

The DBMS at 'location' performed a cold start. The DB2 participant assumes that the coordinator recovery\r\nlog was lost or damaged and indoubt thread resolution cannot be achieved. There is probably inconsistent data at the\r\ncoordinator. A list of indoubt threads involving the coordinator 'location' can be displayed using the DISPLAY\r\nTHREAD command for indoubt type threads by including the LOCATION('location') parameter in the command.\r\nThe heuristic decision (that is, to commit or abort the logical unit of work) should be coordinated with any other\r\nparticipants. The existence of other participants might not be easy to determine. The information might be available\r\nin the coordinators recovery log even though the coordinator performed a cold start. If the coordinator is a DB2, then\r\nit might be possible to execute the DSN1LOGP utility to produce a summary report. If this is possible, the following\r\ninformation might be produced:\r\nv The LUWID of the thread.\r\nv The NID used by IMS or CICS to identify the thread.\r\nv The name of all participants.\r\nv The name of an upstream coordinator if the coordinator is also a participant.

(The local DB2 might be the third system in this scenario.)\r\nAt this DB2 participant, all indoubt threads coordinated by the cold starting location must be resolved with the\r\nRECOVER INDOUBT command. Locked data remains unavailable until resolution. Threads that were already\r\nresolved with this command are discarded.

In this situation, the\r\nTWOPASS SQL processing option helps by processing DECLARE statements before the other types of statements.\r\nHowever, host variable declarations and cursor declarations are processed in the same pass. The host variables that\r\nare referenced in cursor declarations must be defined before the cursor is defined in the application program. This\r\nrule applies regardless of whether the ONEPASS or TWOPASS SQL processing option is used.\r\nv A parameter marker is expected rather than a host variable in an EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement.\r\nv The data type of a host variable that is passed in a CALL statement is not CHAR or VARCHAR.\r\nv The length attribute of a CHAR or VARCHAR host variable that is passed in a CALL statement exceeds 255\r\ncharacters.\r\nv If you are using the precompiler for COBOL, check whether the named host variable is declared in a structure that\r\ncontains FILLER elements.

There are two tokens associated with the coordinator information that are delimited by a dash (-) for SNA\r\nconnections, and by a double period (..) for TCP/IP connections.\r\nv The first token is the partner location name or \"<luname>\" for an SNA connection, or the IP address for the\r\nTCP/IP connection.\r\nv The second token is the partner LU name for an SNA connection, or the resync port number for a TCP/IP\r\nconnection.\r\nTo determine the luname or IP address and resync port for downstream participants that can be used with the\r\nFORCE option, look at the location names after the V444 message and in the V450 message in the DISPLAY\r\nTHREAD output (DSNV401). There are two or three tokens associated with the participant location.\r\nv The first token is the partner location name.\r\nv The second token is the partner LU name for an SNA connection, or the IP address for a TCP/IP connection.\r\nThe second token is delimited from the first token by a dash (-).\r\nv The third token is the partner resync port number. The third token appears only if the second token is an IP\r\naddress, and is delimited from the second token by a double period (..).\r\nRemember that the FORCE option causes DB2 to purge all knowledge of indoubt resolution responsibility\r\ninvolving the LUNAME or IPADDR values specified in the command.\r\nUse caution when using the FORCE parameter to purge participant indoubt information when no errors are\r\nprecluding automatic resolution. Normally, after the use of the RECOVER INDOUBT command, automatic\r\nresolution with the coordinator determines if heuristic damage occurred. This detection is lost if RESET\r\nINDOUBT is used before automatic resolution with the coordinator can be achieved.\r\nUse caution when using the FORCE parameter to purge coordinator indoubt information when no errors are\r\nprecluding automatic resolution. Once the information is purged, any participant that is indoubt is forced to use a\r\nheuristic decision process to resolve the indoubt logical unit of work.\r\n2. Examine the -DISPLAY THREAD output.

This number includes DBATs that are actively associated with work for\r\nremote connections and disconnected DBATs.\r\nThis value increases as new DBATs are created or when inactive DBATs become active. This value decreases\r\nas DBATs terminate or become inactive or as disconnected DBATs terminate. When this value reaches or\r\nexceeds the MAXDBAT value, newly attached connections or new work on existing inactive connections or\r\nthreads might be queued. This queueing occurs if no disconnected DBATs are available to service the work.\r\nThe MAXDBAT value is shown in message DSNL090I.\r\nquedbat\r\nThe cumulative number of the following new work items that had to wait for a DBAT to become available:\r\nv Newly attached connections\r\nv New work on inactive connections\r\nv New work on inactive DBATs\r\nThis value is a cumulative counter that is incremented when the MAXDBAT limit is reached. (This value\r\ncorresponds to the QDSTQDBT field in IFCID 1.) The quedbat counter is reset only when this DB2 subsystem\r\nis restarted.\r\nA non-zero value suggests that performance and throughput might be affected. If so, consider increasing the\r\nMAXDBAT value.\r\nThe MAXDBAT value is shown in message DSNL090I.\r\ninadbat The current number of inactive DBATs (which were previously called type 1 inactive threads). This value\r\napplies only if the dt value in message DSNL090I indicates that DDF INACTIVE support is enabled.\r\nFor more information about any DBATs that are included in this number, look at the output from the\r\nDISPLAY THREAD command with the TYPE(INACTIVE) option. The DISPLAY THREAD output begins\r\nwith message DSNV401I.\r\nconqued\r\nThe current number of connection requests that are queued and are waiting to be serviced. This value\r\napplies only if the dt value in message DSNL090I indicates that DDF INACTIVE support is enabled.\r\nThese connections can be newly attached connections or inactive connections for which a new request\r\narrived from the client. The number of inactive connections is shown in message DSNL093I.\r\nThese requests cannot be processed when one of the following conditions occur:\r\nv The maximum number of DBATs is reached, and no disconnected DBATs exist to process the request.\r\nThe maximum number of threads is reached when the adbat value is equal to or greater than MAXDBAT\r\nvalue. (The MAXDBAT value is shown in message DSNL090I.) When this situation occurs, processing\r\ncontinues for these queued connections when another active DBAT releases its slot either by terminating\r\nor by moving to the inactive state.\r\nv DDF is suspended or suspending. See the status value in message DSNL081I. Processing continues when\r\nDDF is started.\r\ndscdbat The current number of disconnected DBATs. This value applies only if the dt value in message DSNL090I\r\nindicates that DDF INACTIVE support is enabled.\r\nThis value indicates the number of DBAT pool threads. DBAT pool threads are the database access threads\r\nthat are available to service queued connections requests. The DBATs that are included in this number are\r\nalso accounted for in the adbat value.\r\nOver time, disconnected DBATs can hold allocation duration locks. An allocation duration lock is a lock that\r\npersists across commit boundaries. This type of lock requires the connection to be deallocated or the thread\r\nto be enabled if it is inactive. You can release these allocation duration locks by terminating these DBATs.\r\nYou can terminate disconnected DBATs by using one of the following methods:\r\nv Issue the STOP DDF command with the MODE(SUSPEND) option. Stopping DDF with\r\nMODE(SUSPEND) terminates these disconnected DBATs without affecting current or new connections.\r\nHowever, activity on these current or new connections is not processed until DDF is started.\r\nv Change the value of the POOLINAC subsystem parameter. This parameter controls the length of time\r\nafter which unused disconnected DBATs are to be automatically terminated.\r\ninaconn\r\nThe current number of inactive connections (which were previously called type 2 connections). This value\r\napplies only if the dt value in message DSNL090I indicates that DDF INACTIVE support is enabled.\r\nThis value represents connections with clients where the client last ended a unit of work either by a commit\r\nor rollback operation. This operation caused DB2 to change the state of the connection to inactive, which\r\nmeans that the DBAT is separated from the connection. The connection becomes inactive while the DBAT is\r\nmade available to service new client connections or to service new requests on existing client connections.\r\nThis value is not included in the inadbat value. When a new request arrives from the client system on the\r\nconnection, the connection is then moved to the conqued value.\r\nFor more information about any connections that are included in this number, look at the output from the\r\nDISPLAY THREAD command with the TYPE(INACTIVE) option.

You can use the\r\nDISPLAY THREAD command to generate a report of indoubt threads. This report indicates all\r\nresynchronization responsibility known by DB2.\r\nIf you do not purge the resynchronization information, or choose to selectively purge, and you want\r\nautomatic resynchronization to occur before changing the names, you must first use the change log\r\ninventory (DSNJU003) utility to change the LUNAME, the LOCATION name, or both back to the correct\r\nvalue.

A protocol error\r\noccurred during the SNA sync point exchange with the participant identified by 'location'. The protocol error fits into\r\none of the following categories:\r\nv An unknown SNA PS header was received.\r\nv An SNA PS header was received in the wrong sequence.\r\nv An invalid LU6.2 verb sequence was used to deliver the SNA PS header.\r\nv A DEALLOCATE TYPE(ABEND_SVC) was received from the participant, indicating that the participant detected a\r\nprotocol violation in the PS headers transmitted by DB2.\r\nlocation\r\nThe relational database name (location-name) of the participant.\r\nluwid=token\r\nThe global logical unit of work id and the local token that identify the thread.\r\nseq-no The IFCID sequence number associated with the trace record. The sequence number is printed in\r\nhexadecimal format. If the sequence number is zero, IFCID 208 was not active or it was active with a\r\ndestination of the resident trace table only.

The DBMS at 'location' performed a cold start. The DB2 participant assumes that the coordinator recovery\r\nlog was lost or damaged and indoubt thread resolution cannot be achieved. There may be inconsistent data at the\r\ncoordinator. A list of indoubt threads involving the coordinator 'location' can be displayed using the DISPLAY\r\nTHREAD command for indoubt type threads by including the LOCATION('location') parameter in the command.\r\nThe heuristic decision (that is, to commit or abort the logical unit of work) should be coordinated with any other\r\nparticipants. The existence of other participants might not be easy to determine. The information might be available\r\nin the coordinators recovery log even though the coordinator performed a cold start. If the coordinator is a DB2, then\r\nit might be possible to execute the DSN1LOGP utility to produce a summary report.

This message should be immediately followed by a DSNB304I message\r\nindicating that the group buffer pool has been entered into damage assessment pending (DAP) state.\r\nIf there are transactions that are in progress at the time of the connectivity failure, DB2 might need to add pages to\r\nthe logical page list (LPL).\r\nThere is one case where DB2 triggers damage assessment for a group buffer pool, but no DSNB314I message is\r\nissued. This case is where the group buffer pool was manually deleted (via MVS SETXCF FORCE commands) while\r\nall connections to the group buffer pool were failed-persistent (e.g. all DB2 members were down). In this case, the\r\nnext DB2 member to connect to the group buffer pool will cause MVS to try to reallocate a new instance of the group\r\nbuffer pool in some coupling facility in the CFRM policy preference list. If the allocation succeeds, then DB2, by\r\ndoing a coupling facility structure version id comparison, will detect that the previous instance of the group buffer\r\npool had been lost, and will trigger damage assessment. But you will not receive the DSNB314I message in this case,\r\nnor will you receive the DSNB304I or DSNB305I messages indicating that the group buffer pool has been put into\r\ndamage assessment pending (DAP) state.

ALLOCATION OR OFFLOAD OF ARCHIVE LOG DATA SET MAY FAIL.\r\nExplanation: While building the SVC99 text entries to dynamically allocate a new archive log data set, a unit\r\nallocation failure was detected. This message is only generated when a trace for IFCID 320 is active. The reason code,\r\nindicated by 'nnnn' in the message, further clarifies the problem as follows:\r\n4 (X'04')\r\nThe device type (unit name) on which the archive log data set is to be allocated is specified by the user in\r\nthe DB2 system parameters. No UCBs could be found for the device type (unit name).\r\n8 (X'08')\r\nThe device type (unit name) on which the archive log data set is to be allocated is specified by the user in\r\nthe DB2 system parameters. This device type (unit name) could not be found in the MVS eligible device\r\ntable (EDT).\r\n32 (X'20')\r\nDB2 was able to obtain a list of devices corresponding to the device type (unit name) specified in ZPARMs.\r\nHowever, it was determined by DB2 that this list contained a mixture of tape and nontape devices.\r\n40 (X'28')\r\nThe device type (unit name) specified by the user in ZPARMs is valid. However, no devices are currently\r\nassociated with the given device type (unit name).\r\n44 (X'2C')\r\nThe device type (unit name) specified by the user in ZPARMs is valid. However, no DASD volumes are\r\navailable with a volume use attribute of 'storage'.\r\n48 (X'30')\r\nThe CVT indicates that UCB services are not available.\r\nSystem action: This message is issued by DB2 after the SVC99 text entries are built, but prior to the allocation of the\r\nnew archive log data set. As a result of the error, the dynamic allocation of the archive log data set will be attempted\r\nusing standard default values. The standard default values are generally acceptable; however, the allocation may fail\r\nor the subsequent offload may produce undesirable processing results. For example:\r\nv A return code of 4 or 44 (X'2C') will foretell an allocation error (DSNJ103I) when the SVC99 is issued for the\r\narchive data set.\r\nv Offload processing to tape may fail. DB2 uses a volume count of 20 when allocating to tape, and uses the standard\r\nMVS volume count default of 5 volumes when writing to nontape devices. In the case of most of the above errors,\r\nit would be impossible for the DB2 subsystem to determine the device type on which the data set is to be\r\nallocated. Therefore, the standard MVS default is assumed for the volume count. If the data set is successfully\r\nallocated to a tape device, and the volume of data is such that more than five volumes will be used for the archive\r\ndata set, the offload processing will receive an MVS ABEND 837-08 with message IEC028I when attempting to\r\nwrite to the sixth tape volume.\r\nv Offload processing to a direct access device may fail. When allocating a new archive log data set on a direct access\r\ndevice, the DB2 subsystem will use a unit count to facilitate multivolume archive data sets. With most of the above\r\nerrors, it may be impossible for the DB2 subsystem to correctly determine the type of device on which the data set\r\nis to be allocated. Therefore, the standard default (1) is assumed for the unit count. If the data set is successfully\r\nallocated to a direct access device, and during the offload processing it becomes necessary to extend the data set to\r\nanother device, the offload processing will receive an MVS B37 (out of space) ABEND, and the archive log data set\r\nwill be deallocated.\r\nOperator response: Notify the system programmer.\r\nSystem programmer response: The required action is based on the return code indicated in the message.\r\n4 (X'04') or 8 (X'08')\r\nThe most likely cause is an incorrect specification in the archive log ZPARMs (DSNTIPA panel). Correct the\r\nDEVICE TYPE field. If the DEVICE TYPE field from the archive log ZPARMs appears to be correct, check\r\nthe EDT to ensure that the esoteric or generic unit name specified in the ZPARMs is actually in the EDT.\r\nSubsequent offload processing will archive the log data which could not be previously archived due to the\r\nallocation failure (DSNJ103I).\r\n32 (X'20') or 40 (X'28')\r\nTo correct this situation, change the archive log DEVICE TYPE ZPARM to use a device type (unit name)\r\nwhich contains homogenous devices, or modify the device list associated with the device type (unit name)\r\nvia a system generation to supply a list of homogenous devices.\r\n44 (X'2C')\r\nTo correct this situation, issue an MVS mount command to change the volume use attribute of a mounted\r\n'private' volume to 'storage'. If this is a recurring problem, a system generation may be required to add\r\npermanently resident volumes with a volume use attribute of 'storage' to the esoteric or generic unit, or\r\nZPARMs may have to be changed to use a different esoteric or generic unit name for the DEVICE TYPE (on\r\nthe DSNTIPA installation panel).\r\n48 (X'30')\r\nUCB services became available in MVS/ESA Version 4.1 (HBB4410).", "DSNU1005I": " csect-name - UTILITY name NOT ALLOWED IN dd-type DD dd-name\r\nExplanation: The utility parser detected a control statement other than TEMPLATE in the SYSTEMPL data set or\r\nLISTDEF in the SYSLISTD data set.\r\nSystem action: Utility processing is not initiated.\r\nUser response: Remove the invalid control statements and resubmit the utility job.\r\nSeverity: 8 (error)\r\nRelated tasks:\r\nReferencing LISTDEF lists in other utility jobs (DB2 Utilities)\r\nRelated reference:\r\nLISTDEF (DB2 Utilities)\r\nTEMPLATE (DB2 Utilities)", "DSNT268I": " csect-name A BIND COMMAND USING THE COPY OPTION NAMED A TRIGGER PACKAGE AS THE SOURCE FOR THE BIND\r\nExplanation: A trigger package cannot be used as the source for a BIND COPY command.\r\nSystem action: The TSO Attachment Facility is ready for more input.\r\nUser response: Correct the BIND command and resubmit.", "DSNJ447I": " KEYWORD required-keyword IS REQUIRED WHEN KEYWORD specified-keyword IS SPECIFIED\r\nExplanation: A change log inventory utility (DSNJU003) control statement specified a keyword that requires an\r\nadditional keyword that was not specified.\r\nrequired-keyword\r\nThe name of the keyword that is required when specified-keyword is used.\r\nspecified-keyword\r\nThe name of the keyword that was specified.

DB2 must\r\nthen determine its IP address. If an IP address is specified in the BSDS using the DSNJU003 utility, or on the\r\nPORT statement in the TCP/IP profile, then DB2 uses this IP address. Otherwise, DB2 executes a\r\nGetAddrInfo(host-name) socket call, using the host-name that was returned on the prior GetHostName socket\r\ncall, which returns the first IP address listed in the name server or local host table.\r\nImportant: The host name or IP address returned could depend on the selected TCP/IP stack, in the event\r\nthat there are multiple TCP/IP stacks. DB2 requires z/OS UNIX System Services sockets, and it is z/OS\r\nUNIX System Services that determines the TCP/IP stack to use. z/OS UNIX System Services provides a way\r\nfor users to select a specific TCP/IP stack by using the BPXTCAFF utility.\r\nDB2 then issues a GetNameInfo socket call to determine the domain name associated with the derived IP\r\naddress.\r\nThe z/OS Resolver handles the GetNameInfo socket call because DB2 uses the z/OS UNIX System Services\r\nAsynchronous Sockets interface. This resolver uses the resolver configuration information available to DDF.\r\nUntil this information for the selected TCP/IP is correctly specified for DDF, the z/OS Resolver will be\r\nunable to determine the domain name for DDF. You can find the search order for the \u201cresolver configuration\r\nfiles\u201d for a z/OS application, such as DDF, in the IP Configuration manual for the appropriate level of the\r\nCommunication Server for your z/OS operating system.\r\nsocket=GETHOSTNAME\r\nDB2 DDF initialization invoked a TCP/IP GetHostName socket call in order to determine the host\r\nname associated to TCP/IP, and hence the host name associated with the DB2 subsystem. However,\r\nthe call failed and DB2 is not able to determine the host name. DB2 retries the socket call\r\nperiodically.\r\nsocket=GETNAMEINFO(ip-address)\r\nDB2 invoked a TCP/IP GetNameInfo socket call to determine the domain name for the specified IP\r\naddress. However, the call failed and DB2 is not able to determine the domain name. DB2 retries\r\nthe socket call periodically.\r\nsocket=GETADDRINFO(host-name)\r\nDB2 invoked a TCP/IP GetAddrInfo socket call to determine the IP address associated with the\r\nspecified host name. However, the call failed and DB2 is not able to determine the IP address. DB2\r\nretries the socket call periodically.\r\nIf you want a BSDS-specified IP address, correct the BSDS. This requires you to stop and restart\r\nDB2. Otherwise, verify that the provided host name is correct and take the appropriate action:\r\nv If the host name is incorrect, correct the host name in the appropriate resolver configuration file,\r\nrefresh TCP/IP, and then stop and start DDF so that the new host name is refreshed for DDF\r\ninitialization.\r\nv If the host name is correct, then TCP/IP is unable to resolve the host name to an IP address. You\r\nmust make changes in order to allow for proper host name to IP address resolution. If the\r\nchanges have been made to the name server or local host table, refresh the resolver.\r\nsocket=POLL\r\nThe online ZPARM was changed using the SET SYSPARM command, changing the MAXDBAT from a\r\npositive value to zero. In this case, the message is informational, indicating that DB2 terminated its TCP/IP\r\nlistening capability for SQL related work because DB2 can no longer accept SQL related connections from\r\nremote partners when MAXDBAT is set to zero.\r\nsocket=SHUTDOWN_REG (USS_UNAVAILABLE)\r\nThe z/OS UNIX System Services (USS/OMVS) environment is not available. DDF start processing continues\r\nand this message is periodically repeated until the Unix System Services environment becomes available or\r\nDDF is stopped.

For instructions on how to enable DDF as a superuser, see the\r\ninformation about enabling DDF for UNIX System Services.\r\nsocket=TCPKEEPALIVE\r\nDB2 issues this socket call as a result of the TCP/IP KeepAlive value specified in the DB2 parameters\r\nmodule (usually DSNZPARM). You may specify this value by the TCP/IP KEEPALIVE value in the\r\nDSNTIP5 installation panel. Another way to specify the value is through the TCPKPALV value in the\r\nDSN6FAC macro, used to build the DB2 parameters module.\r\nIn this situation, processing continues, and DB2 does not retry the socket call. Verify that the TCP/IP stack\r\nbeing used by DB2 contains the required companion support for this function. If not, modify the DB2\r\nparameter module to prevent DB2 from attempting to override the TCP/IP stack value.\r\nsocket=BSDS_ERROR (ADDRESS_ON_PORT_STMT)\r\nAn IP address is specified in both the BSDS and the PORT statement of the TCP/ IP profile. An address\r\nshould be specified in only one place. That is, DB2 detected that IP addresses have been specified in the\r\nBSDS (through the IPV4, GRPIPV4, IPV6, and GRPIPV6 keywords of the DSNJU003 Change Log Inventory\r\nutility) and also in the TCP/IP profile on the PORT statement for the port value to be used by this\r\nsubsystem. Only one of the specifications can now have IP addresses. The DB2 TCP/IP environment will not\r\ninitialize, and the error is periodically repeated until the error is corrected.\r\nOne of the IP address specifications must be removed from the BSDS or from the TCP/IP profile. However,\r\nthe BSDS specification should be retained because the recommendation is to use BSDS specifications to\r\ndefine the IP addresses that are to be associated to DB2, and, because removing the BSDS specifications\r\nwould require DB2 to be stopped. In this case, to allow the initialization of the DB2 TCP/IP environment to\r\ncontinue. The TCP/IP profile PORT statement can be changed to remove the IP addresses and then the\r\nchanged specifications can be dynamically brought on-line, which favors the BSDS specifications.\r\nsocket=BSDS_ERROR (IPv6_REQUIRES_DUALMODE_STACK)\r\nA member or subsystem, or possibly a group, IPv6 address is specified in the BSDS without TCP/IP dual\r\nmode stack enabled. DB2 ignores all IPv6 addresses defined in the BSDS and DDF start-processing continues\r\nnormally.\r\nYou should either enable a dual mode stack or delete all of the BSDS-defined IPv6 addresses and use only\r\nIPv4 addresses.\r\nsocket=BINDSPECIFIC NOT SUPPORT WITH SECURE PORT\r\nA secure port was specified in the BSDS but an IP address is simultaneously defined on the PORT statement\r\nin the TCP/IP profile (PROFILE.TCPIP).\r\nDDF supports secure ports only when it is listening on the INADDR_ANY.\r\nsocket=DVIPA ACTIVATION(ip-address)\r\nThe specified IP address cannot be activated as a VIPARANGE DVIPA. DB2 does not know whether the\r\nspecified IP address was intended to be used as a DVIPA. If it was intended to be used as a DVIPA, correct\r\nthe error and recycle DDF to activate it. However, if the IP address was not intended to be used as a DVIPA,\r\nignore this message.\r\nsocket=EZBNMIF4_DROPCON\r\nDB2 invoked the TCP/IP EZBNMIF4 (EZBNMIFR) service to drop a connection. The call failed but DB2\r\nprocessing continues. DB2 periodically issues the message until the error is corrected. Refer to Using the\r\nEZBNMIFR requests (z/OS Communications Server: IP Programmer's Guide and Reference) for an\r\nexplanation of the return and reason code values.\r\nThe most common cause for the failure is a return code value of 111 (EACCES) and a reason code value of\r\n77E800DC (JRSAFNotAuthorized). This return and reason code indicates that TCP/IP determined that RACF\r\nsecurity profiles were not defined to permit DB2 to use the service.
