The activation of some of\r\nthe triggers in this chain might be due to the enforcement of referential constraint delete rules.

The exception error occurred in one of the following areas:\r\nv In the SELECT list of an SQL SELECT statement.\r\nv In the search condition of a SELECT, UPDATE, MERGE, or DELETE statement.\r\nv In the SET clause of the UPDATE operation.\r\nv During the evaluation of an aggregate function.\r\nParts of exception-type, operation-type, data-type, and position-number might not be returned to the SQL communication\r\narea, depending on where the error was detected.\r\nexception-type\r\nIndicates the type of error.\r\nPossible values for exception-type are:\r\nv FIXED POINT OVERFLOW\r\nv DECIMAL OVERFLOW\r\nv ZERO DIVIDE\r\nv DIVIDE EXCEPTION\r\nv EXPONENT OVERFLOW\r\nv INVALID OPERATION\r\nv SUBNORMAL\r\nv UNDERFLOW\r\nv OVERFLOW\r\nv OUT OF RANGE\r\noperation-type\r\nIndicates the operation that was being performed at the time of the error.

In the case of an insert or update operation, no data is updated\r\nor deleted. If the statement was a cursor-controlled FETCH, the cursor will remain open unless the exception\r\noccurred while processing an aggregate function (indicated by operation-type of AGGREGATE FUNCTION), in which\r\ncase the cursor will be closed. If the cursor is closed, subsequent attempts to use that cursor without first doing an\r\nOPEN for it receive an SQLCODE -501. If the statement was a cursor-controlled OPEN, the cursor will remain closed.\r\nProgrammer response: Examine the SQL statement to see if the cause of the problem can be determined. The\r\nproblem might be data-dependent, in which case it will be necessary to examine the data that was being processed at\r\nthe time the error occurred.\r\nIf the arithmetic expression in error was within the SELECT list of the outer SELECT statement, it is advisable to\r\ninclude an indicator variable for all expressions in the SELECT list. This allows processing to continue so that\r\nnon-error column and expression values can be returned.\r\nSee the explanation of SQLCODE -405 for allowed ranges of numeric data types.\r\nProblem determination: A fixed point overflow can occur during any arithmetic operation on BIGINT, INTEGER, or\r\nSMALLINT fields.\r\nA divide exception can occur on a decimal division operation when the quotient exceeds the specified data field size.\r\nA zero divide occurs on a division by zero.\r\nAn exponent overflow can occur when the result characteristic of any floating-point operation exceeds 127 and the\r\nresult fraction is not zero, for example, the magnitude of the result exceeds approximately 7.2E+75.\r\nA decimal overflow exception can occur under either of the following circumstances:\r\nv One or more non-zero digits are lost because the destination field in any decimal operation is too short to contain\r\nthe result.\r\nv A Java stored procedure or user-defined function sets a decimal value in an output parameter that has a precision\r\nor scale too small for the value. operation-type is Java conversion. data-type is DECIMAL. position-number indicates\r\nwhich parameter of the CALL statement or user-defined function invocation is in error.\r\nAny of the exception or overflow conditions can occur during the processing of a built-in function. If the\r\noperation-type is FUNCTION, the error occurred while processing either an input, intermediate, or final value.

It is possible that one or more rows of data were\r\nreturned. In cases where the row information returned for the row that encountered the condition is incomplete, use\r\nof the data for the row that encountered the condition, such as displaying or printing the data, is not recommended.\r\nSystem action: DB2 processed the statement successfully, but with at least one non-terminating error. Additionally,\r\nthe fetching of some rows might have encountered warnings.\r\nProgrammer response: Analyze the conditions to determine whether follow-up actions are needed. The GET\r\nDIAGNOSTICS statement can be used to determine which additional actions might be necessary.\r\nAttention: It is possible that an end of data condition was detected. SQLERRD3 and GET DIAGNOSTICS can be\r\nused to determine if all the requested rows were fetched or if a partial rowset was returned.\r\nSQLSTATE: 22537", "-353": "FETCH IS NOT ALLOWED, BECAUSE CURSOR cursor-name HAS AN UNKNOWN POSITION\r\nExplanation: The cursor position for cursor-name is unknown. The previous multiple-row-fetch for cursor cursor-name\r\nresulted in an error in the middle of processing multiple rows that were retrieved from DB2. One or more of the\r\nrequested rows could not be returned to the program following the error, leaving the position of the cursor unknown.\r\nThe error might have been detected at the requester. For example, a row with a null value was returned to an\r\napplication, but no indicator variable was provided. A subsequent FETCH statement would result in SQLCODE -353.\r\nIf an indicator had been provided, a positive SQLCODE would have been returned and all of the rows retrieved from\r\nDB2 could have been returned to the application program.\r\nSystem action: The statement cannot be processed. The cursor position is not changed.\r\nProgrammer response: Close and reopen the cursor to reset the cursor position. For scrollable cursors, you can\r\nchange the FETCH statement to specify one of the other fetch orientations. For example, you can modify the FETCH\r\nstatement by specifying one of the following fetch orientations:\r\nv BEFORE or AFTER\r\nv row-positioned fetch orientations: FIRST, LAST, or ABSOLUTE to establish a valid row cursor and fetch a row of\r\ndata\r\nv rowset-positioned fetch orientations: FIRST ROWSET, LAST ROWSET, or ROWSET STARTING AT ABSOLUTE to\r\nestablish a valid rowset cursor position and fetch multiple rows of data\r\nAlternately, change the application to correct the error that originally occurred. For example, if the error was issued\r\nbecause an indicator was not provided, change the application to provide an indicator.\r\nSQLSTATE: 24513", "-352": "AN UNSUPPORTED SQLTYPE WAS ENCOUNTERED IN POSITION position-number OF THE INPUT-LIST\r\nExplanation: The input SQLDA for an OPEN, EXECUTE, FETCH, or CALL statement contains an unsupported\r\nSQLTYPE for a parameter.\r\nposition-number\r\nThe position of the first element in the SQLDA with an unsupported data type.\r\nEither the application requestor or the application server does not have support for this data type.

This error might also occur if the object is a read-only view (for insert, delete,\r\nor update data change operation), or if auth-id is trying to create a table or view with an authorization ID other than\r\nits own.\r\nYou can create a table from an auth-id other than your own only if your authorization ID is SYSADM, DBADM, or\r\nDBCTRL. You can create a view from an auth-id other than your own only if your authorization ID is SYSADM.\r\nIf you are using a trusted context, the token auth-id might return a role instead of an authorization ID. A role is\r\nreturned if a role was in effect and the authorization checking is performed against the role, rather than the\r\nauthorization ID of the session, when the condition was encountered. Otherwise an authorization ID is returned. A\r\nrole is returned in the following format as a single token:\r\nv ROLE: role-name\r\nIf you use the RACF access control module for authorization checking, auth-id might be different from the value\r\nthat is reported in message ICH408I. The ID that is reported in message ICH408I is the user ID that RACF used to\r\ncheck the privilege.\r\nIn addition to the situations mentioned previously, this error can occur for the following situations:\r\nv When operation is GRANT ***, the keyword ALL was used in the GRANT statement, but the grantor auth-id does\r\nnot have any privilege to grant.\r\nv If operation is DROP PACKAGE, the object-name consists of the collection ID, the package name, and the consistency\r\ntoken. The consistency token uniquely identifies the version of the package that the user does not have\r\nauthorization to drop.\r\nv If operation is USAGE OF DISTINCT TYPE or USAGE OF JAR, the object-name identifies, respectively, the\r\nDISTINCT TYPE or JAR for which the auth-id lacks USAGE privilege.\r\nv If operation is ALTER JAR, the auth-id lacks ALTERIN privilege on the schema of the JAR object-name.\r\nv If this error occurs while DB2 is creating or altering a table that involves referential constraints, this error message\r\nreports that the user does not have the necessary ALTER privilege to perform a FOREIGN KEY, DROP FOREIGN\r\nKEY, DROP PRIMARY KEY, or DROP UNIQUE operation. The object-name identifies the object table of the\r\nCREATE or ALTER TABLE statement, not the table for which the user lacks the ALTER privilege.\r\nv If this error occurs for a distributed SQL request, one of the following conditions can occur:\r\n\u2013 If authorization ID translation is in effect for either the requesting DB2 site or the serving (responding) DB2 site,\r\nthen auth-id is the translated authorization ID. Refer to Part 3 (Volume 1) of the DB2 Administration Guide for\r\ninformation on authorization ID translation.\r\n\u2013 If an alias name was used in the SQL statement, the object-name is the resolved remote table name or view name.\r\nv If this error occurs during invocation of a routine, the authorization ID auth-id does not have the EXECUTE\r\nprivilege on any candidate routine in the SQL path. The variable for object-name is the name of a candidate routine\r\nin the SQL path.\r\nv An object does not exist, and the CURRENT RULES special register is set to STD.\r\nv If the access control authorization exit routine is active and the authorization ID of the process does not have the\r\nnecessary privileges, this error might occur for packages that are bound with the DYNAMICRULES(BIND) option\r\nwhen authorization caching, statement caching, or both are enabled.\r\nSystem action: The statement cannot be processed.\r\nProgrammer response: To correct the error, verify the following situations:\r\nv The auth-id has the authority to perform the operation.\r\nv The object-name exists.\r\nv The auth-id is not trying to create a table with a schema qualifier that is not the same as auth-id.\r\nSQLSTATE: 42501", "00D70024": "Explanation: No data sets exist for a nonpartitioned table space or index space.

Rather than return one block of\r\nquery data, the DRDA server system elected to return multiple extra blocks. Instead of fetching all rows in all the\r\nextra blocks, the requesting application either executed an SQL statement that is not related to the query or executed\r\na commit while a held cursor was still open. DB2 buffers the extra in-transit blocks, however DB2 was not able to\r\nbuffer the entire set of extra blocks and thus truncated the result set. The application then resumed fetching and\r\nattempted to fetch data beyond the point of truncation.\r\nThis SQLCODE can also be returned when the DRDA server system calculates the maximum amount of storage\r\nrequired for processing query data, and finds the requested storage exceeds the system limit.\r\nSystem action: The SQL statement fails.\r\nOperator response: Notify the system programmer.\r\nSystem programmer response: Determine the failing application program and consider the following resolutions:\r\nv The cursor definition may cause the server to return extra blocks. In this case, the cursor definition can be changed\r\nto reduce the number of rows, thus extra blocks, being returned by the server.\r\nDB2 for z/OS systems return extra blocks for cursors defined with the OPTIMIZER FOR n rows clause and will\r\nreturn only enough extra blocks in order to return n rows. When a cursor is defined with OPTIMIZER FOR n\r\nrows, either in the application or in a stored procedure, this indicates an application intent to fetch all n rows\r\nbefore attempting to execute other SQL statements. The application is not abiding by its intent and is executing\r\nother SQL, or committing, prior to fetching all n rows. In this case, the cursor definition can be changed to reduce\r\nthe value of n, or the application logic can be modified to fetch all n rows or to close the cursor before executing\r\nthe statement that caused the in-transit data to be buffered.\r\nv The number of extra blocks returned can be controlled by DB2 installation parameters. The maximum number of\r\nextra blocks requested by a DB2 requester system is determined by the \"Extra Blocks Req\" option of the DSNTIP5\r\nDB2 installation panel. This value can be reduced which prevents the server system from returning more blocks\r\nthan the DB2 requester system can buffer.\r\nSimilarly, the server system may also provide a method to regulate the maximum number of extra blocks that it\r\nwill return to a requester. In this case, this number can also be reduced. For DB2 for z/OS systems, this is\r\ndetermined by the EXTRA BLOCKS SRV field on the DSNTIP5 DB2 installation panel.\r\nExamine the columns in the cursor select list. The columns in the select list can impact the amount of storage\r\nrequired by the DRDA server for processing query data. The cursor definition can be changed to reduce the\r\nnumber of columns in the select list, or the columns in the select list can be changed to have a smaller declared\r\nlength in the table. Both can reduce the required storage at the DRDA server to handle the query data.\r\nFor information about block fetching result sets, see DB2 Performance Monitoring and Tuning Guide.\r\nUser response: Notify the system programmer.\r\nProblem determination: Collect the following diagnostic items:\r\nv Listing of the results produced by the SQL statements.\r\nv Source listing of the failing application program.", "00E3009E": "Explanation: The plan depends on new facilities of the release from which fall back has occurred.\r\nSystem action: The allocation for the user failed.\r\nSystem programmer response: Warn the user community NOT to run this plan until you have remigrated to the\r\nnewer release.\r\nUser response: Do not use this plan until your DB2 subsystem is remigrated to the newer release.", "00D10350": "Explanation: A lock or unlock failed in an attempt to allocate an archive log tape.\r\nSystem action: An execution unit writes a record to SYS1.LOGREC, requests an SVC dump, and then terminates.\r\nOperator response: Collect all relevant diagnostic materials, including SYS1.LOGREC, an SVC dump, and console\r\noutput.

The\r\nproblem could be with the data type or some other attributes of a parameter. For some data types there are attributes\r\nin addition to data type:\r\nv Length, precision, or scale\r\nWhile it is not necessary to specify a length, precision, or scale attribute for a data type, if one is specified then\r\nthere must be an exact match on the corresponding specification of the parameter for the existing function as\r\ndefined in SYSPARMS.\r\nA type of FLOAT(n) does not need to match the defined value for n since 1<=n<=21 means REAL and 22<=n<=53\r\nmeans DOUBLE. Matching occurs based on whether the type is REAL or DOUBLE.\r\nHowever, a match on data type is sufficient.\r\nTo indicate this, an empty set of parentheses must be specified for the data types that allow a specification of\r\nlength, precision, or scale. For example, assuming a function exists for which a parameter was defined as\r\nCHAR(12) on the CREATE FUNCTION statement, a reference to that function by a signature could specify this\r\nparameter as either CHAR(12), or CHAR(). The CHAR() syntax provides a way to say, \"do not care about length,\r\nprecision and scale attributes in finding a matching function\".\r\nFLOAT() cannot be used since the parameter value indicates different data types (REAL or DOUBLE).\r\nIf, however, neither length, precision, scale, or empty parenthesis were specified, then normal default rules apply.\r\nFor example, a specification of CHAR would result in CHAR(1) as on the CREATE TABLE statement. Furthermore,\r\nthis implicit specification of length, precision, or scale must exactly match the corresponding specification of the\r\nparameter for the existing function as defined in SYSPARMS.\r\nv Subtype, or encoding scheme\r\nYou do not need to specify the subtype or encoding scheme (CCSID clause) to identify an existing function in the\r\ndatabase. However, if a subtype or encoding scheme is specified then there must be an exact match on the\r\ncorresponding specification of the parameter for the existing function as defined in SYSPARMS.\r\nUnqualified function names:\r\nv For ALTER FUNCTION, DROP FUNCTION, COMMENT ON FUNCTION, GRANT and REVOKE statements for\r\nEXECUTE on functions, an unqualified function name is implicitly qualified with the default schema, and this is\r\nthe schema where the function with the problem can be found.\r\nv In the SOURCE clause of a CREATE FUNCTION statement, the qualification comes from the SQL path. In this\r\ncase, the is no matching function in the entire path.\r\nAttention: A function cannot be sourced on the COALESCE, NULLIF, RAISE_ERROR, RID, or VALUE built-in\r\nfunctions.

THE STATEMENT HAS FAILED. REASON reason-code\r\nExplanation: A reason code is issued during the processing of a CREATE INDEX or ALTER INDEX statement.\r\nWhen the statement fails, the reason for the failure is indicated by the following reason code value:\r\n 0001 You specified a buffer pool with a page size other then 4KB in the CREATE or ALTER INDEX statement.\r\n 0002 An ALTER INDEX or CREATE INDEX statement results in an invalid combination of a 4KB page size and\r\nCOMPRESS YES. This reason-code will be issued for the following reasons:\r\nv If you tried to CREATE or ALTER an index, you did not specify a buffer pool having a page size that is\r\nsupported for index compression. You can only choose a buffer pool with an 8KB, 16KB, or 32KB page\r\nsize for a compressed index.\r\nv If you tried to ALTER an index using ALTER INDEX with the COMPRESS YES clause, then the existing\r\nindex is not defined with a buffer pool that has an 8KB, 16KB, or 32KB page size, and therefore, the index\r\ncannot be compressed.\r\n 0003 The ALTER INDEX statement has resulted in an index that's on-disk page size in incompatible with the CISIZE of the index's underlying non-DB2 managed data set. This reason-code will be issued for the following reasons:\r\nv If the index is not compressed, a 4 KB page size must reside in a data set that has a 4 KB CISIZE. A page\r\nsize greater than 4KB must have a CISIZE that is either 4KB or equal to the page size.\r\nv If the index is compressed, then the index pages on disk are always 4 KB. The CISIZE for the data set\r\nmust also be 4KB.\r\nSystem action: The statement cannot be processed.\r\nProgrammer response: Depending on the reason code value, take the following action:\r\n 0001 Change the buffer pool specification to the name of a buffer pool with a 4KB page size.\r\n 0002 Modify the statement so that is does not result in a compressed index with a 4 KB page size.\r\n 0003 ALTER the STOGROUP to use a DB2 managed data set or change the CISIZE of the user-managed data set to be compatible with the specified index options. If the index is compressed, the CISIZE must be 4KB.\r\nOtherwise, the CISIZE should match the page size or be 4KB.\r\nSQLSTATE: 53041\r\nRelated reference:\r\nALTER INDEX (DB2 SQL)\r\nCREATE INDEX (DB2 SQL)", "-677": "INSUFFICIENT VIRTUAL STORAGE FOR BUFFERPOOL EXPANSION\r\nExplanation: An attempt to either open (create) or expand a buffer pool has failed because insufficient virtual\r\nstorage was available.\r\nThis error may occur under either of two circumstances:\r\nv An attempt to create a buffer pool while opening a table space or index(space), or\r\nv An attempt to expand a buffer pool from its current size to its maximum size.\r\nSystem action: The statement cannot be processed.\r\nProgrammer response: If this error should occur during interactive execution of an SQL statement or execution of\r\nan application program, installation administration should be notified.\r\nInstallation Action: It may be necessary to reexamine the buffer pool storage strategy.\r\nOne of the following messages has also been sent to the MVS console: DSNB601I, DSNB603I, or DSNB605I.\r\nSQLSTATE: 57011\r\nRelated tasks:\r\nControlling buffer storage (DB2 Installation and Migration)\r\nRelated information:\r\nDSNB601I (DB2 Messages)\r\nDSNB603I (DB2 Messages)\r\nDSNB605I (DB2 Messages)", "00E40310": "Explanation: An error occurred during the restart of a LOAD or REORG utility execution.
