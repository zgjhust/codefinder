A possible loop has been\r\ndetected in module modname at offset X'offset'. This is\r\nthe offset of the instruction which was executing at the\r\ntime the error was detected.\r\nSystem action: An exception entry is made in the\r\ntrace table. A system dump is taken, unless you have\r\nspecifically suppressed dumps in the dump table.\r\nCICS continues unless you have specified in the dump\r\ntable that CICS should terminate. If appropriate, an\r\nerror return code is sent to the caller of this domain. In\r\nthis case CICS could be terminated by the caller (for\r\nexample, the domain manager, DFHDMDM). A\r\nmessage is issued to this effect.\r\nMessage DFHME0116, which contains the symptom\r\nstring for this problem, is produced.\r\nUser response: Notify the system programmer. If\r\nCICS has not been terminated, it is necessary to decide\r\nwhether the problem is serious enough to bring CICS\r\ndown.\r\nSince some CICS functions can use a lot of processor\r\ntime, this message may have been caused by a\r\nlong-running function. So there may not be an error\r\nhere. Usually, CICS purges a CICS function which\r\nexceeds the runaway task time interval which you have\r\nspecified in the SIT (this is the ICVR which is measured\r\nin milliseconds). This means that module modname in\r\nthe message is terminated and CICS continues.\r\nBut if you have declared ICVR=0 in the SIT and you\r\nconsider that module modname has gone into a loop,\r\nyou have to terminate CICS in order to terminate the\r\nrunaway function.\r\nIf CICS has terminated module modname, and you\r\nconsider that it was not a runaway, you should increase\r\nthe ICVR time interval in the SIT. You have to bring\r\nCICS down at a suitable time to do this permanently.\r\nBut you can change the ICVR time interval temporarily\r\nonline, using the CEMT transaction.\r\nIf raising the ICVR time does not solve the problem,\r\nyou will need further assistance from IBM.

The TCP/IP host name genericname will become available for DNS connection optimization.\r\nExplanation: The group name has been registered\r\nwith Workload Manager for Domain Name Service\r\n(DNS) connection optimization. This occurs when a\r\nTCPIPSERVICE is opened where its name begins with\r\nthe character 'D'. The new generic TCP/IP host name\r\nbecomes available for clients to use to access the CICS\r\nsystem, and any others that have registered with the\r\nnamed group name.\r\nSystem action: CICS has issued the Workload\r\nManager macro IWMSRSRG to register the specified\r\ngroup name for DNS connection optimization. This\r\nonly occurs when the name of the TCPIPSERVICE\r\nbegins with a 'D'. Workload manager registration only\r\noccurs once for a given group name. If multiple\r\nTCPIPSERVICES define the same group name, then\r\nregistration will only occur once.\r\nThe group name registered is taken from a combination\r\nof part of the name of the TCPIPSERVICE and the\r\ntransaction defined for the TCPIPSERVICE. Any\r\ncharacters of the name following a dot '.' are\r\nconcatenated with the transaction identifier to form the\r\ngroup name. For example, a TCPIPSERVICE has the\r\nname D1.CICS and is defined with the transaction IIOP\r\n(the IIOP transaction being an alias of the\r\nCICS-supplied CIRR transaction). The group name\r\ngenerated is 'CICSIIOP'. If the TCPIPSERVICE name\r\ndoes not contain a dot, then only the transaction\r\nidentifier is used. For example, a TCPIPSERVICE with\r\na name of 'DYNWEB' and a transaction of WWW will\r\ngenerate a registration for the group 'WWW'.\r\nThe group name registered effectively becomes a new\r\nname in the sysplex TCP/IP domain. When multiple\r\nCICS systems in a sysplex each register with the same\r\ngroup name, the DNS server uses Workload Manager\r\nto resolve the group name into one of the IP addresses\r\nof the associated systems. The IP address returned is\r\nthat of the system that is most eligible according to\r\nWorkload Manager's load balancing rules. For example,\r\ntwo OS/390 systems in a sysplex are\r\nmvs1.plex.hursley.ibm.com and\r\nmvs2.plex.hursley.ibm.com; and on each system, CICS\r\nregisters with the group name cicsiiop. The new name\r\ncicsiiop.plex.hursley.ibm.com is dynamically added to\r\nthe DNS name server's tables.

If an MVS code is not applicable, this field is\r\nfilled with three hyphens. The 4-digit code bbbb, which\r\nfollows aaa, is a user abend code produced either by\r\nCICS or by another product on the user's system.\r\nIf X'offset' contains the value X'FFFF', then module\r\nmodname was in control at the time of the abend, but\r\nthe program status word (PSW) was not addressing\r\nthis module.\r\nSystem action: An exception entry is made in the\r\ntrace table. A system dump is taken, unless you have\r\nspecifically suppressed dumps in the dump table.\r\nEither this is a critical error and CICS is terminated,\r\neven if you have specified in the dump table that CICS\r\nshould not terminate.\r\nOr CICS will continue unless you have specified in the\r\ndump table that CICS should terminate. Message DFHME0116, which contains the symptom string for\r\nthis problem, is produced.\r\nUser response: Notify the system programmer.\r\nLook up the MVS code aaa, if there is one, in the\r\nrelevant MVS codes manual which is detailed in the\r\nbook list in the front of this manual.\r\nIf the modname insert contains the value ????, then\r\nCICS was unable to determine which module has\r\nabnormally terminated. In this case, examine the\r\nsystem dump to determine which area of code has\r\ncaused the program check.\r\nThe user should examine other messages to determine\r\nwhat the module which issued this message was doing\r\nat the time the abend occurred. From these messages\r\nthey can deduce which product has produced the\r\nabend code bbbb. If bbbb is identified as a CICS code, it\r\nmay be either alphameric or numeric.\r\nv\r\nIf the CICS code is alphameric (for example AKEA)\r\nthen it is a CICS transaction abend code.\r\nv\r\nIf the CICS code is numeric (for example 1310), it\r\nrefers to a CICS message (DFHTS1310 in our\r\nexample).\r\nIf the user abend code is from another product (for\r\nexample, IMS), refer to the appropriate messages and\r\ncodes manual to determine the cause of the abend.\r\nThe entries in the appropriate manuals will give the\r\nuser guidance regarding the nature of the error, and\r\nmay also give some guidance concerning the\r\nappropriate user response.\r\nNote: The program check may have occurred in a user\r\nprogram. If this is the case, the program check is\r\nusually followed by an ASRA or an ASRB transaction\r\nabend and a transaction dump.\r\nIf you want to suppress system dumps that precede\r\nASRA and ASRB abends, you must specify this on an\r\nentry in the dump table, using either CEMT or an\r\nEXEC CICS command.

CICS has diagnosed the cause\r\nof the 0C4 as an attempt to either access or overwrite\r\nstorage in DSA dsaname. The DSA is one of CDSA,\r\nRDSA, UDSA, ECDSA, ERDSA, ETDSA, EUDSA or\r\nGCDSA for overwrite, or either UDSA or EUDSA for\r\naccess.\r\nIf dsaname is CDSA, ECDSA, ETDSA or GCDSA:\r\nCICS is running with storage protection active.\r\nThe CDSA, ECDSA, ETDSA and GCDSA\r\ntherefore contain CICS key storage. They are\r\nwrite protected from user programs executing\r\nin User key. The most likely causes of the 0C4\r\nare:\r\nv\r\nA program executing in CICS key passed\r\nthe address of CICS key storage in the\r\nCDSA, ECDSA, ETDSA or GCDSA to a user\r\nprogram executing in User key and this user\r\nprogram attempted to write to this storage.\r\nv\r\nA user program executing in User key\r\ncontains an error and accidentally attempted\r\nto write to CICS key storage in the CDSA,\r\nECDSA, ETDSA or GCDSA.\r\nv\r\nA user program executing in User key\r\ndeliberately attempted to write to CICS key\r\nstorage in the CDSA, ECDSA, ETDSA or\r\nGCDSA.\r\nIf dsaname is ERDSA or RDSA:\r\nCICS may be running with or without storage\r\nprotection active. The ERDSA or RDSA\r\ncontains only reentrant CICS and user\r\nprograms. If RENTPGM=PROTECT was\r\nspecified as a system initialization parameter,\r\nthe ERDSA or RDSA is write protected from\r\nprograms executing in both CICS key and\r\nUser key. If RENTPGM=NOPROTECT, the\r\nERDSA or RDSA is only protected from user\r\nprograms executing in User key. The most\r\nlikely causes of the 0C4 are:\r\nv\r\nA user program residing in the ERDSA or\r\nRDSA has attempted to modify its own\r\nstorage, (that is, the program is not\r\nreentrant).\r\nv\r\nA user program contains an error and\r\naccidentally attempted to overwrite program\r\nstorage in the ERDSA or RDSA.\r\nIf dsaname is EUDSA or UDSA:\r\nCICS is running with both storage protection\r\nand transaction isolation active. The EUDSA\r\nand UDSA contain only USER key non-shared\r\nstorage. The most likely causes of the 0C4 are:\r\nv\r\nIf the action is overwrite, a program has\r\nattempted to modify the non-shared storage\r\nbelonging to another transaction.\r\nv\r\nIf the action is access, a program has\r\nattempted to either read storage or execute\r\nan instruction within another transaction's\r\nnon-shared storage.\r\nSystem action: Either, the transaction abends with\r\nabend code ASRA. This message is followed by\r\nmessage DFHAP0001 or DFHSR0001 which gives the\r\nname of the program in error and the offset into that\r\nprogram at which the error occurred. Additionally, an\r\nexception trace entry is taken which gives program,\r\noffset, execution key and the DSA in question.\r\nOr, this is a critical error and CICS is terminated. This\r\nmessage is followed by a DFHSR06xx message giving\r\nthe reason for the termination.\r\nUser response: Depending on the cause and dsaname,\r\ndo one of the following:\r\nv\r\nCorrect any error in the program.\r\nv\r\nRedefine transactions with ISOLATE(NO) where they\r\nhave to share storage.\r\nv\r\nChange the program resource definition so that it\r\nexecutes in CICS key (and the basespace).\r\nv\r\nEnsure that the program is not loaded into the\r\nERDSA by not link-editing it with the RENT option.\r\nModule: DFHSRP\r\nMessage inserts:\r\n1. applid\r\n2.

DFHWS2LS cannot process this operation.\r\nThe wire signature is used to determine the operation\r\nthat is being invoked based on the sequence of XML\r\nchild elements found within the SOAP:body element at\r\nruntime.

For\r\nexample, you could change the problematic XML\r\nconstruct for a different one that is supported. For\r\nexample, the xsd:any construct is supported by both\r\nDFHWS2LS and DFHSC2LS and can be used as a\r\nreplacement for most other constructs at mapping level\r\n2.1 onwards. A change of this type can usually be made\r\nwithout breaking interoperability with partner\r\nprocesses that are implemented using the original XML\r\nschema or WSDL document. If changing or simplifying\r\nthe XML schema or WSDL is not acceptable then other\r\noptions exist:\r\nv If you are using DFHWS2LS, then at runtime level\r\n2.1 onwards you can use the XML-ONLY parameter\r\nto opt-out of the CICS supplied XML transformation\r\nservice. This results in a WSBind file being generated\r\nthat tells CICS that the application will work directly\r\nwith the SOAP Body in the DFHWS-BODY container.\r\nv If you are implementing a Web service provider\r\napplication then you could consider writing your\r\nown XML capable SOAP application handler.\r\nv If you are implementing a Web service requester\r\napplication then you could consider writing an XML\r\ncapable application that uses the DFHPIRT channel\r\nlinkable SOAP interface.\r\nOther products may exist that can help process or omit\r\nthe problematic XML constructs.

CICS needs the wire\r\nsignatures to be different in order to determine which\r\noperation is being invoked.\r\nThe wire signature is determined by the immediate\r\nchild elements of the SOAP body tag. If RPC style\r\nSOAP messages are used then the name of the WSDL\r\nOperation is included in the SOAP message and CICS\r\ncan therefore determine the operation that is being\r\ninvoked at runtime. If document style WSDL is used\r\nthen the operation name is only included in the SOAP\r\nmessage if the WSDL conforms to the 'wrapped'\r\npattern - in which case the first tag within the body of\r\nthe SOAP envelope is the name of the operation.\r\nIf the operation name is not included in the SOAP\r\nmessage then CICS requires that each of the operations\r\nin the WSDL have unique signatures.

The task is suspended indefinitely.\r\nExplanation: An internal error has prevented the\r\ntermination of task number tasknum with identifier\r\ntranid. It is not possible to abend the task. The principal\r\nfacility of the task is a transient data queue. The TD\r\nqueue will not trigger another task until CICS is\r\nterminated. Rather than terminate CICS, the transaction\r\nmanager keeps CICS running and preserves its\r\nintegrity by suspending the task.\r\nThe suspended task will hold its MXT slot until CICS is\r\nterminated.\r\nNote that the task may hold resources (for example,\r\nlocks and enqueues) so you should cancel CICS at your\r\nearliest convenience. Otherwise you may risk other\r\ntasks being prevented from running because they also\r\nneed access to the same resources. You may wish to\r\nadd a dump table entry always to terminate CICS on\r\nthis message.\r\nSystem action: The task is suspended indefinitely.\r\nFirst failure diagnostics should be produced by the\r\ncomponent which detected the error.

If changing or simplifying\r\nthe XML schema or WSDL is not acceptable then other\r\noptions exist:\r\nv If you are using DFHWS2LS, then at runtime level\r\n2.1 onwards you can use the XML-ONLY parameter\r\nto opt-out of the CICS supplied XML transformation\r\nservice.

If bbbb is identified as a CICS code, it\r\nmay be either alphameric or numeric.\r\nv\r\nIf the CICS code is alphameric (for example AKEA)\r\nthen it is a CICS transaction abend code.\r\nv\r\nIf the CICS code is numeric (for example 1310), it\r\nrefers to a CICS message (DFHTS1310 in our\r\nexample).\r\nIf the user abend code is from another product (for\r\nexample, IMS), refer to the appropriate messages and\r\ncodes manual to determine the cause of the abend.\r\nThe entries in the appropriate manuals will give the\r\nuser guidance regarding the nature of the error, and\r\nmay also give some guidance concerning the\r\nappropriate user response.\r\nNote: The program check may have occurred in a user\r\nprogram. If this is the case, the program check is\r\nusually followed by an ASRA or an ASRB transaction\r\nabend and a transaction dump.\r\nIf you want to suppress system dumps that precede\r\nASRA and ASRB abends, you must specify this on an\r\nentry in the dump table, using either CEMT or an\r\nEXEC CICS command.

The application took a syncpoint, either\r\nimplicitly or explicitly, and this has caused all local\r\nresources and synclevel 2 partners to be committed.\r\nHowever, when a commit message was sent to a\r\nsynclevel 1 function shipped resource, the reply\r\nindicated that an error has occurred.

This information is held in one of the terminal\r\ninput/output areas. A failure in the communication\r\nsystem might have caused corruption of the data.\r\nReason code 03 indicates that the partner system has\r\nsent an abend. There is an error in the partner system\r\nwhich may need to be investigated.\r\nReason code 04 indicates that the partner system took\r\ntoo long to respond to the synclevel 1 commit.

This implies that\r\nthere may be an error in CICS code. Alternatively,\r\nunexpected data has been input, or storage has been\r\noverwritten.\r\nThe code aaa/bbbb is a three digit hexadecimal MVS\r\ncode (if applicable), followed by a four digit\r\nalphanumeric CICS code. The MVS code is a system\r\ncompletion code (for example, 0C1 or D37). If an MVS\r\ncode is not applicable, this field is filled with three\r\nhyphens.

A message\r\nis issued to this effect.\r\nUser response: Notify the system programmer. If\r\nCICS is still running, it is necessary to decide whether\r\nto terminate CICS.\r\nLook up the MVS code, if there is one, in the relevant\r\nMVS codes manual which is detailed in the book list in\r\nthe front of this manual. Next, look up the CICS\r\nalphanumeric code in this manual. This tells you, for\r\nexample, whether the error was a program check, an\r\nabend, or a runaway, and may give you some guidance\r\nconcerning user response.\r\nIf module modname is not crucial to the running of your\r\nCICS system, you may decide to continue to run and\r\nbring CICS down at a convenient time to resolve the\r\nproblem.\r\nIf you cannot run without the full use of module\r\nmodname you should bring CICS down in a controlled\r\nshutdown.\r\nIf you need further assistance from IBM to resolve this\r\nproblem, see IBM problem support in Troubleshooting\r\nfor guidance on how to proceed.\r\nModule: DFHTISR, DFHTIDM\r\nMessage inserts:\r\n1. applid\r\n2. aaa/bbbb\r\n3.

A message\r\nis issued to this effect.\r\nUser response: If CICS has not been terminated, it is\r\nnecessary to decide whether the problem is serious\r\nenough to bring CICS down.\r\nSince some CICS functions can use a lot of processor\r\ntime, this message may have been caused by a\r\nlong-running function. So there may not be an error\r\nhere. Usually, CICS purges a CICS function which\r\nexceeds the runaway task time interval which you have\r\nspecified in the SIT (this is the ICVR which is measured\r\nin milliseconds). This means that module modname is\r\nterminated and CICS continues.\r\nBut if you have declared ICVR=0 in the SIT and you\r\nconsider that module modname has gone into a loop,\r\nyou have to terminate CICS in order to terminate the\r\nrunaway function.\r\nIf CICS has terminated module modname and you\r\nconsider that it was not a runaway, you should increase\r\nthe ICVR time interval in the SIT. You have to bring\r\nCICS down at a suitable time to do this permanently.\r\nBut you can change the ICVR time interval temporarily\r\nonline, using the CEMT transaction.\r\nIf raising the ICVR time does not solve the problem,\r\nyou will need further assistance from IBM.

If an MVS code is not applicable, this field is\r\nfilled with three hyphens. The 4-digit code bbbb, which\r\nfollows aaa, is a user abend code produced either by\r\nCICS or by another product on the user's system.\r\nIf X'offset' contains the value X'FFFF', then module\r\nmodname was in control at the time of the abend, but\r\nthe program status word (PSW) was not addressing\r\nthis module.\r\nSystem action: An exception entry is made in the\r\ntrace table. A system dump is taken, unless you have\r\nspecifically suppressed dumps in the dump table.\r\nEither this is a critical error and CICS is terminated,\r\neven if you have specified in the dump table that CICS\r\nshould not terminate.\r\nOr CICS will continue unless you have specified in the\r\ndump table that CICS should terminate. Message DFHME0116, which contains the symptom string for this problem, is produced.\r\nUser response: Notify the system programmer.\r\nLook up the MVS code aaa, if there is one, in the\r\nrelevant MVS codes manual which is detailed in the\r\nbook list in the front of this manual.\r\nIf the modname insert contains the value ????, then\r\nCICS was unable to determine which module has\r\nabnormally terminated. In this case, examine the\r\nsystem dump to determine which area of code has\r\ncaused the program check.\r\nThe user should examine other messages to determine\r\nwhat the module which issued this message was doing\r\nat the time the abend occurred. From these messages\r\nthey can deduce which product has produced the\r\nabend code bbbb. If bbbb is identified as a CICS code, it\r\nmay be either alphameric or numeric.\r\nv\r\nIf the CICS code is alphameric (for example AKEA)\r\nthen it is a CICS transaction abend code.\r\nv\r\nIf the CICS code is numeric (for example 1310), it\r\nrefers to a CICS message (DFHTS1310 in our\r\nexample).\r\nIf the user abend code is from another product (for\r\nexample, IMS), refer to the appropriate messages and\r\ncodes manual to determine the cause of the abend.\r\nThe entries in the appropriate manuals will give the\r\nuser guidance regarding the nature of the error, and\r\nmay also give some guidance concerning the\r\nappropriate user response.\r\nNote: The program check may have occurred in a user\r\nprogram. If this is the case, the program check is\r\nusually followed by an ASRA or an ASRB transaction\r\nabend and a transaction dump.\r\nIf you want to suppress system dumps that precede\r\nASRA and ASRB abends, you must specify this on an\r\nentry in the dump table, using either CEMT or an\r\nEXEC CICS command. Further guidance on\r\nsuppressing system dumps can be found in the CICS\r\nSystem Definition Guide.\r\nYou may need further assistance from IBM to resolve\r\nthis problem.

A\r\nmessage is issued to this effect.\r\nMessage DFHME0116, which contains the symptom\r\nstring for this problem, is produced.\r\nUser response: Notify the system programmer. If\r\nCICS has not been terminated, it is necessary to decide\r\nwhether the problem is serious enough to bring CICS\r\ndown.\r\nSince some CICS functions can use a lot of processor\r\ntime, this message may have been caused by a\r\nlong-running function. So there may not be an error\r\nhere. Usually, CICS purges a CICS function which\r\nexceeds the runaway task time interval which you have\r\nspecified in the SIT (this is the ICVR which is measured\r\nin milliseconds). This means that module modname in\r\nthe message is terminated and CICS continues.\r\nBut if you have declared ICVR=0 in the SIT and you\r\nconsider that module modname has gone into a loop,\r\nyou have to terminate CICS in order to terminate the\r\nrunaway function.\r\nIf CICS has terminated module modname, and you\r\nconsider that it was not a runaway, you should increase\r\nthe ICVR time interval in the SIT. You have to bring\r\nCICS down at a suitable time to do this permanently.\r\nBut you can change the ICVR time interval temporarily\r\nonline, using the CEMT transaction.\r\nIf raising the ICVR time does not solve the problem,\r\nyou need further assistance from IBM.

If CICS has not been terminated, it will be necessary to decide whether the problem is serious enough to bring CICS down.\r\nBecause some CICS functions can use a lot of processor\r\ntime, this message may have been caused by a\r\nlong-running function. So there may not be an error\r\nhere. Usually, CICS will purge a CICS function that\r\nexceeds the runaway task time interval that you have\r\nspecified in the SIT (this is the ICVR which is measured\r\nin milliseconds). This means that the module modname\r\nwill be terminated and CICS will continue.\r\nIf you have declared ICVR=0 in the SIT and you\r\nconsider that module modname has gone into a loop,\r\nyou will have to terminate CICS in order to terminate\r\nthe runaway function.\r\nIf CICS has terminated module modname, and you\r\nconsider that it was not a runaway, you should increase\r\nthe ICVR time interval in the SIT. You will have to\r\nbring CICS down at a suitable time to do this\r\npermanently. However, you can change the ICVR time\r\ninterval temporarily online, using the CEMT\r\ntransaction.\r\nIf raising the ICVR time does not solve the problem,\r\nyou may need further assistance from IBM to resolve\r\nthis problem.

So there may not be an error. Usually, CICS\r\npurges a CICS function which exceeds the runaway\r\ntask time interval which you have specified in the SIT\r\n(this is the ICVR which is measured in milliseconds).\r\nThis means that execution of module modname is\r\nterminated and CICS continues.\r\nIf you have specified ICVR=0 in the SIT and you\r\nconsider that module modname has gone into a loop,\r\nyou have to terminate CICS in order to terminate the\r\nrunaway function.\r\nIf the runaway has occurred in module DFHNQIB, it is\r\nprobably the result of a long-running UOWENQ\r\nbrowse. If there are many enqueues in the system\r\n(particularly if many are owned by the same task),\r\nCICS can take a long time to process the browse. This\r\ncan be resolved by increasing the runaway interval\r\nassociated with the task performing the browse. To do\r\nthis change the RUNAWAY attribute of the associated\r\ntransaction definition.\r\nIf CICS has terminated module modname, and you\r\nconsider that it was not a runaway, you should increase\r\nthe ICVR time interval in the SIT.

For example, IBM's\r\nRational Developer for System Z (RDz) product\r\nsupports a \"meet-in-middle\" mapping scenario that\r\nallows omitting of specific XML constructs.\r\nModule: DFHWS2LS, DFHSC2LS\r\nMessage inserts:\r\n1. type\r\nDestination: SYSPRINT", "DFHPI9809": " E When querying a registry a fault was returned with message faultMessage.\r\nExplanation: A SOAP fault was returned by WSRR.\r\nSystem action: The interaction with WSRR was not\r\nperformed.
