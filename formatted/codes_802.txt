If\r\nUNCATLG was specified in the DD statement,dsp appears in the message text as NOT UNCTLGD (not\r\nuncataloged).\r\nw Explains why the data set was not cataloged, recataloged, rolled in, or uncataloged, as follows:\r\nw Explanation\r\n1 A control volume or user catalog was required and a utility program must be used to catalog the\r\ndata set.\r\n2 One of the following has occurred:\r\nv The data set to be cataloged had been cataloged previously. Either a catalog entry already exists\r\nfor the DSNAME specified, or a catalog entry for an ALIAS of another data set matches the\r\nDSNAME specified.\r\nv The data set to be uncataloged could not be located.\r\nv The data set name of the data set to be cataloged in an ICF catalog has the same low-level\r\nqualifier (GnnnnVnn) as a GDG (generation data group) generation. This is not supported by the\r\nICF catalog.\r\nv The data set name of a data set to be cataloged in a user catalog or CVOL has the same high\r\nlevel qualifiers as the name of a catalog entry that already exists in the user catalog or CVOL. For\r\nexample, data set A.B.C.D cannot be cataloged in a CVOL if A.B or A.B.C is already in the\r\ncatalog.\r\nv The data set name to be cataloged or uncataloged has been improperly constructed or modified.\r\nFor example, by means of READJFCB and OPEN TYPE=J.\r\n3 A specified index did not exist.\r\n4 The data set could not be cataloged because space was not available in the catalog data set.\r\n5 Too many volumes were specified for the data set; because of this, not enough storage was\r\navailable to perform the specified cataloging.\r\n6 The data set to be cataloged in a generation index is improperly named.\r\n7 The data set to be cataloged was not opened and the following information was not provided on\r\nthe DD statement or via the retrieved source (VOL=REF or passed data set):\r\nDensity\r\nFor dual density tape requests only\r\nRecording mode\r\nFor requests where compaction information is required\r\n9 One of the following has occurred:\r\nv An input/output error that cannot be corrected occurred in reading or writing the catalog\r\nbecause of a GDG sequencing error. This can happen when the system is trying to catalog a new\r\nGDS whose generation number is lower than an existing GDS, such as when the generation\r\nnumbers wrap from G9999V00 to G0001V00.\r\nv A catalog is expiration date protected but the purge date has not passed.\r\nv The user is denied access to a catalog by the Resource Access Control Facility (RACF).\r\nv The size of the catalog record required to hold all of the information for the data set would\r\nexceed the LRECL of the catalog.\r\nA The VTOC of a DOS volume could not be converted to OS format.\r\n10 SMS is not active, so the CATLG request for a new SMS-managed generation data group (GDG)\r\ngeneration could not be processed. The generation remains in a deferred roll-in state.\r\n11 A system error occurred while trying to catalog, uncatalog, or delete a SMS-managed data set. For\r\nan error that occurred when trying to catalog a new SMS-managed GDG generation, the generation\r\nremains in a deferred roll-in state.\r\n12 The security package determined that access to the data set, GDG base, or catalog was improper, or\r\naccess to the tape volume was not allowed. Alter access is required to a TAPEVOL profile.\r\n13 During device allocation, the system did not use Catalog Services to retrieve the volume or unit\r\ninformation on this dataset. Therefore, it did not uncatalog the dataset.\r\nser The volumes involved, as follows:\r\nv A 6-digit number: The serial number of the volume, which contains labels.\r\nv A number beginning with L: The volume is unlabeled.

Use the PURGE command with the VOLID parameter equal to ser to demount the volume. Vary offline the\r\nSSID shown in the previous IEA000I message.\r\n2. If the SSID is that of the drive with the primary or secondary tables pack, it is necessary to free the pack from\r\ntables use before processing. If the SSID is that of the drive with the secondary tables pack, run the COPYT\r\ncommand. If the SSID is that of the drive with the primary tables pack, run the SWAPT command to make the\r\npack secondary tables pack, and then run the COPYT command. The pack with the error no longer contains\r\nthe primary or secondary tables.\r\n3. Mount the staging pack on a read drive. Use the DFSMSdss utility to assign an alternate track. Remount the\r\npack on an offline staging drive. Vary the SSID for the staging drive online. Restart the failing job step.\r\nv Option 2: If you can specify the mount on another staging drive group to avoid the failing SSID, use the PURGE\r\ncommand with the VOLID parameter equal to ser to demount the volume. Restart the failing step with the\r\nchanged job control language.\r\nIf an I/O error occurred and ser is SCRTCH, do the following:\r\n1. Vary the virtual unit address offline. The device is in the previous 28-byte IEA000I message.\r\n2. Restart the failing step.\r\n3. At a convenient time, reassign the track in error. To do this, mount the staging pack on a real drive, and use\r\nthe DFSMSdss utility to assign an alternate track. Remount the pack on an offline staging drive and vary the\r\nSSID of the staging drive online.\r\nIf there was no preceding ICB194E or IEA000I message, the verification error was due to a mismatch between the\r\nvolume label and the volume in the mount request. The MODIFYV command will change the volume label to match\r\nthe volume information that is in the Inventory data set, Mass Storage Control tables, and the operating system. Do\r\nthe following:\r\n1. Issue the UNLOAD command to demount the volume.\r\n2. If an MSS Access Method Services command was being attempted to correct a volume label mismatch flag\r\ncondition, check to see if the deferred mount parameter was used in the DD statement. If the deferred mount\r\nparameter was not used, correct the JCL DD statement, and restart the failing step.\r\n3. If a specific volume request (with job control language, by the catalog, or by load) for this volume caused the\r\nverification attempt, use the previous messages or the LISTMSVI command output to determine if the volume\r\nlabel mismatch flag is on. If the mismatch flag is on, the LISTMSVI command output will have a Note (Note:\r\nPrior rename failed for above volume;) printed after the volume record of the volume that encountered the\r\nproblem.\r\n4.

Most likely, this is due to an IPL-time subsystem or system service that simply marked the Unit\r\nControl Block (UCB) allocated, and subsequently failed to mark the unit unallocated. However, if you know of a\r\nsystem service that marks a unit allocated in this way, and has not terminated yet (that is, the system service or\r\nprogram is still up and running and may actively be using the unit), leave the device offline (once it goes offline),\r\nsince that system service is still allocated to it. Otherwise, it is probably safe to bring the unit back online,\r\nparticularly if it is a sharable device (that is, DASD).

While this message remains outstanding, no other allocations for any device(s) within the esoteric (group name)\r\nor generic being waited for in the reply to this message can proceed. That is, if a job is in allocation recovery\r\ntrying to allocate a 3490 device (UNIT=3490), then no other D/T3490 allocations will take place until after this\r\nmessage is satisfied. Similarly, if a job was trying to allocate a device in an esoteric group named CARTNY\r\n(UNIT=CARTNY), then no devices in that esoteric group would be allocated until this message is satisfied.\r\n3. While this message remains outstanding or if the reply to this message is WAIT, no other allocations,\r\nunallocations, OPENs, CLOSEs, Catalog LOCATEs, data set OBTAINs, or End-of-Volume (EOV or FEOV)\r\nprocessing will be able to take place within this address space until this message is replied to and the wait is\r\nfulfilled. This is because the address space's SYSZTIOT resource is held EXCLusive by this allocation. This\r\nstatement is true even if an unallocation would free up the device required by this allocation.\r\n4. While this message remains outstanding or if the reply to this message is WAIT, no HCD Activates will be able to\r\ncomplete processing.\r\nSystem action: The system action depends on the operator's response as follows:\r\nReply of WAIT\r\nRequests device allocation for this job to wait until the required units or volumes, or both, are released or are\r\nbrought online; that is, no other allocations for any devices will be able to be done within the address space\r\nwhich issued the message until the wait is satisfied. Further, no services which require the SYSZTIOT resource\r\nwithin that address space will be able to proceed until the wait is satisfied. This includes services such as OPEN,\r\nOPENJ, CLOSE, LOCATE, OBTAIN, CATALOG and SCRATCH. The wait does not take effect, however, until all\r\nDD statements that require devices for case two above have been processed and the operator has responded to\r\nmessage IEF433D. The system issues message IEF877E OR IEF878I for any remaining DD statements and this\r\nmessage.\r\nNote: A unit must be unallocated or varied online in order for the wait to be satisfied. Simply unloading a unit\r\nwhich was made unavailable to other jobs via a MOUNT command will not satisfy the wait.\r\nReply of a device name in the list of message IEF877E or IEF878I.\r\nCauses the system to place the device online and retry device allocation.\r\nNote: The system may or may not actually use the specified device to satisfy the allocation request. If other\r\neligible devices are found when the allocation is retried (for example, an eligible device was unallocated before\r\nthe IEF238D message was replied to), then the system may choose from any of the eligible devices. Alternatively,\r\nafter the device is brought online, but before the device allocation is retried, it is possible for another job to\r\nallocate the device that was brought online. This can result in message IEF238D being reissued.\r\nReply of CANCEL\r\nFor JCL Allocations:\r\nCauses the system to end the job without further attempts to complete allocation.\r\nFor Dynamic Allocations:\r\nCauses only the allocation request to fail; it does not end the entire job.\r\nReply of DUMP\r\nCauses the system to issue an SVC DUMP to gather diagnostic information that can be provided to the IBM\r\nSupport Center. This option should generally only be used if IEF238D was issued unexpectedly, or upon request\r\nof IBM Support. After the dump is issued, the system will reissue message IEF238D to allow another operator\r\nresponse.\r\nNote: DUMP is always a valid reply to message IEF238D. However, DUMP is never listed in the text of message IEF238D as an option.\r\nIf the reply was not valid for the options given in this message, the system issues message IEF490I and repeats this\r\nmessage.\r\nOperator response: Reply as follows:\r\nv REPLY id,\u2018 dev\u2019, where dev is a device number in message IEF877E or IEF878I and the device can be brought online.\r\nIf device dev was listed as NOT ACCESSIBLE, enter a VARY CPU/CH/PATH command before this reply.

The system is waiting for the operator to respond, based on the following:\r\nv For a batch job, the system can either:\r\n\u2013 Release the devices that have already been allocated to the job and cannot be shared with other jobs.\r\n\u2013 Leave the devices allocated until the job can be completely allocated.\r\nv\r\nIf the allocation is dynamic, the system can either:\r\n\u2013 Release only the devices requested by that particular SVC 99\r\n\u2013 Leave the devices allocated until the job's outstanding requests can be completely allocated.\r\nv\r\nIf no online devices are available, then pending offline devices may be allocated to satisfy the request.\r\nIn the message text:\r\njobname The name of the job.\r\nSystem action: The system action depends on whether the operator responds with HOLD or NOHOLD. In either\r\ncase, allocations to direct access devices are not released. If these allocations are for NEW data sets, the space those\r\ndata sets are to occupy is already allocated but not used until all the devices needed by this job are available (that is,\r\nuntil the WAIT situation has been relieved).\r\nv If the reply is HOLD, the system will not release any of the devices that have already been allocated to this job\r\nbefore it waits for the required units or volumes.\r\nBe aware that using the HOLD reply might cause a deadlock situation, particularly when the device is being used\r\nby a job that is going to wait. The system does not release any non-sharable devices (that is, non-DASD) that have\r\nalready been allocated to the job before it waits for required units and volumes. To avoid this problem, only one\r\njob in the system should use the HOLD option at a time.\r\nAlso Note that replying HOLD prevents any subsequent vary offline requests from completing successfully, until\r\neither the HOLD is satisfied (required devices become available) or the job is cancelled. Vary offline requests issued\r\nwhile HOLD is in effect and the device to be varied offline is placed in a pending offline condition. When the\r\nHOLD condition is relieved, the system completes vary offline processing normally.\r\nWhen devices for a job are held during a wait, and a device that was eligible for allocation to the job becomes\r\nineligible for allocation (because of its use by a system utility, for example), the job might fail because it does not\r\nhave enough devices to complete successfully. Message IEF700I in the job log identifies this failure. Refer to\r\nmessage IEF700I for information on how to respond to this failure.\r\nv If the reply is NOHOLD, the system will release those devices that have been allocated to this job, but that cannot\r\nbe shared with other jobs.\r\nv Regardless of whether the reply to this message is HOLD or NOHOLD, or if the message is left outstanding (not\r\nreplied to), no other allocations, unallocations, OPENs, CLOSEs, Catalog LOCATEs, data set OBTAINs, or\r\nEnd-of-Volume (EOV or FEOV) processing will be able to take place within this address space until this message is\r\nreplied to and the WAIT is fulfilled. This is because the address space's SYSZTIOT resource is held EXCLusive by\r\nthis allocation. This statement is true even if an unallocation would free up the device required by this allocation.\r\nFor an example of the HOLD versus NOHOLD options, assume that JOBA owns an automatically switchable device\r\nand is waiting for a printer. Assume also that JOBB owns the printer JOBA needs and is waiting for the automatically\r\nswitchable device JOBA owns.\r\nv If the reply is HOLD for each job, the two jobs will wait until one job is cancelled. This deadlock can be even more\r\ncomplex depending on the number of jobs waiting.\r\nv If the reply is NOHOLD for each job, allocation responds on a first-come, first-served basis. After the first job\r\nfinishes using a resource, it is available to the second.\r\nv If the reply is NOHOLD for JOBA and HOLD for JOBB, the system will release the automatically switchable device\r\nthat had been allocated to JOBA. This device is now available for JOBB. JOBA will wait until JOBB unallocates the\r\nprinter.\r\nv If the reply is NOHOLD for JOBB and HOLD for JOBA, the system will release the printer that had been allocated\r\nto JOBB. This device is now available for JOBA. JOBB will wait until JOBA unallocates the automatically\r\nswitchable device.\r\nOperator response: Do one of the following:\r\nv Reply xx,\u2018HOLD\u2019 to have the system wait while holding the devices already allocated.\r\nv Reply xx,\u2018NOHOLD\u2019 to have the system release the devices that are not shareable before it waits.\r\nSystem programmer response: If a manual response to this message is not desired, refer to z/OS MVS Initialization\r\nand Tuning Reference for information on how to use the ALLOCxx parmlib member to set a policy that will allow the\r\nsystem to automatically reply \u2018HOLD\u2019 or \u2018NOHOLD\u2019.\r\nSource: Allocation\r\nModule: IEFAB487\r\nRouting code: 2, 3/4/7\r\nDescriptor code: 2", "IFA364I": " nnnnnn RECORDS WITH DATES LATER THAN IFAURP EXECUTION DATE\r\nExplanation: The usage report program has found nnnnnn SMF type 89 records that contain unsupported values in\r\none or more date fields and has excluded these records from further processing.

The\r\nsystem will delete the message if the usage falls below 90% or the job step ends.\r\nSystem programmer response: Check the documentation for the job or subsystem and determine if you can lower\r\nthe limits to avoid filling the area completely and thus avoid allocation failures.

You might also need to reduce the\r\nnumber of volumes (VOLCOUNT) in the data class for the data sets that the job is using.\r\nProblem determination: Examine the data class for data sets that are being used by the job and lower the volume\r\ncount or dynamic volume count if possible.

The\r\nallocation requests are waiting for MOUNTs or exclusive access to a shared device or data set.

One of the\r\nfollowing then occurs:\r\nv If WAIT is specified in response to this message, the system continues waiting for the previous EDT to be freed\r\nbefore continuing with the configuration change request. After one minute, if the configuration change has not\r\ncompleted, this message will be reissued.\r\nv If TERM is specified in response to this message, the system attempts to cancel the configuration change and\r\nback-out from the intermediate EDT to the original EDT.\r\nMessage IEF739D is issued while transitioning from the original EDT to the intermediate EDT, which means that\r\nthe original EDT is the secondary EDT and the intermediate EDT is the primary EDT. All new allocation requests\r\nare directed to the intermediate EDT because it is the primary EDT.\r\nWhen TERM is specified, the system switches back to the original EDT by changing the primary EDT to be the\r\noriginal EDT and the secondary EDT to be the intermediate EDT, so that all new allocation requests are directed to\r\nthe original EDT. Although the attempt to back-out the configuration change proceeds, all jobs that are using the\r\nintermediate EDT (now the secondary EDT) must release the secondary EDT before the configuration change is\r\ncompletely backed-out and the ACTIVATE completes. The DISPLAY IOS,CONFIG(EDT) command can be used to\r\ndetermine which EDT is the original and which is the intermediate.\r\nRegardless of the EDT transition that is occurring, any jobs that use the secondary EDT will prevent the EDT\r\ntransition from proceeding, whether the system is waiting for the configuration change to proceed, or waiting for\r\nthe back-out of the configuration change to proceed. The DISPLAY IOS,CONFIG(EDT) command can be used to\r\ndetermine any allocation requests that are using the secondary EDT.\r\nRemember that when replying TERM, the primary and secondary EDTs change. Once any allocation requests that\r\nare using the secondary EDT complete, the system completes the EDT transition.\r\nFor further information about EDT transitions, see the information on Eligible Device Tables in z/OS MVS\r\nDiagnosis: Reference.\r\nIf backing-out the configuration change is delayed because of allocations using the secondary EDT after replying\r\nTERM, message IOS513E is issued.\r\nOperator response: Do one of the following:\r\nv To continue waiting, satisfy all MOUNT requests and either continue to wait or cancel all jobs waiting for\r\nallocation. The previous messages identify these jobs, or issue 'DISPLAY IOS,CONFIG(EDT)' to determine the\r\nASIDs and jobnames. Then reply WAIT to this message.\r\nv If jobs currently waiting for allocation should not be cancelled and the configuration change has been waiting for\r\nsome time, reply TERM to this message. This causes the system to attempt to end the ACTIVATE request and free\r\nsystem resources. However, the system cannot finish back-out processing until the intermediate EDT that was built\r\nis no longer in use. Upon replying TERM, this intermediate EDT becomes the secondary EDT. If the system later\r\nissues message IOS513E, issue D IOS,CONFIG(EDT) to determine the jobs and allocation requests that are still\r\nusing the secondary EDT. It may be necessary to take additional actions, as described in message IOS513E, so that\r\nthese jobs and allocation requests release the secondary EDT. Once those jobs and allocation requests have released\r\nthe secondary EDT, the ACTIVATE command finishes backing-out the configuration changes and returns to the\r\nconfiguration that was active prior to the issuance of the ACTIVATE command.\r\nIf you end the configuration change, enter the ACTIVATE command again when jobs currently waiting for allocation\r\nhave completed or have been cancelled.\r\nSource: Allocation\r\nModule: IEFECS07\r\nRouting code: 1\r\nDescriptor code: 2", "IEF404I": " jobname -ENDED [-TIME=hh.mm.ss ]\r\nExplanation: In response to a MONITOR JOBNAMES command, a job has ended.\r\nNote: This message will not be issued for X'n22' ABEND codes.
