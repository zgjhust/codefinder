This means that the module modname\r\nwill be terminated and CICS will continue.\r\nBut if you have declared ICVR=0 in the SIT and you\r\nconsider that module modname has gone into a loop,\r\nyou will have to terminate CICS in order to terminate\r\nthe runaway function.\r\nIf CICS has terminated module modname, and you\r\nconsider that it was not a runaway, you should increase\r\nthe ICVR time interval in the SIT.

It is not issued if a trim\r\ndoes not occur for the secondary system log stream\r\n(DFHSHUNT). This is since a trim of the primary\r\nsystem log stream is considerably more likely to occur\r\nper keypoint, and hence failures to trim the primary\r\nsystem log stream should be recognized, and\r\ninvestigated if required.\r\nSystem action: CICS continues processing.\r\nUser response: This is an informational message, but\r\nshould be treated as a warning of a potential problem\r\nif the number of keypoints that have been unable to\r\ntrim the primary system log stream continues to\r\nincrease. Occasional keypoints that fail to trim\r\nDFHLOG are not unexpected events. However, if the\r\nmessage is issued by a number of sequential keypoints\r\nthen this warrants further investigation.\r\nThe keypoint operation was unable to trim the tail of\r\nDFHLOG because the oldest log records on the log\r\nstream belong to a Unit Of Work (UOW) that is still\r\nrequired. This may be a validly long-running UOW;\r\nalternatively, it may be part of a long-running task\r\nexecuting an application that generates log records but\r\ndoes not issue syncpoint requests regularly enough.\r\nThis may be a transient phenomenon due to an atypical\r\nlong-running UOW. Review the number of keypoints\r\nthat have been unable to trim the log. Check what\r\nmessage CICS issues for log stream lsn at the next\r\nactivity keypoint. Message DFHLG0743 indicates the\r\nlog stream is now successfully trimmed. Another DFHLG0760 message indicates a long-running UOW still exists on the system. If the log stream still cannot be trimmed, use the CEMT INQUIRE UOW command to review the oldest UOWs on the system.  The transaction identifier and the task number of the task whose UOW relates to the oldest data on DFHLOG are also provided in the DFHLG0760 message. The CEMT INQUIRE TASK command may be used to review them.\r\nIt is also worthwhile reviewing how often CICS is performing activity keypoints (as defined by the AKPFREQ system definition parameter).\r\nModule: DFHL2CHE\r\nMessage inserts:\r\n1. date\r\n2. time\r\n3. applid\r\n4. lsn\r\n5. trimnum\r\n6. transid\r\n7. trannum\r\nDestination: CSMT", "DFHMQ0759": " E date time applid tranid trannum Transaction transid is not defined to CICS.\r\nExplanation: A request has been received to run the\r\ntransaction listed but it is not defined to this CICS\r\nsystem.\r\nSystem action: See topic Error handling by the\r\nCICS-WebSphere MQ bridge in Troubleshooting and\r\nsupport in the CICS Infocenter.\r\nUser response: Correct the request or define the\r\ntransaction.\r\nModule: DFHMQBP0, DFHMQBR0\r\nMessage inserts:\r\n1. date\r\n2. time\r\n3. applid\r\n4. tranid\r\n5. trannum\r\n6. transid\r\nDestination: CMQM, Console and Terminal End User", "DFHMQ0758": " E date time applid tranid trannum Unable to START bridge task.

MVS logger codes: X'ret', X'rsn'. Log stream attributes: SYSTEMLOG({YES | NO}), DASDONLY({YES | NO}), STRUCTNAME(structname), RETPD(X'retpd'), AUTODELETE({YES | NO}).\r\nExplanation: The CICS log manager made a call to the\r\nMVS logger to access a log, which returned an error\r\ncondition. The MVS logger operation that returned the\r\nerror condition is identified in the message, and the\r\nreturn and reason codes shown are those returned by\r\nthe MVS logger.

These attributes are only valid following a\r\nsuccessful connection.\r\nThis message may be followed by other CICS\r\nmessages, especially if the log stream is part of the\r\nCICS system log.\r\nThis situation can occur when CICS calls the MVS\r\nlogger using an obsolete log stream connection token,\r\nwhen the MVS logger has been restarted following\r\neither a crash or a user request. A restart of the MVS\r\nlogger implicitly disconnects all connections to it.\r\nFor further guidance, see the z/OS MVS Programming:\r\nAssembler Services Reference.\r\nNote: a reason code of x'0000085D' means an\r\nIxgRsnCodeWowError has been returned from the\r\nz/OS Logger.

The SRB was scheduled, directly\r\nor indirectly, by CICS in order to issue a VTAM\r\nauthorized path request.\r\nA message could not be issued because the error was\r\ndetected when running under an SRB.\r\nDiagnostics: The error is handled by a functional\r\nrecovery routine (FRR) in DFHKCSP. This FRR saves\r\nthe system diagnostic work area (SDWA) if one was\r\nprovided, and issues a CALLRTM to terminate the\r\nCICS TCB with user abend code 0308.\r\nThis, in turn, causes the ESTAE exit established by\r\nDFHKESTX to be taken, resulting in the storing of the\r\nCICS TCB status and provision of a dump as for\r\nabends occurring during execution under the CICS\r\nTCB.\r\nThe SDWA saved by DFHKCSP may be located in the\r\ndump by:\r\nv\r\nFinding the module itself (look for characters\r\n'DFHKCSP').\r\nv\r\nFinding the save area (look for characters 'SRB\r\nSDWA SAVE AREA'); the SDWA follows this\r\ncharacter string.\r\nAnalysis: The SDWA, located as described above, is a\r\nstandard MVS SDWA. The principal contents of the\r\nSDWA are:\r\nSDWAGRSV\r\nGeneral registers 0 through 15\r\nSDWAEC1\r\nProgram status word (PSW) at the time of the\r\ninterrupt.\r\nIn general, registers 12 and 13 will not address a TCA\r\nor the CSA.\r\nThe registers and PSW recorded in DFHKESTX\r\nrepresent the state of the CICS TCB when CICS was\r\nterminated by the FRR. Normally this information is\r\nnot relevant to the cause of the failure, but may give\r\nclues to the environment in which the SRB was\r\nrunning.\r\nSystem action: CICS is terminated with user abend\r\ncode U0308. The system diagnostic work area (SDWA)\r\npresented at the time of error is copied into module\r\nDFHKCSP. DFHKCSP resides in protected storage and\r\ncan be printed from an MVS region dump.\r\nUser response: Locate the SDWA, situated in\r\nDFHKCSP after the characters \u201cSRB SDWA WORK\r\nAREA\u201d. This contains the PSW and registers at the time\r\nof the error.\r\nIf the address in SDWAEC1 is in CICS code, examine\r\nthe code to determine the expected register contents at\r\nthis point. If this does not suggest any obvious local\r\nproblem, look for a pointer to the RPL associated with\r\nthe SRB mode execution. This will indicate the location\r\nof the MVS save area.\r\nIf the address in SDWAEC1 is not in CICS code (that is\r\nin MVS), try using the contents of register 13 to trace\r\nback through the save areas to the one provided by\r\nCICS. The contents of this save area will show the\r\npoint of call in CICS (in DFHZHPRX), and the\r\narguments passed to the access method, in particular\r\nthe address of the RPL (register 1). Failure in an access\r\nmethod may be due to an incorrect RPL. Therefore\r\ncheck the ACB address, entry point, and I/O area\r\naddress.\r\nNote: When CICS is executing in SRB mode, it is not\r\npossible for the message to be issued.

This means that module modname in\r\nthe message is terminated and CICS continues.\r\nBut if you have declared ICVR=0 in the SIT and you\r\nconsider that module modname has gone into a loop,\r\nyou have to terminate CICS in order to terminate the\r\nrunaway function.\r\nIf CICS has terminated module modname, and you\r\nconsider that it was not a runaway, you should increase\r\nthe ICVR time interval in the SIT.

The request has failed. File name filename. Data set name dsname.\r\nExplanation: A program has issued a request using a\r\n32-bit RBA against an extended addressing ESDS data\r\nset, which would normally be accessed by a 64-bit\r\nXRBA. The request failed. For extended addressing\r\nESDS data sets, some types of file control commands\r\nare only supported with the XRBA keyword and are\r\nnot supported with the RBA keyword.\r\nThe name of the file used is filename.. The data set is\r\ndsname.\r\nUse of 32-bit RBAs with an extended addressing ESDS\r\nis allowed to enable existing programs to be used with\r\nextended addressing data sets. There are some\r\nlimitations to what can be done by such programs\r\nbecause the RBA supplied is actually the low 32-bits of\r\nthe 64-bit XRBA and is potentially ambiguous.\r\nThe normal way of using ESDS data sets is to write\r\nrecords sequentially and then subsequently read the\r\nrecords back by a browse. This method of using an\r\nextended addressing ESDS with RBAs is supported and\r\nit should be possible to use most existing programs\r\nwith an extended addressing ESDS. Programs that\r\nwrite records to an ESDS will work. Programs that\r\nbrowse the data set either from the beginning or the\r\nend will work.\r\nHowever the following are not supported because they\r\nall rely on the value of the RBA.\r\nv\r\nAn attempt to read a record by RBA by a READ or\r\nREAD UPDATE command.\r\nv\r\nAn attempt to start a browse (by STARTBR) at any\r\nposition other than the beginning of the data set\r\n(RBA 0) or the end of the data set (RBA -1).\r\nv\r\nAn attempt to reposition a browse (by RESETBR) at\r\nany position other than the beginning of the data set\r\n(RBA 0) or the end of the data set (RBA -1).\r\nv\r\nAn attempt to change the position of the browse by\r\nchanging the value of the RBA between successive\r\nREADNEXT requests.\r\nv\r\nAn attempt to change the position of the browse by\r\nchanging the value of the RBA between successive\r\nREADPREV requests.\r\nv\r\nAn attempt to change the direction of a browse by\r\nfollowing a READNEXT by a READPREV or by\r\nfollowing a READPREV by a READNEXT.\r\nIn order to avoid flooding the system with messages,\r\nyou will only receive one instance of message DFHFC6038 for each file against which an unsupported\r\nrequest is issued. It is possible that other programs are\r\nissuing unsupported RBA requests against the same\r\nfile.\r\nSystem action: CICS continues processing.\r\nUser response: If you do not need to store more than\r\n4 gigabytes of data in the data set, you may be able to\r\nleave the program unchanged and convert the data set\r\nto one that does not use extended addressing.\r\nOtherwise you must change the program to use XRBA\r\nrather than RBA. When changing the program, you\r\nmust change all 4-byte areas that hold RBAs into 8-byte\r\nareas to hold XRBAs, as well as changing the RBA\r\nkeyword to XRBA.\r\nModule: DFHFCVS, DFHFCRS\r\nMessage inserts:\r\n1.

This means that the\r\nRLS VSAM server is not available so file control has\r\ndisabled RLS access. The return code was returned by\r\nthe SHOWCB macro when CICS was attempting to find\r\nthe reason for the open failure that had just been\r\ndetected.\r\nSystem action: CICS continues processing with file\r\nfilename closed and its state UNENABLED. Any\r\ntransaction attempting to use RLS files is sent a\r\nNOTOPEN condition.

Because of this error, it may not be\r\npossible to access VSAM RLS again during this CICS\r\nrun.\r\nAccess is made available again only if the VSAM RLS\r\nserver in this MVS system fails causing CICS to\r\nperform dynamic RLS restart processing when it\r\nrestarts, or if you choose to deliberately recycle the RLS\r\nserver to trigger a dynamic restart.\r\nSystem action: CICS continues, but with access to\r\nVSAM RLS disabled (unless an offsite restart is being\r\nperformed). Other CICS functions, including access to\r\nnon-RLS VSAM files, should continue.\r\nAt the time the error affecting RLS restart is detected,\r\nCICS issues one or more messages and takes a system\r\ndump.\r\nThis error might also affect other aspects of this CICS\r\nsystem, for example if it is due to the corruption of\r\ninternal CICS control structures.\r\nIf an offsite restart is being performed; that is, if\r\nOFFSITE=YES was specified as a system initialization\r\noverride, then CICS does not continue, but is\r\nterminated with a system dump.

This has\r\nresulted in the loss of VSAM RLS locks. SMSVSAM has\r\nnotified CICS of this event so that CICS can perform\r\nlost locks recovery processing. In the course of this\r\nprocessing, CICS has attempted to purge inflight\r\ntransactions that hold one or more of the lost locks in\r\norder to expedite recovery from the lost locks\r\ncondition. However, it has not been possible to purge\r\nall of the transactions.\r\nRLS lost locks recovery cannot complete until all\r\nUOWs that have updated data sets in RLS mode are\r\ncompleted. It is unlikely that an inflight transaction can\r\ncomplete normally in a lost locks situation because it\r\nwill abend at the next attempt to access RLS.

Quiesce will be cancelled. Data set dsname\r\nExplanation: The request made to VSAM RLS to\r\nquiesce base data set dsname throughout the sysplex\r\nhas timed out. The timeout limit is given by the system\r\ninitialization parameter QUIESTIM.\r\nThis is probably due to the presence of long-running\r\ntransactions on a participating CICS region failing to\r\nreach syncpoint, and therefore preventing the close of\r\nfiles open against the data set.\r\nSystem action: CICS cancels the quiesce throughout\r\nthe sysplex by issuing an unquiesce for the data set.\r\nDepending upon the timing of the unquiesce request,\r\none of two situations can result:\r\n1.\r\nNormally the unquiesce is processed immediately\r\nand the quiesce request is canceled by VSAM.

CICS will perform lost locks recovery.\r\nExplanation: CICS had one or more data sets open in\r\nRLS access mode at the time of a failure of the coupling\r\nfacility lock structure from which SMSVSAM was not\r\nable to recover transparently. As a result, the RLS locks\r\nheld by CICS for those data sets have been lost.\r\nSMSVSAM has informed CICS that one or more data\r\nsets are in a lost locks state with respect to this CICS.\r\nCICS must therefore perform lost locks recovery for\r\nthose data sets.\r\nThis can occur on a CICS warm or emergency restart,\r\nand on a dynamic RLS restart. On a CICS cold or initial\r\nstart, if there are any data sets with lost locks status,\r\nthat status is cleared with respect to this CICS.\r\nSystem action: The data sets with lost locks status are\r\nmarked as being unavailable for general use. Units of\r\nwork that attempt to access such data sets abend with\r\nan AFCU abend code.\r\nCICS performs lost locks recovery for the data sets. For\r\neach data set, lost locks recovery involves waiting until\r\nall units of work that had made uncommitted updates\r\nto the data set have completed. These units of work are\r\nallowed to access the data set, in order to perform their\r\nrecovery. When CICS has completed lost locks recovery\r\nfor a data set, it reports this fact to SMSVSAM. When\r\nall CICS regions that had been accessing the data set\r\nhave completed their lost locks recovery, then the data\r\nset is made available for general use again. Note that a\r\ndata set becomes available for general use as soon as its\r\nlost locks recovery has been completed; it does not\r\nhave to wait for all data sets to be recovered.\r\nCICS takes the following actions to expedite lost locks\r\nrecovery:\r\nv\r\nBackout-failed and commit-failed units of work are\r\ndriven for retry\r\nv\r\nOn a dynamic RLS restart, inflight transactions that\r\nhad updated the data set are purged (on a warm or\r\nemergency restart, inflight units of work are\r\nautomatically backed out).\r\nUser response: Lost locks recovery normally\r\ncompletes automatically without requiring any action\r\nfrom the user. However, if there are shunted units of\r\nwork which had updated a data set with lost locks\r\nstatus, these prevent lost locks recovery from\r\ncompleting until they are resolved. Use the INQUIRE\r\nUOWDSNFAIL command to investigate these shunted\r\nunits of work.\r\nIf lost locks recovery appears to be taking a long time,\r\nyou can compare the output obtained by issuing the\r\nIDCAMS SHCDS LISTSUBSYS(ALL) command at\r\ndifferent intervals, to determine what progress has been\r\nmade.\r\nSee the CICS Recovery and Restart Guide for guidance\r\non resolving shunted units of work which hold RLS\r\nretained locks.\r\nModule: DFHFCRR\r\nMessage inserts:\r\n1. applid\r\nDestination: Console", "DFHFC0556": " applid Unexpected notification of completion of lost locks recovery for data set dsname.\r\nExplanation: CICS has received a notification from\r\nSMSVSAM that lost locks recovery has completed for\r\ndata set dsname, but CICS still has outstanding lost\r\nlocks recovery work for that data set.

Alternatively, you can use the CEMT SET\r\nDSNAME command which will force all in-doubt units\r\nof work which had updated the specified data set.\r\nHowever, you should not normally use these\r\ncommands because they can cause this CICS to become\r\nout of step with its coordinating system with\r\nconsequent loss of data integrity.\r\nIf you cannot resolve the problem or the problem\r\nrecurs, there may be a more severe error.

For the meaning of the VSAM\r\ncodes, see z/OS DFSMS Macro Instructions for Data\r\nSets.\r\nThe most likely reason for the failure to convert locks\r\ninto retained locks is that the SMSVSAM server was\r\nnot available. It is also possible to get a failure because\r\nthe specified logical unit of work ID does not exist for\r\nthe subsystem (that is, the unit of work does not hold\r\nany locks) during lost locks recovery, or after a CICS\r\nrestart which specified OFFSITE=YES as a system\r\ninitialization override. If you are performing RLS lost\r\nlocks recovery, message DFHFC0555 will have been\r\nissued when lost locks recovery started; if you are\r\nperforming RLS offsite recovery, message DFHFC0574\r\nwill have been issued during file control initialization.\r\nOther VSAM codes may indicate a more severe error.\r\nNormally no other action is necessary. When the\r\ncondition that caused the backout failure has been\r\nresolved, the backout of this unit of work is retried. If\r\nthe attempt to retry the backout succeeds, all locks are\r\nreleased.\r\nMessage DFHFC4701 specifies the cause of the backout\r\nfailure. The most common cause of backout failures is a\r\nhardware problem causing I/O errors. In this case the\r\ndata set needs to be restored and forward recovered. If\r\nCICSVR (or a functionally equivalent product) is used\r\nto perform forward recovery, and the data set was\r\nbeing accessed in RLS mode, units of work that have\r\nfailed backout for this data set are retried automatically.\r\nIf the data set was quiesced, you need to unquiesce it\r\nto allow the backout to succeed. When the data set is\r\nunquiesced, CICS automatically retries the backout.\r\nBackouts may also be retried using\r\nCEMT SET DSNAME RETRY\r\nor\r\nEXEC CICS SET DSNAME(dsname) ACTION(RETRY)\r\n.\r\nThe only problem that you may encounter is that some\r\nlocks may have been left as active locks. This can cause\r\na slow response (and eventual failures) from\r\ntransactions that wait for these locks and have to wait\r\nfor their full timeout interval.\r\nIn this case, consider releasing all locks held against\r\nthis data set using the CEMT SET DSNAME\r\nRESETLOCKS command. This command should only\r\nbe considered in extreme cases because it discards both\r\nthe retained locks held by this CICS system against the\r\nnamed data set and all associated log records. The\r\nconsequence is that the corresponding backout\r\noperations are never performed and data integrity is\r\nlost.\r\nIf you cannot resolve the problem or the problem\r\nrecurs, there may be a more severe error.

This implies\r\nthat there may be an error in the CICS code.\r\nAlternatively, unexpected data has been input, or\r\nstorage has been overwritten.\r\nThe code aaa/bbbb is a 3-digit hexadecimal MVS code (if\r\napplicable), followed by a 4-digit alphanumeric CICS\r\ncode. The MVS code is a system completion code (for\r\nexample, 0C1 or D37). If an MVS code is not applicable,\r\nthis field is filled with three hyphens. The CICS code is\r\nan abend code or a number referring to a CICS\r\nmessage (for example, AKEA is a CICS abend code;\r\n1310 refers to message DFHTS1310).\r\nSystem action: An exception entry is made in the\r\ntrace table.

If\r\nCICS is still running, it is necessary to decide whether\r\nto terminate CICS.\r\nLook up the MVS code, if there is one, in the relevant\r\nMVS codes manual.\r\nNext, look up the CICS alphanumeric code. This tells\r\nyou, for example, whether the error was a program\r\ncheck, an abend, or a runaway, and may give you some\r\nguidance concerning user response.\r\nIf module modname is not crucial to the running of your\r\nCICS system, you may decide to continue to run and\r\nbring CICS down at a convenient time to resolve the\r\nproblem.

So there may not be an error here. Usually,\r\nCICS will purge a CICS function which exceeds the\r\nrunaway task time interval which you have specified in\r\nthe SIT (this is the ICVR which is measured in\r\nmilliseconds). This means that module module will be\r\nterminated and CICS will continue.\r\nBut if you have declared ICVR=0 in the SIT and you\r\nconsider that module modname has gone into a loop,\r\nyou will have to terminate CICS in order to terminate\r\nthe runaway function.\r\nIf CICS has terminated module modname, and you\r\nconsider that it was not a runaway, you should increase\r\nthe ICVR time interval in the SIT. You will have to\r\nbring CICS down at a suitable time to do this\r\npermanently. But you can change the ICVR time\r\ninterval temporarily online, using the CEMT\r\ntransaction.\r\nIf raising the ICVR time does not solve the problem,\r\nyou will need further assistance from IBM.

This situation is likely to arise if CICS\r\nfails to close a file defined with\r\nBACKUPTYPE=DYNAMIC during CICS termination.\r\nSystem action: CICS updates the ICF catalog recovery\r\npoint and open processing continues.\r\nUser response: To ensure complete data integrity,\r\nquiesce all files opened against this base data set and\r\ntake a backup copy.

This is because CICS has detected an\r\nattribute conflict between the opening CICS resource\r\ndefinition and the base data set's DSNB which was\r\nalready opened for update. A FILE resource definition\r\nwith a BACKUPTYPE=STATIC cannot be opened\r\nagainst a DSNB which already has or had a FILE\r\nresource definition opened against it with\r\nBACKUPTYPE=DYNAMIC. Similarly, a FILE resource\r\ndefinition with a BACKUPTYPE=DYNAMIC cannot be\r\nopened against a DSNB which already has or had a\r\nresource definition opened against it with\r\nBACKUPTYPE=STATIC.\r\nNote: A CICS base data set's DSNB cannot change\r\nBACKUPTYPE midway through a CICS run.

This means that the module modname\r\nwill be terminated and CICS will continue.\r\nIf you have declared ICVR=0 in the SIT and you\r\nconsider that module modname has gone into a loop,\r\nyou will have to terminate CICS in order to terminate\r\nthe runaway function.\r\nIf CICS has terminated module modname, and you\r\nconsider that it was not a runaway, you should increase\r\nthe ICVR time interval in the SIT.

You have to bring\r\nCICS down at a suitable time to do this permanently.\r\nHowever, you can change the ICVR time interval\r\ntemporarily online, using the CEMT transaction.\r\nIf raising the ICVR time does not solve the problem,\r\nyou will need further assistance from IBM.

If you\r\naccessed the file in RLS mode, there are extra\r\nsteps required to ensure that the retained locks\r\nremain associated with the data set.

This is a very rare occurrence since the\r\nfailure and restart must have taken place after\r\nthe record to be backed out was read for\r\nupdate, and before it was rewritten or deleted.\r\nA retry of the backout should be successful,\r\nbut because the server has already become\r\navailable, backout will not be automatically\r\nretried. You should use SET DSNAME RETRY\r\nto drive backout retry.\r\nC3\r\nThe VSAM RLS cache structure to which the\r\ndata set was bound has either failed or has\r\nlost connectivity, and VSAM has been unable\r\neither to rebuild the failed cache structure, or\r\nto bind the data set to an alternative cache\r\nstructure in the cache set. The backout is\r\nautomatically retried when the cache structure\r\nbecomes available again.\r\nC4\r\nVSAM has returned a response indicating that\r\nthe RLS lock structure in the coupling facility\r\nis full. Allocate a larger lock structure, rebuild\r\ninto it and retry the backout using set dsname\r\nretry. See , (GC28-1779) and z/OS DFSMSdfp\r\nStorage Administration, (SC26-4920) for further\r\ninformation on how to allocate, and build into,\r\nlarger lock structures.\r\nF0\r\nThere was no space to add another alternate\r\nkey value to a non-unique alternate index. You\r\nshould rebuild the data set with a larger\r\nalternate index data CI size (unless you are\r\nalready at the maximum), and then retry the\r\nbackout using SET DSNAME RETRY. If you\r\naccessed the file in RLS mode, there are extra\r\nsteps required to ensure that the retained locks\r\nremain associated with the data set. These are\r\nexplained in the CICS Recovery and Restart\r\nGuide. Do not forward recover the data set.\r\nFB\r\nAn error occurred when opening the file for\r\nbackout. Determine why the file would not\r\nopen, and if it is possible to correct it, do so\r\nand then issue SET DSNAME RETRY to retry\r\nthe backout. If the error occurred because the\r\ndata set was quiesced, the backout is\r\nautomatically retried when the data set is\r\nunquiesced. If the error occurred because the\r\nVSAM RLS server was not available, the\r\nbackout is automatically retried when it\r\nbecomes available again.\r\nFE\r\nAn error occurred which is not expected to be\r\npossible during backout. An exception trace\r\npoint is written, message DFHFC4700 is issued\r\nand a system dump is taken. Use these to\r\ndetermine the cause of the error.

Message DFHME0116, which contains\r\nthe symptom string for this problem, is produced.\r\nUser response: Inform the system programmer. This\r\nindicates a possible error in CICS, VSAM or BDAM\r\ncode. The severity of its impact depends on whether\r\nthe backout can be successfully retried.\r\nIf the data set being backed out is a VSAM data set,\r\nyou can retry the backout. Message DFHFC4701 names\r\nthe data set, and the failed backout can be retried using\r\nSET DSNAME RETRY. If the problem is due to some\r\ntransient condition which has since cleared, the backout\r\nwill now succeed.\r\nIf the data set being backed out is a BDAM data set,\r\nthe backout cannot be retried. The data is committed\r\nand the locks are released, unless an exit program\r\nenabled at the XFCBFAIL exit point terminates CICS, in\r\nwhich case data integrity can be preserved by\r\nperforming an emergency restart.\r\nIf the backout cannot be successfully retried, then take\r\naction depending on the type of error indicated in the\r\nmessage text:\r\nv\r\nAn unexpected error\r\nThis probably indicates either a corruption of storage\r\nor an error within CICS code. It might also indicate\r\nan error within the access method called to process\r\nthe request (VSAM or BDAM).\r\nThe reason code xx is the reason code from the\r\nDFHFCFR parameter list and has been included as\r\nadditional documentation in case you need further\r\nhelp from IBM.\r\nThe access method code cccccccc is information\r\nreturned to file control in the VSAM RPL if the error\r\nwas detected by VSAM, or the BDAM DECB if the\r\nerror was detected by BDAM. For VSAM, the first\r\nbyte is the VSAM return code and the second byte is\r\nthe VSAM reason code; the third and fourth bytes\r\nmay contain additional VSAM diagnostics (for more\r\ninformation, see z/OS DFSMS Macro Instructions for\r\nData Sets). For BDAM, the access method code is the\r\n4-byte exception codes field from the DECB (for\r\nmore information, see z/OS DFSMS Using Data\r\nSets).\r\nv\r\nA VSAM error\r\nThis indicates that an error has occurred within\r\nVSAM.\r\nThe access method code cccccccc is information\r\nreturned to file control in the VSAM RPL. The first\r\nbyte is the VSAM return code and the second byte is\r\nthe VSAM reason code; the third and fourth bytes\r\nmay contain additional VSAM diagnostics (for more\r\ninformation, see z/OS DFSMS Macro Instructions for\r\nData Sets).\r\nv\r\nA length error\r\nWhen a length error is reported, the length error\r\ncode yy will be greater than X'01'. This normally\r\nindicates a serious error in CICS, VSAM, or BDAM\r\nprocessing. If it occurs for a BDAM data set, check\r\nthe FCT and DCB definitions in case there is a\r\nmismatch between, for example, the blocksizes,\r\nwhich would result in a length error.\r\nv\r\nA lock error\r\nThis indicates that backout processing has\r\nencountered a LOCKED response on attempting to\r\nacquire a lock on a record which is held as a retained\r\nlock by another unit of work. This should not be\r\npossible because the record should be locked by the\r\nunit of work being backed out. If this error occurs\r\nfor a file being accessed in RLS mode, then it\r\nprobably indicates an error in the SMSVSAM server.\r\nIf this error occurs for a file being accessed in\r\nnon-RLS mode, then it probably indicates an error in\r\nCICS enqueue processing.\r\nv\r\nA timeout error\r\nThis indicates that backout processing has timed out\r\nattempting to acquire an RLS lock. This should not\r\nbe possible during backout because the record\r\nshould already be locked by the unit of work being\r\nbacked out. If this error occurs then it probably\r\nindicates an error in the SMSVSAM server.\r\nv\r\nAn unexpected delete error\r\nThis indicates that the request to be backed out was\r\na delete request, but that the file type is one for\r\nwhich deletes are not supported (VSAM ESDS or\r\nBDAM). The most likely cause of this error would be\r\nsome corruption of the data set, although it might\r\nalso indicate an error within CICS, or a storage\r\ncorruption.\r\nYou may need assistance from IBM to resolve this\r\nproblem.
