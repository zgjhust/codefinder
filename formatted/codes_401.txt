A SYNCHRONIZATION CHECK occurs when the time difference between the two SMF records is less than\r\nssss .

This is due to one of the following reasons:\r\nv Some necessary SMF data was not included in the input.\r\nv In a multi-system environment, the clocks were not synchronized more closely than the interval between these\r\nchanges to the catalog, resulting in one of the following:\r\n\u2013 incorrect ordering of this insert and this update (The clock of the NEWER sysidwas behind the clock of the\r\nOLDERsysidby more than the time difference between these changes.)\r\n\u2013 incorrect ordering of an intervening delete by a different system (The clock on the system performing the\r\ndeletion was behind the clock of the OLDERsysidby more than the interval between the update and the delete\r\nor ahead of the clock of the NEWER sysidby more than the interval between the delete and the insert.)\r\nv Some necessary SMF data was lost.\r\nSystem action: After taking the action indicated in the last message line, the condition code is set to 8 (if not already\r\nhigher) and processing continues.\r\nOperator response: Take the following actions:\r\n1. Review the reports and messages from CRURRSV, Record Selection and Validation, for lost or omitted SMF data.\r\nIf SMF data was omitted, supply the missing data and re-execute this recovery.\r\n2. If all SMF data is accounted for, save this log for use with the diagnostic information to be gathered after the\r\noutput data set is imported. When the output of IDCAMS LISTCAT and IDCAMS DIAGNOSE is available,\r\nproceed as follows:\r\n3. If this message is accompanied by a synchronization check (or if these two SMF records are from different\r\nsystems and their times differ by only a small amount), assume that the records are reversed and that the\r\nUPDATE is more current.\r\nv Look for the data set or VSAM components on the volumes from the UPDATE record. For VSAM, use\r\nIDCAMS DIAGNOSE COMPARE. For nonVSAM data sets, use IEHLIST LISTVTOC ...,DSNAME=.... To locate a\r\ntape data set, look in the tape management inventory (or on the actual tape volume).\r\nv If the data set or component is on the indicated volumes, DELETE the existing catalog entry with\r\nNOSCRATCH and redefine it with DEFINE NONVSAM or DEFINE CLUSTER RECATALOG.\r\nv If the UPDATE catalog record is not correct with respect to its volumes, proceed with the next step.\r\n4. Review the chain of messages for this entry, looking for the missing DELETE. If a DELETE appears near the top\r\nof the chain, probably with a synchronization check or another error message, then the NEWER INSERT may be\r\nassumed to be the most current record. You can confirm using the steps outlined above. If you are uncertain that\r\nthis is the case, continue with the next step.\r\n5. If neither of the above apply, assume that SMF data has been lost. Further assume that one of the missing records\r\nis for this catalog entry.\r\na. If the entry appears in the IDCAMS LISTCAT and if IDCAMS DIAGNOSE does not find it to be in error,\r\nconfirm that the data set or each component of a VSAM sphere is actually on the volumes indicated by\r\nLISTCAT.\r\nThe IDCAMS DIAGNOSE with the COMPARE option will accomplish this for VSAM entries. For nonVSAM\r\nentries, check the VTOC for disk data sets. For data sets on tape, check the tape data set inventory, if a tape\r\nmanagement system is in use, or actually check the tape volume. For all data set types you could also run\r\nIDCAMS PRINT IDS(entry.name) COUNT(1) to DD DUMMY (if you use standard-label tapes and if you have\r\na small number of these messages so that the number of tape mounts is tolerable).\r\nb. If the data set and each component is present on the volumes, then assume that this entry is the most current\r\none and no further action is required.\r\nc. If the entry does not diagnose correctly, or if it mismatches the data volumes, then SMF data has been lost and\r\na correct catalog entry must be built.\r\nd. Make a note of the volumes on which the data set was last known to reside and then delete the existing\r\ncatalog entry specifying NOSCRATCH.\r\ne. If the component is not subsequently found on any volume, then we are finished.\r\nf. If the data set name tells you that this was a data set that can be easily recreated or is otherwise not essential,\r\nallow volume cleanup processing to scratch the data set when it is encountered.\r\ng. If is necessary to locate a disk data set, examine the VTOCs of all volumes that might contain the data set. For\r\nVSAM data sets, IDCAMS DIAGNOSE VVDS will do this.

A SYNCHRONIZATION CHECK occurs when the time difference between the two SMF records is less than\r\nssss . NO SYNCHRONIZATION CHECK means the SMF time difference is larger than ssss , or that synchronization\r\nchecking was bypassed because ONLY ONE SYSTEM IS INVOLVED or because the CLOCK DIFFERENCE was\r\ndefaulted, spec = NONE, or was specified asspec = 0000.\r\nEither a record for insertion of this entry should have appeared between these two records or these two records are\r\nout of sequence. This is due to one of the following reasons:\r\nv Some necessary SMF data was not included in the input.\r\nv In a multi-system environment, the clocks were not synchronized more closely than the interval between these\r\nchanges to the catalog, resulting in one of the following:\r\n\u2013 incorrect ordering of this update and this delete (The clock of the NEWER sysidwas behind the clock of the\r\nOLDERsysidby more than the time difference between these changes.)\r\n\u2013 incorrect ordering of an intervening INSERT by a different system (The clock on the system performing the\r\ninsertion was behind the clock of the OLDER sysidby more than the interval between the DELETE and the\r\nINSERT or ahead of the clock of the NEWER sysidby more than the interval between the INSERT and the\r\nUPDATE.)\r\nv Some necessary SMF data was lost.\r\nSystem action: After taking the action indicated in the last message line, the condition code is set to 8 (if not already\r\nhigher) and processing continues.\r\nOperator response: Take the following actions:\r\n1. Review the reports and messages from CRURRSV, Record Selection and Validation, for lost or omitted SMF data.\r\nIf SMF data was omitted, supply the missing data and re-execute this recovery.\r\n2. If all SMF data is accounted for, save this log for use with the diagnostic information to be gathered after the\r\noutput data set is imported. When the output of IDCAMS LISTCAT and IDCAMS DIAGNOSE is available,\r\nproceed as follows:\r\n3. If this message is accompanied by a synchronization check (or if these two SMF records are from different\r\nsystems and their times differ by only a small amount), assume that the records are reversed and that the\r\nDELETE is more current.\r\nv Look for the data set or VSAM components on the volumes from the DELETE record. For VSAM, use IDCAMS\r\nDIAGNOSE COMPARE. For nonVSAM data sets, use IEHLIST LISTVTOC ...,DSNAME=.... To locate a tape data\r\nset, look in the tape management inventory (or on the actual tape volume).\r\nv If the data set or component is not on the indicated volumes, DELETE the existing catalog entry with\r\nNOSCRATCH.\r\nv If the DELETE catalog record is not correct,that is, the data set or component is on the indicated volumes,\r\nproceed with the next step.\r\n4. Review the chain of messages for this entry, looking for the missing INSERT. If an INSERT appears near the top\r\nof the chain, probably with a synchronization check or another error message, then the NEWER UPDATE may be\r\nassumed to be the most current record. You can confirm using the steps outlined above. If you are uncertain that\r\nthis is the case, continue with the next step.\r\n5. If neither of the above apply, assume that SMF data has been lost. Further assume that one of the missing records\r\nis for this catalog entry.\r\na. If the entry appears in the IDCAMS LISTCAT and if IDCAMS DIAGNOSE does not find it to be in error,\r\nconfirm that the data set or each component of a VSAM sphere is actually on the volumes indicated by\r\nLISTCAT.\r\nThe IDCAMS DIAGNOSE with the COMPARE option will accomplish this for VSAM entries. For nonVSAM\r\nentries, check the VTOC for disk data sets. For data sets on tape, check the tape data set inventory, if a tape\r\nmanagement system is in use, or actually check the tape volume. For all data set types you could also run\r\nIDCAMS PRINT IDS(entry.name) COUNT(1) to DD DUMMY (if you use standard-label tapes and if you have\r\na small number of these messages so that the number of tape mounts is tolerable).\r\nb. If the data set and each component is present on the volumes, then assume that this entry is the most current\r\none and no further action is required.\r\nc. If the entry does not diagnose correctly, or if it mismatches the data volumes, then SMF data has been lost and\r\na correct catalog entry must be built.\r\nd. Make a note of the volumes on which the data set was last known to reside and then delete the existing\r\ncatalog entry specifying NOSCRATCH.\r\ne. If the component is not subsequently found on any volume, then we are finished.\r\nf. If the data set name tells you that this was a data set that can be easily recreated or is otherwise not essential,\r\nallow volume cleanup processing to scratch the data set when it is encountered.\r\ng. If is necessary to locate a disk data set, examine the VTOCs of all volumes that might contain the data set. For\r\nVSAM data sets, IDCAMS DIAGNOSE VVDS will do this. To locate a tape data set, look in the tape\r\nmanagement inventory.\r\nh.

A SYNCHRONIZATION CHECK occurs when the time difference between the two SMF records is less than\r\nssss . NO SYNCHRONIZATION CHECK means the SMF time difference is larger than ssss , or that synchronization\r\nchecking was bypassed because ONLY ONE SYSTEM IS INVOLVED or because the CLOCK DIFFERENCE was\r\ndefaulted, spec = NONE, or was specified asspec = 0000.\r\nA record for deletion of this entry should have appeared between these two records, but none was found for one of\r\nthe following reasons:\r\nv Some necessary SMF data was not included in the input.\r\nv In a multi-system environment, the clocks were not synchronized more closely than the interval between these\r\nchanges to the catalog, resulting in the incorrect ordering of an intervening delete by a different system. (The clock\r\non the system performing the deletion was behind the clock of the OLDER sysidby more than the interval between\r\nthe update and the delete or ahead of the clock of the NEWER sysidby more than the interval between the delete\r\nand the insert.)\r\nv Some necessary SMF data was lost.\r\nSystem action: After taking the action indicated in the last message line, the condition code is set to 8 (if not already\r\nhigher) and processing continues.\r\nOperator response: Take the following actions:\r\n1. Review the reports and messages from CRURRSV, Record Selection and Validation, for lost or omitted SMF data.\r\nIf SMF data was omitted, supply the missing data and re-execute this recovery.\r\n2. Review the chain of messages for this entry, looking for the missing DELETE. If a DELETE appears near the top\r\nof the chain, probably with a synchronization check or another error message, the records are most likely out of\r\nsequence and the NEWER INSERT may be assumed to be the most current record. If you are uncertain that this is\r\nthe case, continue with the next step.\r\n3. If neither of the above apply, assume that SMF data has been lost. Further assume that one of the missing records\r\nis for this catalog entry and save this log for use with the diagnostic information to be gathered after the output\r\ndata set is imported. When the output of IDCAMS LISTCAT and IDCAMS DIAGNOSE is available, proceed as\r\nfollows:\r\na. If the entry appears in the IDCAMS LISTCAT and if IDCAMS DIAGNOSE does not find it to be in error,\r\nconfirm that the data set or each component of a VSAM sphere is actually on the volumes indicated by\r\nLISTCAT. The IDCAMS DIAGNOSE with the COMPARE option will accomplish this for VSAM entries. For\r\nnonVSAM entries, check the VTOC for disk data sets. For data sets on tape, check the tape data set inventory,\r\nif a tape management system is in use, or actually check the tape volume. You could also run IDCAMS PRINT\r\nIDS(entry.name) COUNT(1) to DD DUMMY for all data set types, if you use standard-label tapes and if you\r\ndon't have so many tape data sets as to make the number of mounts intolerable.\r\nb.

OAM expected a tape drive to be allocated by MVS. The type\r\nof tape drive that OAM attempted to allocate is specified by unit-name. The data set name being allocated is dsn.

The most likely cause of this error is a programming logic error in the SMS storage class and storage group\r\nACS routines. The system programmer may have inadvertently assigned a POOL type storage group in the SMS\r\nstorage group ACS routine, to an OAM tape allocation request.

Prior to Release 1.7 of the TS7700 (PGA1),\r\nthe threshold was defined at 95% of the configured cache capacity and starting with that release, the threshold is\r\nnow defined at 1 TB below the configured cache capacity.

This state takes into account the number of jobs (devices) that are\r\nwriting data to ensure that currently running jobs can complete. At a minimum, this state can also be entered when\r\nthe amount of free space falls below 500 gigabytes (might be entered sooner based on the number of jobs that are\r\nrunning and the projected cache usage). As the available cache space continues to decline, the TS7680 might also\r\nreach a point where it needs to throttle the write activity of currently running jobs resulting in job delays.\r\nSystem action: Mount operations that have been accepted before entering this state complete and volumes currently\r\nmounted can continue to perform host I/O operations.

Starting with Release\r\n1.7 of the TS7700, distributed libraries that are in this state will not be chosen as a tape volume cache during scratch\r\nmounts and specific mounts will favor distributed libraries that are not in this state.

Often this means that the original userid created in the DB2 tables is no longer valid. Review the\r\n\"OSMC Application Plans\" section in Creating DB2 Databases for Object Tables and Directories in z/OS DFSMS OAM\r\nPlanning, Installation, and Storage Administration Guide for Object Support . As the information in this section indicates,\r\nthe USERID associated with the bind job must be the same as the USERID associated with the CBRSAMPL job that\r\ncreates the OAM configuration database because the SQL statements in the plans contain unqualified DB2 table\r\nnames. DB2 assumes the unqualified table name is also the authorization ID of the binder.\r\nTo correct this problem, use the following DB2 bypass that adds the following to the migration and bind jobs, where\r\nCBRADMIN is the sample ID used:\r\nDSN SYSTEM(xxxx)\r\nDSN SET CURRENT SQLID=\u2019CBRADMIN\u2019 <----- ID\r\nDSN BIND....\r\nAfter correcting the USERID, you must run the OAM binds. Run CBRPBIND, again with correct USERID, followed\r\nby the CBRABIND and CBRHBIND bind jobs. You must also run the CBRHGRNT SAMPLIB job to grant authority to\r\nuse the application plans, as mentioned in the \"OSMC Application Plans\" in Creating DB2 Databases for Object\r\nTables and Directories inz/OS DFSMS OAM Planning, Installation, and Storage Administration Guide for Object Support .\r\nAfter running all the OAM jobs, binds, and grants, you must also run the application binds.\r\nNote that in an OAMPLEX, it is crucial that the OAM CBRPBIND job is run from the highest level system in the\r\nplex.\r\nFor information on SQL error reason codes, visit the DB2 information center at http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/\r\ninfocenter/imzic.\r\nSource: Object Access Method (OAM)\r\nRouting Code: 2\r\nDescriptor Code: 4", "CBR3252I": " Gripper 2 full sensor fault occurred selecting a cartridge in librarylibrary-name.\r\nExplanation: An I/O error has occurred implementing a library command.

If the entry appears in the IDCAMS LISTCAT and if IDCAMS DIAGNOSE does not find it to be in error,\r\nconfirm that the data set or each component of a VSAM sphere is actually on the volumes indicated by\r\nLISTCAT. The IDCAMS DIAGNOSE with the COMPARE option will accomplish this for VSAM entries. For\r\nnonVSAM entries, check the VTOC for disk data sets. For data sets on tape, check the tape data set inventory,\r\nif a tape management system is in use, or actually check the tape volume. You could also run IDCAMS PRINT\r\nIDS(entry.name) COUNT(1) to DD DUMMY for all data set types, if you use standard-label tapes and if you\r\ndon't have so many tape data sets as to make the number of mounts intolerable.\r\nb. If the data set and each component is present on the volumes, then assume that this entry is the most current\r\none and no further action is required.\r\nc. If the entry does not diagnose correctly, or if it mismatches the data volumes, then SMF data has been lost and\r\nthis entry is not the most current one for one of the following reasons:\r\nv The data set, sphere or component no longer exists and the catalog entry should be deleted.\r\nv The data set, sphere or component now exists on different volumes and a correct catalog entry for this data\r\nset or VSAM sphere must be built.\r\nd.

If is necessary to locate a disk data set, examine the VTOCs of all volumes that might contain the data set. For\r\nVSAM data sets, IDCAMS DIAGNOSE VVDS will do this. For nonVSAM data sets, use IEHLIST LISTVTOC\r\n...,DSNAME=.... You could also use DFSMSdss with the NORUN option to DUMP ...BY(CATLG,EQ,NO)... .\r\nh.

THIS USE IS ACCEPTED.\r\nDDNAME=ddname\r\nExplanation: This message was issued because of one of the following:\r\n1. The resource pool requested on the SHRPOOL subparameter on a local shared resource (LSR) request was in use,\r\nbut the system will reuse the pool. The pool might be in use for one of the following reasons:\r\nv Two DDNAMEs requested allocation for SHRPOOL n to reuse the pool\r\nv A dynamic allocation request to batch LSR was issued previously. That request either explicitly specified\r\nSHRPOOL n, or did not specify a pool identifier and the system selected resource pool n.\r\nv A VSAM BLDVRP macro request for SHRPOOL n was issued previously. The resource pool was not requested\r\nby batch LSR.\r\n2. An open data set was already using the VSAM data resource pool. The system will use the VSAM resource index\r\npool for this request, if the index pool exists. Otherwise, the system will use data pooln for both index and data\r\nbuffers. If your program is using batch LSR to share a resource pool between multiple data sets, some of which\r\nare indexed (NSDS) but others are not (ESDS or RSDS), the system does not build the index pool unless the first\r\ndata set to be opened is indexed.\r\nThis message only appears if the parameter MSG=I is specified on the batch local shared resources (LSR) SUBSYS\r\nstatement.\r\nIn the message text:\r\ncomponent\r\nSpecifies either DATA or INDEX.\r\nn The resource pool ID requested via SHRPOOL=n on the LSR request.\r\nddname The ddname for the job that cannot make use of LSR.\r\nSystem action: The system continues processing the job.\r\nProgrammer response: If you intended to reuse resource pool n, ignore this message.

The\r\nALLOCRETRYMINUTES value represents the maximum number of minutes OAM will attempt allocation retries\r\nprior to issuing the CBR6400D message that gives the operator an opportunity to cancel the request. Valid values for\r\nALLOCRETRYMINUTES are 0-5. The default value is 5 if ALLOCRETRYMINUTES is not specified in the\r\nCBROAMxx Parmlib member. A value of 0 results in a time duration of 0 seconds before CBR6425I is issued. A value\r\nof 1-5 results in a time duration of 1 minute before the CBR6425I message is issued.\r\nIf the operator replies 'C' (meaning cancel), OAM will fail the tape drive allocation and its associated OAM request.\r\nAny other reply will cause OAM to issue this message again, along with its previously issued corresponding CBR6425I message.\r\nOperator response: Determine if there are any tape drives which could be used to satisfy this request (either online\r\nor offline) prior to responding to this message.\r\nIf this message has an imbedded VOLSER that is not SCRTCH then:\r\nv Determine if this tape volume is in a tape library.

This specification is at the global level and pertains to all OSREQ QUERY processing.\r\nv QB=Y indicates that OSREQ QUERY requests result in a call into the OAM address space for each backup copy.\r\nThe OSREQ QUERY returns a complete backup retrieval order key for each backup copy. If a backup copy does\r\nnot exist, the OAM address space is not called, and the backup retrieval order key contains binary zeros. This is\r\nthe default.\r\nv QB=N indicates that OSREQ QUERY requests do not result in a call into the OAM address space for each backup\r\ncopy. The backup retrieval order key contains binary zeros for each backup copy regardless if the backup copy\r\nexists or not.\r\nMOS=xxxx specifies the maximum object size limit in MB. Valid values are 50-2000. If this keyword is omitted, the\r\nmaximum supported object size remains at 50MB. The maximum object size is checked when objects are initially\r\nstored through the OSREQ programming interface and is not checked on subsequent retrievals. OTIS=x specifies\r\nwhether OTIS should wait for JES to completely initialize before OTIS is started:\r\nv OTIS=Y indicates that OTIS does not start until JES is completely initialized.\r\nv OTIS=N indicates that OTIS starts independently from JES. This is the default.\r\nLOB=x specifies whether OAM exploits DB2 LOB support for large objects that exceed 32 KB (32640 bytes). LOB has\r\nthe following options:\r\nv LOB=A indicates that, for all storage groups, objects that exceed 32 KB are to be stored in a LOB storage structure\r\nwhen stored to DB2. LOB=A indicates to OAM that the installation has created LOB storage structures and\r\nassociated V_OSM_LOB_BASE_TBL views for ALL object storage groups defined in the ACDS. This results in\r\noptimal performance when you want to store large objects (greater than 32 KB) to DB2 because OAM does not\r\nquery DB2 to see if the LOB base table view exists. If the LOB base table view does not exist, the large object store\r\nfails.\r\nv LOB=P indicates to OAM that the installation has created LOB storage structures and associated\r\nV_OSM_LOB_BASE_TBL views for a PARTIAL list of object storage groups defined in the ACDS.

This volume serial\r\nnumber should be the same as vol1 .\r\nt2 Volume type for optical volume vol3 , indicating whether it is a grouped, backup, nongrouped, or scratch\r\nvolume.\r\nb2 Volume backup type for volume vol3 , indicating whether it is used for first or second backup copies of\r\nobjects, if the volume type indicates it is a backup volume.\r\ngrpname2\r\nObject or object backup storage group for volume vol3 .\r\nlib2 Library name of the library that contains optical volume vol3 . This library name should be the same as lib1 .\r\nst2 Slot name of the slot that contains optical volume vol3 . This slot name should be the same as st1.\r\nplib2 Pseudo library forvol3 when it is ejected from a 3995 optical library and shelf resident.

This XCF member\r\nname should be the same as xcf-member-1 .\r\nreasons Reasons why the volume table is inconsistent:\r\nv 1- Volume table indicates that optical volume vol1 resides in library lib1 in slot st1. The opposite side\r\nvolume is vol2 . However, there is no row in the Volume Table for optical volume vol2 .\r\nv 2 - Volume table indicates that optical volume vol1 resides in library lib1 in slot st1. The opposite side\r\nvolume is vol2 . However, the row in the Volume Table for optical volume vol2 indicates that the opposite\r\nside of optical volumevol2 is vol4 , which is different from vol1 .\r\nv 3- Volume table indicates that optical volume vol1 resides in library lib1 in slot st1. The opposite side\r\nvolume is vol2 . However, the row in the Volume Table for optical volume vol2 indicates that volume vol2\r\nresides in library lib2 , which is different from lib1 .\r\nv 4 - Volume table indicates that optical volume vol1 resides in library lib1 in slot st1. The opposite side\r\nvolume is vol2 . However, the row in the Volume Table for optical volume vol2 indicates that volume vol2\r\nresides in slot st2, which is different from st1.\r\nv 14 - Volume table indicates that optical volume vol1 resides in pseudo library plib as its designated pseudo\r\nlibrary when it is shelf resident. The opposite side volume, vol3 indicates its pseudo library is plib2, which\r\nis different from plib1.\r\nv 15 - Volume table indicates that optical volume vol1 is currently being managed and controlled by OAM\r\nmember xcf-member-1 . The opposite side volume, vol3 indicates it is currently being managed and\r\ncontrolled by OAM member xcf-member-2 , which is different from xcf-member-1 .\r\nv 16 - Volume table indicates that optical volume vol1 is assigned to group grpname1. The opposite side\r\nvolume vol3 indicates it is assigned to group grpname2, which is different from grpname1.\r\nv 17 - Volume table indicates that optical volume vol1 is a volume type of t1 . The opposite side volume vol3\r\nindicates it is a volume type of t2 , which is different from t1 .\r\nv 18 - Volume table indicates that optical volume vol1 is a backup volume with a backup type of b1 . The\r\nopposite side volume vol3 indicates it is a backup volume with a backup type of b2 , which is different\r\nfrom b1 .\r\nSystem action: OAM initialization stops.\r\nOperator response: Notify the system programmer.\r\nSystem programmer response: Make the appropriate corrections in the Volume Table in the DB2 optical\r\nconfiguration database using SPUFI.\r\nSource: Object Access Method (OAM)\r\nRouting Code: 2\r\nDescriptor Code: 4", "CPO1044I": " Content of domain configuration file namesuccessfully retrieved\r\nExplanation: The GET CONFIGURATION command successfully retrieved the content of the file for the referenced\r\ndomain configuration.\r\nUser response: None.", "CBR3243I": " RAM update failure in library library-name.\r\nExplanation: An attempt to update a portion of the RAM failed in librarylibrary-name.\r\nSystem action: The request is rejected and the failing component is marked not operational.\r\nOperator response: Contact hardware support.\r\nSystem programmer response: For information on library errors, consult Filenet OSAR Library Unit Product\r\nDescription.

For a library that resides in a 3584 tape library, the\r\nstorage slot count is associated with a particular logical library. For other tape libraries, the storage slot\r\ncount reflects the number of storage slots in the entire physical library. Also, starting from Release 1.5 of the\r\nTS7740 (3957-V06), when the TS7740 is installed in a 3584 tape library (with ALMS), the distributed library\r\nno longer surfaces the physical slot information and instead surfaces virtual slot information.\r\nFor a TS7680, this count displays the number of logical volumes that can be defined to the library.\r\nppppppp\r\nTotal number of empty slots in the tape library dataserver.

For a Peer-to-Peer VTS subsystem, this information can be obtained by\r\ndisplaying the distributed libraries associated with the composite library. This count is suppressed if the library being\r\ndisplayed is a TS7720 (3957-VEx).\r\nThe private stacked volume count will only be displayed for a virtual tape server (VTS) library; it indicates the\r\nnumber of physical stacked private volumes. For a Peer-to-Peer VTS subsystem, this information can be obtained by\r\ndisplaying the distributed libraries associated with the composite library. This count is suppressed if the library being\r\ndisplayed is a TS7720 (3957-VEx).\r\nThe corrupted token volume count will only be displayed for a Peer-to-Peer virtual tape server (VTS) library and\r\nindicates the number of volumes in the corrupted token category. For a Peer-to-Peer VTS subsystem, this information\r\ncan be obtained by displaying the composite library. For corrective action, contact your hardware service\r\nrepresentative.\r\nFor a VTS composite library, the operational state that is returned to the host is determined by examining the states\r\nof the underlying distributed libraries, with much of the other status (for instance, I/O station-related status) being\r\nprovided from the designated user interface library. Also, since all of the drives and volumes are defined to and\r\nassociated with the composite library, the display of a distributed library will show that, from a host perspective,\r\nthere are no volumes and drives associated with that library. The distributed libraries should be displayed for an\r\naccurate picture of the total and empty slot counts (the slot counts associated with the composite library are zero).\r\nThe high capacity input and output station lines will only be displayed for an automated tape library dataserver and\r\nonly if the station has been configured.\r\nFor an automated tape library data server, additional status lines may appear containing one or more of the\r\nfollowing messages:\r\nv Operation degraded due to unavailable hardware resource.\r\nv Safety enclosure interlock open.\r\nv Vision system not operational.\r\nv Library manager offline.\r\nv Operator intervention required.\r\nv Library manager check 1 condition.\r\nv All storage slots full.\r\nv Out of cleaner volumes.\r\nv Dual write disabled.\r\nv Environmental alert.\r\nv Library manager switchover in progress.\r\nv Copy operations disabled.\r\nv VTS operations degraded.\r\nv Immediate Mode Copy operations deferred.\r\nv Service preparation occurring in distributed librarylibrary-name.\r\nv Service preparation occurring.\r\nv All convenience input stations empty.\r\nv All convenience output stations empty.\r\nv All convenience output stations full.\r\nv {Bulk Input/Output | Output} {Configured | Not configured}.\r\nv High capacity output station full.\r\nv {Input | Output} door is open.\r\nv Convenience I/O station installed.\r\nv Convenience I/O station in {Input | Output | Import mode}.\r\nv Convenience I/O station {Empty | Full}.\r\nv Single cell output facility in use for eject.\r\nv Host initiated import in process.\r\nv Host initiated export in process.\r\nv Library initiated single volume import in process.\r\nv Library is out of empty stacked volumes.\r\nv Library has insufficient resources to continue mount processing.\r\nv Library supports import/export.\r\nv Library supports outboard policy management.\r\nv Limited cache free space \u2013 warning state.\r\nv Out of cache resources \u2013 critical state.\r\nv Forced pause occurred.\r\nv Grid links degraded.\r\nv Library supports logical WORM.\r\nv Copy operations disabled by operator command.\r\nv Synchronous mode copy operations deferred.\r\nv Library enabled for scratch allocation assistance.\r\nSource: Object Access Method (OAM)\r\nRouting Code: -Descriptor Code: 5,8,9", "CPO1169E": " Target modelnamehas more capacity than is currently active\r\nExplanation: The DEACTIVATE RESOURCE command with the CPC and MODEL parameters has been issued.

The graph's Y-axis shows the percentage\r\nof time spent on a message rate, and the X-axis who's instantaneous message rates (in messages / second). The\r\nX-axis scale is logarithmic with each character position being a factor of two, greater than the previous position in the\r\nrightward direction. Tick marks are provided at 8X intervals. The Y-axis is of variable length, with a default length of\r\n25 lines. Any value from 0 to 999 is acceptable on the command, but it will be adjusted to the range 8 to 200. The\r\nactual value used is selected to provide readable increments on the Y-axis.\r\nEach vertical bar of asterisks in the graph is rightward cumulative. That is each bar represents not only the fraction\r\nof time at its own rate, but the fraction of time with a lesser rate. (A bar's own contribution to the time at a given\r\nmessage rate is therefore the difference between its height and the height of its immediate leftward neighbor).\r\nA vertical line (|) indicates the most common message rate. On the X-axis, the minimum and maximum message\r\nrates recorded are indicated (by the > and < symbols, respectively). These are indicated on either side of the mean\r\nmessage rate. The percentage of messages occurring at the maximum message rate is usually quite small and cannot\r\nbe visible unless the resolution of the graph is improved by increasing the number of lines in the graph.\r\nThe graph must have a characteristic \"S\" shape to it caused by relatively few messages occurring at very low message\r\nrates (the bottom left of the \"S\" curve) and very few messages occurring at very high message rates (the top right of\r\nthe \"S\" curve).\r\nThe graph presents instantaneous message rates that are determined from the inter-arrival times of the messages.\r\nSmall inter-arrival times result in high instantaneous message rates. Large inter-arrival times result in low\r\ninstantaneous message rates. A high message rate on the graph does not necessarily imply that multiple, consecutive\r\nmessages were issued at that rate. It is quite possible for a high message rate to be indicated without Message Flood\r\nAutomation being triggered.

(The clock\r\non the system performing the insert was behind the clock of the OLDER sysidby more than the interval between\r\nthe INSERT and the OLDER DELETE or ahead of the clock of the NEWER sysidby more than the interval between\r\nthe INSERT and the NEWER DELETE.)\r\nv Some necessary SMF data was lost.\r\nSystem action: After taking the action indicated in the last message line, the condition code is set to 8 (if not already\r\nhigher) and processing continues.\r\nOperator response: Take the following actions:\r\n1. Review the reports and messages from CRURRSV, Record Selection and Validation, for lost or omitted SMF data.\r\nIf SMF data was omitted, supply the missing data and re-execute this recovery.\r\n2. If all SMF data is accounted for, save this log for use with the diagnostic information to be gathered after the\r\noutput data set is imported. When the output of IDCAMS LISTCAT and IDCAMS DIAGNOSE is available,\r\nproceed as follows:\r\n3. Review the chain of messages for this entry, looking for the missing INSERT. If an INSERT appears near the top\r\nof the chain, probably with a synchronization check or another error message, then the NEWER DELETE may be\r\nassumed to be the most current record. Confirm that the data set or a component of the VSAM sphere is not\r\nactually on the volumes indicated in the dumped DELETE record. The IDCAMS DIAGNOSE with the COMPARE\r\noption will accomplish this for VSAM entries. For nonVSAM entries, check the VTOC for disk data sets. For data\r\nsets on tape, check the tape data set inventory, if a tape management system is in use, or actually check the tape\r\nvolume. If you are uncertain that this is the case, continue with the next step.\r\n4. If neither of the above apply, assume that SMF data has been lost. Further assume that one of the missing records\r\nis for this catalog entry.\r\na. The entry will not appear in the IDCAMS LISTCAT output. Use the volume information from the dumped\r\nrecords. Look for recognizable volume serials information in the interpreted portion of the dump.\r\nb. For nonVSAM entries, check the VTOC for disk data sets. For VSAM data sets, IDCAMS DIAGNOSE VVDS\r\nwill do this. For data sets on tape, check the tape data set inventory, if a tape management system is in use, or\r\nactually check the tape volume. You could also run IDCAMS for all data set types using PRINT\r\nINFILE(ddname) COUNT(1) to DD DUMMY with a DD statement for the volumes in question if you use\r\nstandard-label tapes and if you don't have so many tape data sets as to make the number of mounts\r\nintolerable.\r\nc. If the data set or a component of a VSAM sphere is not subsequently found on any volume, then we are\r\nfinished.\r\nd.

CSVH0979I has been placed in the message buffer for each LNKLST LNKLST set. It lists all data sets with secondary space defined.  IBM suggests that partitioned data sets (PDS's) in the LNKLST be allocated with only primary extents, for two reasons. First, a PDS allocated with only primary space defined has only one extent. This makes it easier to stay within the 255-extent limit for an active LNKLST concatenation without having to reallocate data sets with fewer initial extents. Second, if a PDS will be updated while in the LNKLST set, it can be extended if it has been allocated using secondary space. This can cause members to be placed in extents that did not exist when the LNKLST concatenation was activated. An attempt to access a member in a new extent causes the requesting program to abend.

For nonVSAM\r\nentries, check the VTOC for disk data sets.

If the data set and each component is present on the volumes, then assume that this entry is the most current\r\none and no further action is required.\r\nc. If the entry does not diagnose correctly, or if it mismatches the data volumes, then SMF data has been lost and\r\nthis entry is not the most current one for one of the following reasons:\r\nv The data set, sphere or component no longer exists and the catalog entry should be deleted.\r\nv The data set, sphere or component now exists on different volumes and a correct catalog entry for this data\r\nset or VSAM sphere must be built.\r\nd.

If is necessary to locate a disk data set, examine the VTOCs of all volumes that might contain the data set. For\r\nVSAM data sets, IDCAMS DIAGNOSE VVDS will do this. For nonVSAM data sets, use IEHLIST LISTVTOC\r\n...,DSNAME=.... You could also use DFSMSdss with the NORUN option to DUMP ...BY(CATLG,EQ,NO)... .\r\nh.
